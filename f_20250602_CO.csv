Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said.

Michalek named the suspect as Mohamed Soliman, who was hospitalised shortly after the attack.

FBI Director Kash Patel also described the incident as a “targeted terror attack”, and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted”.

(AP) — A man with a makeshift flamethrower yelled “Free Palestine” and hurled an incendiary device into a group that had assembled to raise attention for Israeli hostages in Gaza, law enforcement officials said Sunday. Eight people were injured, some with burns.

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was booked into the Boulder County jail north of Denver and expected to face charges in connection with the attack the FBI was investigating as a terrorist act. Online records did not immediately show when he would make a court appearance.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said.

Across the U.S., the New York Police Department said it has upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

As people tried to help the woman on the ground, another woman who appeared to be a participant in the event yelled to others out of the camera’s view, defending their cause, saying they don’t talk about the government but just talk about the hostages.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then ""two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Segal, who said she is Jewish on her father’s side and has supported Palestine for more than 40 years, was concerned that she might be accused of helping the suspect because she was wearing a pro-Palestine shirt.

“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” she said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.""

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

This story has been updated to correct that 10 people, not four, were killed in the Boulder grocery store shooting.

A group of people in Boulder, Colorado, were holding a regular demonstration to raise awareness of Hamas-held hostages in Gaza when they were allegedly targeted by a man who shouted ""Free Palestine"" on Sunday.

The suspect, who police named as 45-year-old Mohamd Sabry Soliman, was arrested at the scene.

Earlier on Monday, Soliman - from El Paso County in Colorado - was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Boulder Police in Colorado have since confirmed on X that no victims have died.

Four women and four men aged between 52 and 88 were injured and taken to hospitals, Boulder police said.

The force said the injuries ranged from ""very serious"" to ""more minor"".

Some of the victims were airlifted to the hospital.

Authorities had earlier put the number of injured at six and said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

The FBI says the attack was a targeted ""act of terrorism"".

Soliman was also taken to hospital after the alleged attack.

Eyewitnesses said the suspect threw Molotov cocktails, an improvised bomb made from a bottle filled with petrol and stuffed with a piece of cloth to use as a fuse, into people attending the demonstration.

He also used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" during the attack, according to Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office.

Two senior law enforcement officials told Sky News' US partner network that Soliman is an Egyptian national who seemingly acted alone. They said he has no previous significant contact with law enforcement.

The White House described the suspect as an ""illegal alien"" who had received a work permit under the Biden administration despite overstaying a tourist visa.

A large part of downtown Boulder was cordoned off as sniffer dogs and the bomb squad searched for potential devices.

Police chief Steve Redfearn said the attack happened around 1.26pm local time on Sunday and that initial reports were that ""people were being set on fire"".

""When we arrived we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns,"" Mr Redfearn told the media.

The police chief also said he did not believe anyone else was involved.

""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

Boulder's police chief said the attack happened as a ""group of pro-Israel people"" were peacefully demonstrating.

The walk is held regularly by a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives, which aims to raise awareness of the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Video from the scene showed a bare-chested man shouting and clutching two bottles after the attack.

Other footage showed him being held down and arrested by police as people doused one of the victims with water.

Nearby, there appeared to be a large black burn mark on the ground.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old student, described seeing four women on the ground with burns on their legs. She said one appeared badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass

bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

""Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water,'"" Ms Coffman said.

Lady on fire 'from head to toe'

Another eyewitness, who did not give his name, said: ""It was very strange to just hear a crash on the ground of a bottle breaking and then it sounded like a boom and then people started yelling and screaming.

""But I saw fire, I saw people screaming and crying and tripping and I saw the attacker - he had three Molotov cocktails.

""One of them he threw inside a group and one lady lit on fire from head to toe and then the other four people were also injured in the fire, but not as bad as the first one.""

The eyewitness continued: ""The attacker came out from the bushes and the trees... he threw another cocktail, and on the second one he lit himself on fire - I imagine accidentally.

""He seemed to have a bulletproof vest on, or some kind of vest, and then a shirt underneath it.

""And after he lit himself on fire he took off the vest and the shirt and he was shirtless.

""But he still had his Molotov cocktails in his hands ready to use them... ready to throw them and explode them on people.""

Lynn Segal, another eyewitness, said: ""These shoots of fire, linear, about 20 feet long, spears of fire, two of them at least, came across right into the group, about 15 feet from me.""

The 72-year-old said two neighbours of hers, a husband and wife in their 80s, were at the demonstration. She added that the wife was one of the victims and appeared to be the most seriously injured.

""They're both elders in their 80s, and you can't take something like this assault to your body as easily as someone younger.""

A statement from Boulder's Jewish community said ""an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza"".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: ""This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews.""

Boulder is a university city of about 105,000 people on the northwest edge of Denver, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

The attack follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC two weeks ago.

BOULDER, Co. -- A suspect carried out an ""act of terrorism"" on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon, using what police are describing as a ""makeshift flamethrower"" against a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators.

Six people were hospitalized with burns, including one who was seriously injured. The victims' ages ranged from 67 to 88, and they were all taken to local hospitals, police said.

The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" while using a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and throwing an incendiary device at the crowd, according to Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek.

Soliman was taken into custody without incident and transferred to a hospital where he was examined, police said.

FBI Director Kash Patel said officials were investigating the incident as a ""targeted terror attack."" The FBI believes the attack was ""ideologically motivated violence,"" according to ""early information, the evidence and witness accounts,"" Deputy Director Dan Bongino added.

The attack in Boulder comes at a time of heightened violence, including high-profile incidents against the Jewish community.

The pro-Israel demonstration was a Run for Their Lives walk, aiming to raise awareness about the remaining hostages in Gaza. The organization hosts global run and walk events, ""calling for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas,"" according to its website.

Leo Terrell, head of the antisemitism task force at the Justice Department, said that an ""incendiary device"" was thrown at participants in the walk.

""This was not an isolated incident,"" Terrell continued. ""This antisemitic terrorist attack is part of a horrific and escalating wave of violence targeting Jews and their supporters simply for being Jewish or standing up for Jewish lives,"" he said.

The attack happened on the eve of a Jewish holiday, Shavuot, ""making it all the more chilling and cruel,"" Terrell said.

A spokesperson for the organization, Miri Kornfeld, said in a statement to ABC News said a man who was leading the walk described the scene as ""the floor burning beneath them.""

President Donald Trump has been briefed on the ""targeted terror attack,"" a senior White House official told ABC News.

""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation,"" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis wrote on X, describing the incident as a ""heinous act of terror.""

Boulder Police, while calling the attack a ""tragedy"" and ""unacceptable,"" initially stopped short of calling the incident terrorism and did not want to speculate on the suspect's move, according to Chief Stephen Redfearn.

The incident occurred just before 1:30 p.m. on Sunday at the intersection of 13th Street and Pearl Street.

Police responded to reports of a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire.

When they arrived, there were multiple victims at the scene with injuries consistent with burns, police said. Police said four of the victims were taken to Boulder Community Hospital and two others were airlifted to a burn unit in Aurora. Apart from the victim with serious injuries, the others were believed to be more minor, Redfearn said.

Last month, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot and killed in Washington, D.C. in what was labeled as an ""act of terror.""

The shooting sparked outrage and has been condemned as an ""unspeakable"" act of antisemitism after officials said the suspect, who is in custody, shouted ""free, free Palestine"" following the shooting.

In April, the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, was targeted by an arsonist who allegedly made two Molotov cocktails from Heineken bottles he had at home and threw them inside the governor's mansion after breaking a window with a hammer, according to court documents.

The attack happened after the governor had posted about celebrating Passover with his family.

Chicago-area Rabbi Jeffrey Weill said it's difficult to comprehend another violent attack on the Jewish community.

""To have American citizens being attacked so brutally for exercising right of free speech, raising awareness of the hostages, tragically horrific situation, that's what we have to stand up against,"" Weill said.

He said it's even more painful to see the attack happen on the eve of a Jewish holiday.

""Shavuot, the holiday that celebrates the giving of the Torah to Mt. Sinai,"" Weill said. ""Jewish people were given the mandate the mission to be a light onto the nations, to bring light onto the world, to right injustice, and really that's what these people in Boulder were trying to do.""

It occurred more than a week after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington by a Chicago man who yelled ""I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza” as he was being led away by police.

FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department — which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations — decried the attack as a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.""

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Several people were injured and some may have been set on fire at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said. Police said a man was taken into custody in the attack that the FBI immediately described as a “targeted terror attack.""

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters Sunday evening that it was too early to discuss a motive but that witnesses were being interviewed.

“It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on,” he said.

The attack took place at a pedestrian mall where demonstrators had gathered to call for the release of hostages who remain in Gaza.

“Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,” FBI Director Kash Patel posted on social media.

Boulder police said there were “several victims” in the attack. The injuries authorities found were consistent with reports of individuals being set on fire, Redfearn said.

Several blocks of the typically popular pedestrian mall area were evacuated, police said.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation, adding that “hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”

The Boulder attack occurred as law enforcement authorities in the U.S. grapple with a sharp spike in antisemitic violence and just over a week after a man was arrested on charges in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers and shouted “Free Palestine” as he was being led away by police.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Law enforcement and FBI agents were responding on Sunday to what the FBI described as a “targeted terror attack” in Boulder, Colorado.

“Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,” FBI Director Kash Patel posted on social media.

Boulder Police said they were evacuating several blocks of the typically popular pedestrian mall area, saying that there were “several victims” in the attack without providing further details.

(AP) — A man with a makeshift flamethrower yelled “Free Palestine” and hurled an incendiary device into a group that had assembled to raise attention for Israeli hostages in Gaza, law enforcement officials said Sunday. Eight people were injured, some with burns.

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was booked into the Boulder County jail north of Denver and expected to face charges in connection with the attack the FBI was investigating as a terrorist act. Online records did not immediately show when he would make a court appearance.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said.

Across the U.S., the New York Police Department said it has upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

As people tried to help the woman on the ground, another woman who appeared to be a participant in the event yelled to others out of the camera’s view, defending their cause, saying they don’t talk about the government but just talk about the hostages.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then ""two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Segal, who said she is Jewish on her father’s side and has supported Palestine for more than 40 years, was concerned that she might be accused of helping the suspect because she was wearing a pro-Palestine shirt.

“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” she said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.""

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

This story has been updated to correct that 10 people, not four, were killed in the Boulder grocery store shooting.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

As people tried to help the woman on the ground, another woman who appeared to be a participant in the event yelled to others out of the camera’s view, defending their cause, saying they don’t talk about the government but just talk about the hostages.

Segal, who said she is Jewish on her father’s side and has supported the Palestinian cause for more than 40 years, was concerned that she might be accused of helping the suspect because she was wearing a pro-Palestinian shirt.

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",The attack took place at a popular pedestrian mall in Boulder and one person is in custody.

A group of people in Boulder, Colorado, were holding a regular demonstration to raise awareness of Hamas-held hostages in Gaza when they were allegedly targeted by a man who shouted ""Free Palestine"" on Sunday.

The suspect, who police named as 45-year-old Mohamd Sabry Soliman, was arrested at the scene.

Earlier on Monday, Soliman - from El Paso County in Colorado - was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Boulder Police in Colorado have since confirmed on X that no victims have died.

Four women and four men aged between 52 and 88 were injured and taken to hospitals, Boulder police said.

The force said the injuries ranged from ""very serious"" to ""more minor"".

Some of the victims were airlifted to the hospital.

Authorities had earlier put the number of injured at six and said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

The FBI says the attack was a targeted ""act of terrorism"".

Soliman was also taken to hospital after the alleged attack.

Eyewitnesses said the suspect threw Molotov cocktails, an improvised bomb made from a bottle filled with petrol and stuffed with a piece of cloth to use as a fuse, into people attending the demonstration.

He also used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" during the attack, according to Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office.

Two senior law enforcement officials told Sky News' US partner network that Soliman is an Egyptian national who seemingly acted alone. They said he has no previous significant contact with law enforcement.

The White House described the suspect as an ""illegal alien"" who had received a work permit under the Biden administration despite overstaying a tourist visa.

A large part of downtown Boulder was cordoned off as sniffer dogs and the bomb squad searched for potential devices.

Police chief Steve Redfearn said the attack happened around 1.26pm local time on Sunday and that initial reports were that ""people were being set on fire"".

""When we arrived we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns,"" Mr Redfearn told the media.

The police chief also said he did not believe anyone else was involved.

""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

Boulder's police chief said the attack happened as a ""group of pro-Israel people"" were peacefully demonstrating.

The walk is held regularly by a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives, which aims to raise awareness of the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Video from the scene showed a bare-chested man shouting and clutching two bottles after the attack.

Other footage showed him being held down and arrested by police as people doused one of the victims with water.

Nearby, there appeared to be a large black burn mark on the ground.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old student, described seeing four women on the ground with burns on their legs. She said one appeared badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass

bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

""Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water,'"" Ms Coffman said.

Lady on fire 'from head to toe'

Another eyewitness, who did not give his name, said: ""It was very strange to just hear a crash on the ground of a bottle breaking and then it sounded like a boom and then people started yelling and screaming.

""But I saw fire, I saw people screaming and crying and tripping and I saw the attacker - he had three Molotov cocktails.

""One of them he threw inside a group and one lady lit on fire from head to toe and then the other four people were also injured in the fire, but not as bad as the first one.""

The eyewitness continued: ""The attacker came out from the bushes and the trees... he threw another cocktail, and on the second one he lit himself on fire - I imagine accidentally.

""He seemed to have a bulletproof vest on, or some kind of vest, and then a shirt underneath it.

""And after he lit himself on fire he took off the vest and the shirt and he was shirtless.

""But he still had his Molotov cocktails in his hands ready to use them... ready to throw them and explode them on people.""

Lynn Segal, another eyewitness, said: ""These shoots of fire, linear, about 20 feet long, spears of fire, two of them at least, came across right into the group, about 15 feet from me.""

The 72-year-old said two neighbours of hers, a husband and wife in their 80s, were at the demonstration. She added that the wife was one of the victims and appeared to be the most seriously injured.

""They're both elders in their 80s, and you can't take something like this assault to your body as easily as someone younger.""

A statement from Boulder's Jewish community said ""an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza"".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: ""This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews.""

Boulder is a university city of about 105,000 people on the northwest edge of Denver, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

The attack follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC two weeks ago.

Political leaders condemned an alleged ""terror attack"" in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday, after a male suspect allegedly threw bottles of flammable liquid at people.

""My thoughts are with the victims of the horrifying terror attack that occurred this afternoon in Boulder. Hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado,"" Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""I will remain in contact with local officials as new information becomes available.""

Meanwhile, a senior White House official told Newsweek that President Donald Trump ""has been briefed"" on the attack.

The FBI quickly said the attack in Boulder was being investigated as terrorism on Sunday, although local police initially said they had not yet made that determination. The attack reportedly came as peaceful demonstrators protested in support of freeing Israeli hostages who continue to be held by Hamas amid the ongoing war in Gaza.

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war was sparked by an October 7, 2023, attack led by Hamas and allied Palestinian factions against Israel, resulting in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the abduction of 251. Today, around 58 people, fewer than half of whom are believed to still be alive, remain captive in Gaza. Over 54,000 people have died in Gaza, according to the Hamas-led Palestinian Health Ministry in the war-torn territory amid Israel's subsequent military campaign.

The area where Sunday's attack occurred, known as Pearl Street Mall, attracts visitors and locals with its shops and restaurants. It is also the site of many local performances and demonstrations.

What To Know

Several people are injured after the attack, according to local law enforcement. The extent of the injuries have not been confirmed, but local law enforcement said they ranged from minor to more severe, and that the suspect was injured as well.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said Sunday that it is investigating a ""targeted terror attack"" in Boulder, according to FBI Director Kash Patel in a post on X.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,"" he wrote.

Deputy FBI director Dan Bongino also posted to X, saying the attack was being probed as an ""act of terror.""

""All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation. If you have any investigative tips please contact the FBI. And if you aided or abetted this attack, we will find you. You cannot hide,"" Bongino wrote.

Local law enforcement said during a Sunday afternoon press conference that the scene was contained and that a suspect was in custody. They did not release the individual's identity or share information about a motive. While they noted that they'd been in touch with the FBI, they said they had not yet determined it was a terrorism.

However, at a later press conference on Sunday, FBI Special Agent McCullough said that the agency had determined based on preliminary facts that Soliman carried out a ""targeted attack"" and that the agency would investigate the attack as an act of terrorism.

The FBI told reporters they had identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, adding that he was heard shouting ""Free Palestine"" during the attack. Boulder Police believe there is no other suspect at large and that they have the sole suspect in custody.

Images from the scene of the attack showed an Israeli flag on the ground. The organization Run for Their Lives, which demonstrates peacefully for Israeli hostages held by Hamas, was holding an event in the location when the attack occurred.

What Political Leaders Are Saying

Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, wrote on X: ""As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less. Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.""

Representative Jeff Crank, a Colorado Republican, on X: ""Sickened by the targeted terror attack in Boulder this afternoon. We are closely monitoring the attack and praying for the victims and first responders on the scene.""

Representative Gabe Evans, a Colorado Republican, on X: ""My team is monitoring the attack of terror just outside our district in Boulder. Hate has no home in Colorado. We are praying for all those affected. Thank you law enforcement for quickly responding to the scene. Please follow their updates as more information is released.""

Representative Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, on X: ""We are closely monitoring, and are in contact with local law enforcement regarding the horrific attack on Pearl Street Mall. Praying hard for the victims.""

Denver Mayor Mike Johnston on X: ""Our hearts are with Boulder as we mourn the innocent victims of senseless violence. Denver Police Department is in contact with Boulder PD to provide any support they need. Hate has no place in Colorado.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on X: ""I'm closely monitoring the situation in Boulder. This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.""

Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, on X: ""I am heartbroken watching the footage of the horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado. A peaceful group of pro-Israel demonstrators holding a vigil for the hostages was reportedly attacked and set fire with Molotov cocktails by pro-Palestinian terrorists. This appears to be yet another act of antisemitic terrorism on U.S. soil. I'm praying for the victims and will continue demanding that the criminals responsible are brought to justice.""

What Happens Next

Authorities have yet to release more details about the victims and the suspect taken into custody. An alleged motive for the attack will likely be determined and announced by law enforcement later today or tomorrow.

BOULDER, Co. -- A suspect carried out an ""act of terrorism"" on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon, using what police are describing as a ""makeshift flamethrower"" against a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators.

Six people were hospitalized with burns, including one who was seriously injured. The victims' ages ranged from 67 to 88, and they were all taken to local hospitals, police said.

The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" while using a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and throwing an incendiary device at the crowd, according to Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek.

Soliman was taken into custody without incident and transferred to a hospital where he was examined, police said.

FBI Director Kash Patel said officials were investigating the incident as a ""targeted terror attack."" The FBI believes the attack was ""ideologically motivated violence,"" according to ""early information, the evidence and witness accounts,"" Deputy Director Dan Bongino added.

The attack in Boulder comes at a time of heightened violence, including high-profile incidents against the Jewish community.

The pro-Israel demonstration was a Run for Their Lives walk, aiming to raise awareness about the remaining hostages in Gaza. The organization hosts global run and walk events, ""calling for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas,"" according to its website.

Leo Terrell, head of the antisemitism task force at the Justice Department, said that an ""incendiary device"" was thrown at participants in the walk.

""This was not an isolated incident,"" Terrell continued. ""This antisemitic terrorist attack is part of a horrific and escalating wave of violence targeting Jews and their supporters simply for being Jewish or standing up for Jewish lives,"" he said.

The attack happened on the eve of a Jewish holiday, Shavuot, ""making it all the more chilling and cruel,"" Terrell said.

A spokesperson for the organization, Miri Kornfeld, said in a statement to ABC News said a man who was leading the walk described the scene as ""the floor burning beneath them.""

""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation,"" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis wrote on X, describing the incident as a ""heinous act of terror.""

Boulder Police, while calling the attack a ""tragedy"" and ""unacceptable,"" initially stopped short of calling the incident terrorism and did not want to speculate on the suspect's move, according to Chief Stephen Redfearn.

The incident occurred just before 1:30 p.m. on Sunday at the intersection of 13th Street and Pearl Street.

Police responded to reports of a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire.

When they arrived, there were multiple victims at the scene with injuries consistent with burns, police said. Police said four of the victims were taken to Boulder Community Hospital and two others were airlifted to a burn unit in Aurora. Apart from the victim with serious injuries, the others were believed to be more minor, Redfearn said.

Last month, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot and killed in Washington, D.C. in what was labeled as an ""act of terror.""

The shooting sparked outrage and has been condemned as an ""unspeakable"" act of antisemitism after officials said the suspect, who is in custody, shouted ""free, free Palestine"" following the shooting.

In April, the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, was targeted by an arsonist who allegedly made two Molotov cocktails from Heineken bottles he had at home and threw them inside the governor's mansion after breaking a window with a hammer, according to court documents.

The attack happened after the governor had posted about celebrating Passover with his family.

Chicago-area Rabbi Jeffrey Weill said it's difficult to comprehend another violent attack on the Jewish community.

""To have American citizens being attacked so brutally for exercising right of free speech, raising awareness of the hostages, tragically horrific situation, that's what we have to stand up against,"" Weill said.

He said it's even more painful to see the attack happen on the eve of a Jewish holiday.

""Shavuot, the holiday that celebrates the giving of the Torah to Mt. Sinai,"" Weill said. ""Jewish people were given the mandate the mission to be a light onto the nations, to bring light onto the world, to right injustice, and really that's what these people in Boulder were trying to do.""

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Michalek said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organised by Run for Their Lives, an organisation devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law"".

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the US over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in anti-Semitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel led by President Donald Trump to brand pro-Palestinian protests as anti-Semitic.

Here’s what we know,"A man yelling “Free Palestine!” used incendiary devices and a makeshift flamethrower to attack people calling for the release of Israeli hostages Sunday in Colorado, in what authorities are calling a targeted antisemitic attack.

Witnesses described seeing huge flames and people pouring buckets of water onto burning victims. At least 12 people were injured, including four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, authorities said. Two victims were airlifted to the Denver metro area. At least one victim was “very seriously injured,” officials said.

No victims have died, the Boulder Police Department said Monday morning.

The FBI is investigating the attack as “an act of terrorism,” the agency said. It happened at a weekly walk in support of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Among the victims is a Holocaust survivor, according to a person who knows the victim and was at the event. It is unclear what their condition is.

The suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is charged with a federal hate crime, according to an affidavit filed Sunday. He’s also facing a number of state charges, including 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder; two counts of use of an incendiary device; 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device; and eight counts of first-degree assault.

He was previously booked on two counts of first-degree murder.

Soliman faces life in prison if convicted of the federal charge, acting United States Attorney for the District of Colorado J. Bishop Grewell said Monday. And he could face 384 years in state prison if convicted of the 16 attempted murder counts, according to Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

Authorities recovered 16 unused Molotov cocktails after the incident, Dougherty said Monday.

Soliman made his first court appearance Monday in Colorado District Court and is scheduled to return Thursday afternoon for the filing of charges. He is being held on a $10 million cash bond, the judge said.

Soliman, who appeared on camera in an orange jumpsuit from Boulder County Jail, didn’t enter a plea at Monday’s hearing.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the department will hold the perpetrator “accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”

In videos obtained by CNN, Soliman, 45, is seen shirtless, yelling “Palestine is free!” “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” He carries two bottles, and witnesses can be heard saying he’s “spraying alcohol” and “he’s making Molotov cocktails.”

Soliman threw two Molotov cocktails before he was arrested, the federal affidavit said. He arrived in the area around 1 p.m. wearing a utility vest over his shirt and carrying a garden sprayer filled with gasoline. Many witnesses said he looked like a gardener, officials said.

During an interview, Soliman told local and federal agents he had researched on YouTube how to make Molotov cocktails and bought the ingredients and constructed the incendiary devices, federal charging documents say.

Police also found a “backpack weed sprayer,” which, along with glass bottles, was determined to be filled with gasoline commonly found at gas stations as well as xylene, a colorless, highly flammable and sweet-smelling liquid, according to the federal court documents.

Officials are working to assess whether the alleged attacker has any possible mental health issues, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Law enforcement visited Soliman’s home in Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder, the affidavit said.

Sunday’s attack came less than two weeks after two young Israeli Embassy staffers were fatally shot in Washington, DC, by a man who claimed to have been acting “for Gaza.”

“The Jewish community has been warning the world that chants of ‘globalize the Intifada’ and ‘resistance by any means necessary’ are calls to violence. We’ve now seen that violence erupt in America twice in less than two weeks,” Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.

Here’s what else we know about the Boulder attack.

Sunday’s attack took place on the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, where a weekly “Run for Their Lives” event was being held. The event, which has taken place regularly since mid-October 2023, aims to raise awareness of Israeli hostages being held captive by Hamas and calls for their release.

“This global grass roots organization was founded on October 15, 2023, a week after the horrendous terrorist attack by Hamas. … These walks have been held every week since then for all the hostages – without any violent incidents until today,” the organization said in a statement.

Soliman targeted the group after researching them online. He knew about their meeting Sunday and was planning to conduct the attack for a year but was waiting on his daughter to graduate, according to the affidavit.

Witness Brian Horwitz told CNN he and his family were dining at a food hall near the scene when a woman ran toward them saying a man was “throwing fire” at people.

Horwitz got up and ran into the courtyard, where he saw a man carrying a tank on his back that resembled a gardening chemical sprayer.

Another man was trying to talk the suspect down, but the suspect kept yelling, “f**k you, Zionist,” “you all deserve to die,” and “you’ve killed these children.”

After calling 911, Horwitz went to see whether he could assist any victims. He described seeing an elderly woman lying on the ground, unresponsive.

“There were several people attending to her and wrapping her up, trying to ensure she was OK,” he said. People from a restaurant across the street were bringing large buckets of ice water to help extinguish the flames, he added.

He grabbed a bucket and filled it with water from a fountain in the middle of the courtyard, he said. “I just kept filling that up and pouring it on their legs.”

“Their pants were completely burned and singed off. It looked like their skin had just melted off their bodies.”

Many of the victims are well known in the community, said Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel. She talked to a couple of them, including one woman who is “healing from horrible burns.”

“She really felt like this happened not just to her, but to the whole community,” Funk said. A mother and daughter were also wounded in the attack, she said.

The mother “is a Holocaust survivor in her 80s who’s been through certainly enough trauma,” she added.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

Six of the injured are members of the Congregation Bonai Shalom in Boulder, according to CNN affiliate KUSA. Four of them were hospitalized and discharged, while two were airlifted to a hospital near Denver, the congregation’s leader, Rabbi Marc Soloway, told KUSA.

One person remains in serious condition, Soloway said.

“Tragically, the person who was most seriously injured, it was their first time going on the walk,” the rabbi said.

The congregation, which Soloway said is “like a big family,” is struggling to process a range of emotions in the aftermath of the attack.

“We’re all just feeling broken and angry and grieving and sad and hopeless,” Soloway said.

Videos obtained by CNN capture Soliman, shirtless, on a patch of grass near an area that has obvious burn marks. Around him are black clouds of smoke.

Witnesses said Soliman took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack, according to police. He was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for treatment of burns he sustained to his hands during the attack.

In an interview with law enforcement after his arrest, Soliman “stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead. Soliman stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again,” the affidavit read.

Soliman “planned on dying” in the attack, according to a warrant for his arrest. He said he threw two Molotov cocktails only because he “got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” according to the warrant, and “he would not forgive himself if he did not do it.”

No one else knew about his plan, Soliman said, according to the warrant.

Soliman had taken a concealed-carry class and learned to shoot a gun, but he was unable to purchase one because he was not a legal citizen, the warrant said.

As of Sunday, the FBI had been working to determine whether Soliman may have been suffering from mental health concerns, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.

Soliman arrived in the United States in August 2022 on a non-immigrant B2 visa that expired the following February, according to Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.

Soliman is an Egyptian national, according to law enforcement sources.

He filed for asylum in September 2022, McLaughlin said on X.

Soliman was granted a work authorization in March 2023, multiple law enforcement officials said. The authorization expired at the end of March 2025, at which point it appears he remained here illegally, the officials added.

Law enforcement sources previously told CNN the suspect had applied for asylum and been rejected for a visa in 2005.

Jewish leaders on high alert after second antisemitic attack in two weeks

“Today, six people were set on fire by a terrorist in Boulder, Colorado. Why? Because they were calling for 58 hostages still held by Hamas terrorists to finally be returned home,” Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.

The Boulder attack was part of a “wave of domestic terror attacks aimed at the Jewish community,” said Eric D. Fingerhut, the president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. Fingerhut outlined a six-point plan for the federal government to address the growing threat.

His proposals included increasing a non-profit security grant program funding to $1 billion to meet urgent needs, dedicating resources for security personnel at Jewish institutions, bolstering FBI intelligence capabilities to thwart domestic terrorism and holding social media platforms accountable for spreading antisemitic hate and incitement, among others.

The Boulder Police Department will increase the number of officers at community events in the next seven to 10 days, Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said Monday.

“We want to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in this community gathering, and remembering what happened, as well as any other planned events that we have,” he said.

Rabbi Soloway of the heavily impacted Congregation Bonai Shalom says all services at their synagogue now require armed security.

“It is just inconceivable that Jewish people in the United States of America in 2025 can feel so unsafe right now,” Soloway told KUSA.

In response to Sunday’s attack, authorities in major cities across the US have deployed extra security at Jewish sites and community centers.

On Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced in a statement an emergency meeting will be held in City Hall to address heightened security ahead of the Jewish holiday Shavuot, and the Los Angeles Police Department would be conducting “extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers” throughout the city.

“Antisemitism will not be tolerated,” she said.

On the East Coast, the New York Police Department said its presence has increased at synagogues and other religious ﻿sites across the city for Shavuot.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested after victims were attacked near Pearl Street in Boulder around 2 p.m. local time on Sunday, police said. The FBI considers the incident a ""targeted act of violence” and is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism.

He allegedly used a “makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device” into the crowd as he shouted “Free Palestine,” FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek told reporters.

Six people, ranging from 67 to 88 years old, were injured. One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor. Their conditions range from minor to critical, police said. Some of the wounds were consistent with burns.

Witnesses told CBS News that they witnessed someone attacking the peaceful demonstrators with Molotov cocktails.

“Every, every one of the victims I could tell that I saw had skin basically melted or hanging from their, from their legs,” a witness told Fox Denver.

Former FBI agent Bobby Chacon told CNN that because Molotov cocktails can be made from essentially household items, it’s unlikely that buying the components would have put the suspect on law enforcement radar.

The suspect is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in March 2025, Trump administration sources told Fox News.

He arrived in the US in August 2022 at Los Angeles International Airport. His last visa was approved for renewal in March 2023.

A senior White House official told The Independent that the president has been briefed on the situation.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien. He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a post on X.

Ed Victor, who was one of about 30 people participating in the march on Sunday, told CBS News that the group was peacefully walking down Pearl Street when the attack occurred.

""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side... And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown,” Victor told the outlet. Another marcher “saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire.”

Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse said he’s “praying hard” for the victims. “We are closely monitoring, and are in contact with local law enforcement regarding the horrific attack on Pearl Street Mall. Praying hard for the victims,” he wrote on X.

The state’s Democratic Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack. “My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation,” he wrote in a statement.

Colorado Senators John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennett both denounced the attack, each saying there was no place for hate in their home state.

The Boulder Jewish Community issued a joint statement in the wake of the attack. ""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed,” the statement read. ""Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.”

The statement continued: “When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another. Strength to you all.”

The Anti-Defamation League also issued a statement, saying it’s aware of the reports of the attack at Boulder Run for Their Lives event, which the nonprofit described as “a weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages kidnapped on 10/7.”","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested after six victims aged 67 to 88 were attacked in Boulder"

FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X that the bureau was “fully investigating” what he described as a “targeted terror attack” in Boulder on Sunday, while FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said they were probing the incident as an “act of terror, and targeted violence” while asking for anyone with information to contact the bureau.

One person was arrested after throwing a Molotov cocktail towards the pro-Israel demonstrators, according to Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn. Speaking to reporters from the scene of the attack, Redfearn said authorities were called to the area responding to calls “that people were being set on fire” by “a man with a weapon.”

Redfearn also said that victims, attendees of the weekly Boulder Run for Their Lives event calling for the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, had “injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,” though he could not provide an estimate for the number of individuals who were harmed in the attack.

He warned that some of those injuries could be life threatening. At a Sunday evening press conference, Redfearn said the victims ranged in age from 67 to 88 years old, “at least one” of whom “was very seriously injured, probably safe to say, [in] critical condition.” The 88 year old victim fled Nazi persecution in Europe, Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado.

At a press conference Sunday, FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman. Fox News reported that Soliman is an “Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally as a visa overstay who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration,” citing senior Department of Homeland Security officials.

Soliman arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a visa that expired in February 2023, filing a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in September 2022 for a work visa that was approved for a two-year period in March 2023. He remained in the U.S. illegally despite his work authorization expiring in March of this year.

Videos circulating on social media of the attack showed Soliman shouting “end Zionists.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a post on X that he was “closely monitoring the situation in Boulder” and said that his state was working “with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

In a second statement on his personal account, Polis wrote that, “As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less.”

“Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims,” he continued.

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), who is running to replace the term-limited Polis, described the incident as a “horrifying terror attack” in a statement posted to X. “My thoughts are with the victims of the horrifying terror attack that occurred this afternoon in Boulder. Hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado,” Bennet wrote.

Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) wrote on the platform that, “Hate of any kind has no home in Colorado. We’re monitoring the reports of a horrific terror attack in Boulder this afternoon. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) also said that he was “closely monitoring the situation in Boulder,” adding, “This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.”

A White House official said late Sunday that President Donald Trump “has been briefed” on the attack.

The attack comes less than two weeks after the murder of two Israeli Embassy staffers attending an American Jewish Committee event in Washington. The alleged shooter yelled “Free Palestine” shortly after committing the crime.

In April, during the first night of Passover, an arsonist tried to burn down Gov. Josh Shapiro’s residence. The perpetrator cited the governor’s support for Israel as his motive.","One person has been arrested after throwing a Molotov cocktail towards demonstrators, injuring multiple victims"

An eyewitness account posted by a pro-Israel X user said that most of the victims were in their 70s. Video from the scene shared on social media showed smoke and people on the ground. Screaming was audible. Another video showed a shirtless man, holding spray bottles, yelling, “End Zionists.”

An adult male suspect was arrested but police declined to name him or speculate on his motive in the hours after the incident. Without offering details, FBI Director Kash Patel posted that his agency was investigating what he said was a “targeted terror attack.”

The incident took place shortly after 1 p.m. on the Pearl Street Mall in downtown Boulder, which hosts the city’s Run for Our Lives. The weekly walks are held in communities around the world to sustain attention to the hostages being held by Hamas.

It comes 10 days after a pro-Palestinian activist shot and killed two attendees of an event held at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.

“We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Our Lives walk on Pearl Street,” local Jewish leaders, including rabbis, said in a statement distributed by the Boulder Jewish Community Center. They added, “Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.”

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a press conference that the initial emergency call had said people were being set on fire and that multiple people had been transported to hospitals with injuries “fairly consistent” with that description. He said the injuries ranged from minor to severe and potentially life-threatening.

Redfearn confirmed that “a group of pro-Israel people” had been gathered in the area but said it was too early yet to say whether they had been targeted. He said that if an investigation shows that any group was targeted, the police department would seek to safeguard them in the future.

“I cannot confirm right now that this was targeted at a specific group of people,” he said. “We understand that there’s a lot of tensions right now and a lot of issues in the United States and everywhere.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested after victims were attacked near Pearl Street in Boulder around 2 p.m. local time on Sunday, police said. The FBI considers the incident a ""targeted act of violence” and is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism.

He allegedly used a “makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device” into the crowd as he shouted “Free Palestine,” FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek told reporters.

Six people, ranging from 67 to 88 years old, were injured. One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor. Their conditions range from minor to critical, police said. Some of the wounds were consistent with burns.

Witnesses told CBS News that they witnessed someone attacking the peaceful demonstrators with Molotov cocktails.

“Every, every one of the victims I could tell that I saw had skin basically melted or hanging from their, from their legs,” a witness told Fox Denver.

Former FBI agent Bobby Chacon told CNN that because Molotov cocktails can be made from essentially household items, it’s unlikely that buying the components would have put the suspect on law enforcement radar.

The suspect is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in March 2025, Trump administration sources told Fox News.

He arrived in the US in August 2022 at Los Angeles International Airport. His last visa was approved for renewal in March 2023.

A senior White House official told The Independent that the president has been briefed on the situation.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien. He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a post on X.

Ed Victor, who was one of about 30 people participating in the march on Sunday, told CBS News that the group was peacefully walking down Pearl Street when the attack occurred.

""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side... And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown,” Victor told the outlet. Another marcher “saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire.”

Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse said he’s “praying hard” for the victims. “We are closely monitoring, and are in contact with local law enforcement regarding the horrific attack on Pearl Street Mall. Praying hard for the victims,” he wrote on X.

The state’s Democratic Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack. “My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation,” he wrote in a statement.

Colorado Senators John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennett both denounced the attack, each saying there was no place for hate in their home state.

The Boulder Jewish Community issued a joint statement in the wake of the attack. ""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed,” the statement read. ""Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.”

The statement continued: “When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another. Strength to you all.”

The Anti-Defamation League also issued a statement, saying it’s aware of the reports of the attack at Boulder Run for Their Lives event, which the nonprofit described as “a weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages kidnapped on 10/7.”","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested after six victims aged 67 to 88 were attacked in Boulder"

Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Michalek said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organised by Run for Their Lives, an organisation devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law"".

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the US over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in anti-Semitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel led by President Donald Trump to brand pro-Palestinian protests as anti-Semitic.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs.

One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.","A man using a makeshift flamethrower yelled ""Free Palestine"" after attacking people staging a demonstration calling for the..."

Here’s what we know,"A man yelling “Free Palestine!” used incendiary devices and a makeshift flamethrower to attack people calling for the release of Israeli hostages Sunday in Colorado, in what authorities are calling a targeted antisemitic attack.

Witnesses described seeing huge flames and people pouring buckets of water onto burning victims. At least 12 people were injured, including four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, authorities said. Two victims were airlifted to the Denver metro area. At least one victim was “very seriously injured,” officials said.

No victims have died, the Boulder Police Department said Monday morning.

The FBI is investigating the attack as “an act of terrorism,” the agency said. It happened at a weekly walk in support of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Among the victims is a Holocaust survivor, according to a person who knows the victim and was at the event. It is unclear what their condition is.

The suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is charged with a federal hate crime, according to an affidavit filed Sunday. He’s also facing a number of state charges, including 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder; two counts of use of an incendiary device; 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device; and eight counts of first-degree assault.

He was previously booked on two counts of first-degree murder.

Soliman faces life in prison if convicted of the federal charge, acting United States Attorney for the District of Colorado J. Bishop Grewell said Monday. And he could face 384 years in state prison if convicted of the 16 attempted murder counts, according to Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

Authorities recovered 16 unused Molotov cocktails after the incident, Dougherty said Monday.

Soliman made his first court appearance Monday in Colorado District Court and is scheduled to return Thursday afternoon for the filing of charges. He is being held on a $10 million cash bond, the judge said.

Soliman, who appeared on camera in an orange jumpsuit from Boulder County Jail, didn’t enter a plea at Monday’s hearing.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the department will hold the perpetrator “accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”

In videos obtained by CNN, Soliman, 45, is seen shirtless, yelling “Palestine is free!” “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” He carries two bottles, and witnesses can be heard saying he’s “spraying alcohol” and “he’s making Molotov cocktails.”

Soliman threw two Molotov cocktails before he was arrested, the federal affidavit said. He arrived in the area around 1 p.m. wearing a utility vest over his shirt and carrying a garden sprayer filled with gasoline. Many witnesses said he looked like a gardener, officials said.

During an interview, Soliman told local and federal agents he had researched on YouTube how to make Molotov cocktails and bought the ingredients and constructed the incendiary devices, federal charging documents say.

Police also found a “backpack weed sprayer,” which, along with glass bottles, was determined to be filled with gasoline commonly found at gas stations as well as xylene, a colorless, highly flammable and sweet-smelling liquid, according to the federal court documents.

Officials are working to assess whether the alleged attacker has any possible mental health issues, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Law enforcement visited Soliman’s home in Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder, the affidavit said.

Sunday’s attack came less than two weeks after two young Israeli Embassy staffers were fatally shot in Washington, DC, by a man who claimed to have been acting “for Gaza.”

“The Jewish community has been warning the world that chants of ‘globalize the Intifada’ and ‘resistance by any means necessary’ are calls to violence. We’ve now seen that violence erupt in America twice in less than two weeks,” Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.

Here’s what else we know about the Boulder attack.

Sunday’s attack took place on the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, where a weekly “Run for Their Lives” event was being held. The event, which has taken place regularly since mid-October 2023, aims to raise awareness of Israeli hostages being held captive by Hamas and calls for their release.

“This global grass roots organization was founded on October 15, 2023, a week after the horrendous terrorist attack by Hamas. … These walks have been held every week since then for all the hostages – without any violent incidents until today,” the organization said in a statement.

Soliman targeted the group after researching them online. He knew about their meeting Sunday and was planning to conduct the attack for a year but was waiting on his daughter to graduate, according to the affidavit.

Witness Brian Horwitz told CNN he and his family were dining at a food hall near the scene when a woman ran toward them saying a man was “throwing fire” at people.

Horwitz got up and ran into the courtyard, where he saw a man carrying a tank on his back that resembled a gardening chemical sprayer.

Another man was trying to talk the suspect down, but the suspect kept yelling, “f**k you, Zionist,” “you all deserve to die,” and “you’ve killed these children.”

After calling 911, Horwitz went to see whether he could assist any victims. He described seeing an elderly woman lying on the ground, unresponsive.

“There were several people attending to her and wrapping her up, trying to ensure she was OK,” he said. People from a restaurant across the street were bringing large buckets of ice water to help extinguish the flames, he added.

He grabbed a bucket and filled it with water from a fountain in the middle of the courtyard, he said. “I just kept filling that up and pouring it on their legs.”

“Their pants were completely burned and singed off. It looked like their skin had just melted off their bodies.”

Many of the victims are well known in the community, said Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel. She talked to a couple of them, including one woman who is “healing from horrible burns.”

“She really felt like this happened not just to her, but to the whole community,” Funk said. A mother and daughter were also wounded in the attack, she said.

The mother “is a Holocaust survivor in her 80s who’s been through certainly enough trauma,” she added.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

Six of the injured are members of the Congregation Bonai Shalom in Boulder, according to CNN affiliate KUSA. Four of them were hospitalized and discharged, while two were airlifted to a hospital near Denver, the congregation’s leader, Rabbi Marc Soloway, told KUSA.

One person remains in serious condition, Soloway said.

“Tragically, the person who was most seriously injured, it was their first time going on the walk,” the rabbi said.

The congregation, which Soloway said is “like a big family,” is struggling to process a range of emotions in the aftermath of the attack.

“We’re all just feeling broken and angry and grieving and sad and hopeless,” Soloway said.

Videos obtained by CNN capture Soliman, shirtless, on a patch of grass near an area that has obvious burn marks. Around him are black clouds of smoke.

Witnesses said Soliman took off his vest and shirt because they had started to catch fire during the attack, according to police. He was taken to an area hospital after his arrest for treatment of burns he sustained to his hands during the attack.

In an interview with law enforcement after his arrest, Soliman “stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead. Soliman stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again,” the affidavit read.

Soliman “planned on dying” in the attack, according to a warrant for his arrest. He said he threw two Molotov cocktails only because he “got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” according to the warrant, and “he would not forgive himself if he did not do it.”

No one else knew about his plan, Soliman said, according to the warrant.

Soliman had taken a concealed-carry class and learned to shoot a gun, but he was unable to purchase one because he was not a legal citizen, the warrant said.

As of Sunday, the FBI had been working to determine whether Soliman may have been suffering from mental health concerns, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.

Soliman arrived in the United States in August 2022 on a non-immigrant B2 visa that expired the following February, according to Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.

Soliman is an Egyptian national, according to law enforcement sources.

He filed for asylum in September 2022, McLaughlin said on X.

Soliman was granted a work authorization in March 2023, multiple law enforcement officials said. The authorization expired at the end of March 2025, at which point it appears he remained here illegally, the officials added.

Law enforcement sources previously told CNN the suspect had applied for asylum and been rejected for a visa in 2005.

Jewish leaders on high alert after second antisemitic attack in two weeks

“Today, six people were set on fire by a terrorist in Boulder, Colorado. Why? Because they were calling for 58 hostages still held by Hamas terrorists to finally be returned home,” Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.

The Boulder attack was part of a “wave of domestic terror attacks aimed at the Jewish community,” said Eric D. Fingerhut, the president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. Fingerhut outlined a six-point plan for the federal government to address the growing threat.

His proposals included increasing a non-profit security grant program funding to $1 billion to meet urgent needs, dedicating resources for security personnel at Jewish institutions, bolstering FBI intelligence capabilities to thwart domestic terrorism and holding social media platforms accountable for spreading antisemitic hate and incitement, among others.

The Boulder Police Department will increase the number of officers at community events in the next seven to 10 days, Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said Monday.

“We want to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in this community gathering, and remembering what happened, as well as any other planned events that we have,” he said.

Rabbi Soloway of the heavily impacted Congregation Bonai Shalom says all services at their synagogue now require armed security.

“It is just inconceivable that Jewish people in the United States of America in 2025 can feel so unsafe right now,” Soloway told KUSA.

In response to Sunday’s attack, authorities in major cities across the US have deployed extra security at Jewish sites and community centers.

On Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced in a statement an emergency meeting will be held in City Hall to address heightened security ahead of the Jewish holiday Shavuot, and the Los Angeles Police Department would be conducting “extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers” throughout the city.

“Antisemitism will not be tolerated,” she said.

On the East Coast, the New York Police Department said its presence has increased at synagogues and other religious ﻿sites across the city for Shavuot.

It comes 10 days after a pro-Palestinian activist shot and killed two attendees of an event held at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.

“We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Our Lives walk on Pearl Street,” local Jewish leaders, including rabbis, said in a statement distributed by the Boulder Jewish Community Center. They added, “Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.”

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a press conference that the initial emergency call had said people were being set on fire and that multiple people had been transported to hospitals with injuries “fairly consistent” with that description. He said the injuries ranged from minor to severe and potentially life-threatening.

Redfearn confirmed that “a group of pro-Israel people” had been gathered in the area but said it was too early yet to say whether they had been targeted. He said that if an investigation shows that any group was targeted, the police department would seek to safeguard them in the future.

“I cannot confirm right now that this was targeted at a specific group of people,” he said. “We understand that there’s a lot of tensions right now and a lot of issues in the United States and everywhere. Once we have a clear motive, we will react accordingly. And if that motive was a group that’s targeted, we will absolutely step up and ensure that additional security, additional presence.”

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested after victims were attacked near Pearl Street in Boulder around 2 p.m. local time on Sunday, police said. The FBI considers the incident a ""targeted act of violence” and is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism.

He allegedly used a “makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device” into the crowd as he shouted “Free Palestine,” FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek told reporters.

Six people, ranging from 67 to 88 years old, were injured. One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor. Their conditions range from minor to critical, police said. Some of the wounds were consistent with burns.

Witnesses told CBS News that they witnessed someone attacking the peaceful demonstrators with Molotov cocktails.

“Every, every one of the victims I could tell that I saw had skin basically melted or hanging from their, from their legs,” a witness told Fox Denver.

Former FBI agent Bobby Chacon told CNN that because Molotov cocktails can be made from essentially household items, it’s unlikely that buying the components would have put the suspect on law enforcement radar.

The suspect is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in March 2025, Trump administration sources told Fox News.

He arrived in the US in August 2022 at Los Angeles International Airport. His last visa was approved for renewal in March 2023.

A senior White House official told The Independent that the president has been briefed on the situation.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien. He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a post on X.

Ed Victor, who was one of about 30 people participating in the march on Sunday, told CBS News that the group was peacefully walking down Pearl Street when the attack occurred.

""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side... And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown,” Victor told the outlet. Another marcher “saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire.”

Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse said he’s “praying hard” for the victims. “We are closely monitoring, and are in contact with local law enforcement regarding the horrific attack on Pearl Street Mall. Praying hard for the victims,” he wrote on X.

The state’s Democratic Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack. “My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation,” he wrote in a statement.

Colorado Senators John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennett both denounced the attack, each saying there was no place for hate in their home state.

The Boulder Jewish Community issued a joint statement in the wake of the attack. ""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed,” the statement read. ""Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.”

The statement continued: “When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another. Strength to you all.”

The Anti-Defamation League also issued a statement, saying it’s aware of the reports of the attack at Boulder Run for Their Lives event, which the nonprofit described as “a weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages kidnapped on 10/7.”","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested after six victims aged 67 to 88 were attacked in Boulder"

FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X that the bureau was “fully investigating” what he described as a “targeted terror attack” in Boulder on Sunday, while FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said they were probing the incident as an “act of terror, and targeted violence” while asking for anyone with information to contact the bureau.

One person was arrested after throwing a Molotov cocktail towards the pro-Israel demonstrators, according to Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn. Speaking to reporters from the scene of the attack, Redfearn said authorities were called to the area responding to calls “that people were being set on fire” by “a man with a weapon.”

Redfearn also said that victims, attendees of the weekly Boulder Run for Their Lives event calling for the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, had “injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,” though he could not provide an estimate for the number of individuals who were harmed in the attack.

He warned that some of those injuries could be life threatening. At a Sunday evening press conference, Redfearn said the victims ranged in age from 67 to 88 years old, “at least one” of whom “was very seriously injured, probably safe to say, [in] critical condition.” The 88 year old victim fled Nazi persecution in Europe, Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado.

At a press conference Sunday, FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman. Fox News reported that Soliman is an “Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally as a visa overstay who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration,” citing senior Department of Homeland Security officials.

Soliman arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a visa that expired in February 2023, filing a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in September 2022 for a work visa that was approved for a two-year period in March 2023. He remained in the U.S. illegally despite his work authorization expiring in March of this year.

Videos circulating on social media of the attack showed Soliman shouting “end Zionists.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a post on X that he was “closely monitoring the situation in Boulder” and said that his state was working “with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

In a second statement on his personal account, Polis wrote that, “As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less.”

“Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims,” he continued.

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), who is running to replace the term-limited Polis, described the incident as a “horrifying terror attack” in a statement posted to X. “My thoughts are with the victims of the horrifying terror attack that occurred this afternoon in Boulder. Hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado,” Bennet wrote.

Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) wrote on the platform that, “Hate of any kind has no home in Colorado. We’re monitoring the reports of a horrific terror attack in Boulder this afternoon. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) also said that he was “closely monitoring the situation in Boulder,” adding, “This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.”

A White House official said late Sunday that President Donald Trump “has been briefed” on the attack.

The attack comes less than two weeks after the murder of two Israeli Embassy staffers attending an American Jewish Committee event in Washington. The alleged shooter yelled “Free Palestine” shortly after committing the crime.

In April, during the first night of Passover, an arsonist tried to burn down Gov. Josh Shapiro’s residence. The perpetrator cited the governor’s support for Israel as his motive.","One person has been arrested after throwing a Molotov cocktail towards demonstrators, injuring multiple victims"

(AP) — A man with a makeshift flamethrower yelled “Free Palestine” and threw an incendiary device into a group that had assembled to raise attention for Israeli hostages in Gaza, law enforcement officials said Sunday. Six people were injured, some with burns.

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was expected to face charges in connection with the attack the FBI was investigating as a terrorist act.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. It occurred barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The six victims who were wounded range in age from 67 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then “two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Segal, who said she is Jewish on her father’s side and has supported Palestine for more than 40 years, was concerned that she might be accused of helping the suspect because she was wearing a pro-Palestine shirt.

“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” she said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.”

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel’s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed four people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

Associated Press journalists Brittany Peterson and David Zalubowski in Boulder, Colorado, Kimberlee Kruesi in Providence, Rhode Island, Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, Alanna Durkin Richer and Michael Biesecker in Washington and Jim Mustian in New York contributed to this report.",A man with a flamethrower yelled “Free Palestine” and threw an incendiary device into a group raising attention for Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Witnesses said the suspect threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims, police and the FBI said. Boulder police initially said five people, then eight were injured; they raised the total to 12 on Monday afternoon and then 15 on Wednesday after officials said more people with less serious injuries came forward.

The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was ""clear this is a targeted act of violence"" and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.

Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts, including attempted murder, and a federal hate crimes charge.

Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, the Department of Homeland Security said. That original visa expired in February 2023, and he had applied for asylum. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.

The FBI said later Sunday night it was ""conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder"" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.

Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts and a federal hate crimes charge.

The walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also yelled ""End Zionist!"" during the attack.

Police said the victims included eight women and seven men, whose ages range from 25 to 88. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be ""safe to say"" that person was in critical condition.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a ""very loving person."" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.

The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.

UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.

Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.

Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday's event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said FBI agents were at the scene Sunday afternoon.

U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi released a statement Monday after the federal charge was filed. ""The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Our prayers are with the victims and our Jewish community across the world,"" she said.

Bondi added, ""This vile anti-Semitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC,"" referring to the fatal shooting of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21. ""We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.""

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media that the ""National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,"" according to the Reuters news agency.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a ""heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.""

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" Polis said. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Run for Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, ""This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release."" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk.

Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.

""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,"" said Victor.

Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.

""I saw the aftermath,"" said street performer Peter Irish. ""It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.""

University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, ""My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.""

We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed. Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured. We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon:","A suspect is in custody after what authorities call a ""targeted act of violence"" at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado. Witnesses said he threw Molotov cocktails at people supporting Israeli hostages."

The moment the alleged suspect in the 'targeted terror attack' in Boulder, Colorado was arrested has been caught on camera - he has since been taken into custody

Shocking footage capturing the moment the man suspected of the 'targeted terror attack' in Boulder, Colorado was arrested by police has been shared on social media.

The horrific incident occurred on Sunday afternoon just before 1:30p.m. at the intersection of 13th Street and Pearl Street. A group of people were participating in a pro-Israel demonstration when the attack happened.

Boulder Police evacuated several blocks of the typically popular pedestrian mall area, saying that there were 'several victims' in the attack. The attacker, who has not been formally identified, has been taken into custody.

Footage at the chaotic scene shows the moment when police apprehend the alleged suspect who appeared to have Molotov cocktails in both his hands.

After yelling at people at the scene the man immediately puts his hands up when police approach him with guns drawn and yell at him to get on the ground. He gets on the grass face down and is handcuffed by officers without seemingly resisting.

Eyewitnesses describe a shirtless male suspect throwing Molotov cocktails at the group on the intersection of 13th and Pearl Street in the northern Colorado city on Sunday afternoon, prompting response from local and state police as well as the FBI.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said several people were injured in the incident as some injuries were ""consistent with burns"". Those injuries ranged from ""very serious"" to more minor.

IIt is not yet known the amount of people injured from the attack. Redfearn said Boulder dispatch received several calls about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire.

Redfearn added that an unidentified suspect was pointed out to officers at the scene and taken into custody ""without incident"". He was taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries.

Prior to his arrest the same man was captured shouting ""Palestine is free"" as he continued to shout at and converse with bystanders at the scene. ""They are killers, how many children, how many children you killed?"" the shirtless man said. ""We can't do nothing,"" a bystander responded. ""Not here.""

FBI Director Kash Patel posted on social media: “Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available."" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation, adding that “hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”

While Colorado Parks and Wildlife has reported recovery of brown trout and rainbow trout in the channel, neither are a native species. The agency has found evidence of native sculpin in the area.

Aquatic life is returning more quickly than anticipated in the Colorado River Connectivity Channel near Granby.

This news is according to the latest Colorado Parks and Wildlife electrofishing survey of the trout population along the newly constructed 1-mile river channel . In May, Parks and Wildlife biologists estimated that approximately 848 brown trout and 221 rainbow trout over 6 inches in length live within the channel.

The $33 million connectivity channel project sought to establish connectivity along the Colorado River after the construction of the 445-acre-foot Windy Gap Reservoir in 1985 disrupted flows in the region. The reservoir and dam — which were constructed to help divert water to two northern Front Range cities — impacted stream flows, caused sediment buildup, and decimated fish populations.

The Colorado River Connectivity Channel project was led by a coalition group that included the reservoir’s operator, Northern Water. It was completed in the fall of 2023.

While the full benefits of the connectivity channel could take years to manifest, the latest fish survey, as well as one conducted in 2024, already show river health improving, Parks and Wildlife reported.

The fall 2024 survey found evidence of native sculpin — a bottom-dwelling fish — returning to the upper Colorado River and new channel after several decades of absence in nearly 30 miles of their former habitat. In a news release , Dan Kowalski, Parks and Wildlife’s aquatic research scientist, said their return was “a good indication that the channel is starting to improve the ecological health of the river.”

Jon Ewert, Parks and Wildlife’s Hot Sulphur Springs aquatic biologist, said in the release that the discovery of healthy adult trout was particularly exciting since the agency has not stocked any fish in the channel.

According to the agency, biologists have also observed “extensive” brown trout spawning activity and “moderate” rainbow trout spawning activity in the channel.

“Seeing such positive results with water flowing through this new river section for just over a year, we anticipate that this fish population will continue to grow,” Ewert stated in the release.

Currently, the new river section is closed to public fishing access. Parks and Wildlife expects to open it after the area has had sufficient time to fully revegetate, which it reports will take a couple more growing seasons.",Editor’s Note: A previous version of this story inaccurately reported that native trout species had returned to the channel.

That original visa expired in February 2023, and he had applied for asylum. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.

The FBI said later Sunday night it was ""conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder"" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.

Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts and a federal hate crimes charge.

The walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also yelled ""End Zionist!"" during the attack.

Police said the victims included eight women and seven men, whose ages range from 25 to 88. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be ""safe to say"" that person was in critical condition.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a ""very loving person."" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.

The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.

UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.

Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.

Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday's event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said FBI agents were at the scene Sunday afternoon.

U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi released a statement Monday after the federal charge was filed. ""The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Our prayers are with the victims and our Jewish community across the world,"" she said.

Bondi added, ""This vile anti-Semitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC,"" referring to the fatal shooting of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21. ""We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.""

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media that the ""National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,"" according to the Reuters news agency.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a ""heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.""

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" Polis said. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Run for Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, ""This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release."" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk.

Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.

""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,"" said Victor.

Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.

""I saw the aftermath,"" said street performer Peter Irish. ""It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.""

University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, ""My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.""

We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed. Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured. We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon:","A suspect is in custody after what authorities call a ""targeted act of violence"" at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado.

The attack happened just before 1:30 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening new briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw incendiary devices into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

The six victims were between the ages of 67 and 88, Michalek said. Four were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone. He said Soliman sustained minor injuries and was treated at an area hospital.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement that the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders — at every level, in every state, in every country — to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated. The order remained in effect along the Pearl Street corridor from Broadway to 15th Street and from Lawry Lane to Spruce Street as of 8:11 p.m.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder in Congress, called for Americans to stop the spread of antisemitism.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said his department received reports early Sunday afternoon of a man with a weapon and people being set on fire on Pearl Street. A male suspect with minor injuries was taken into police custody at the scene, Redfearn said.

""Run for Their Lives,"" which was hosting an event in Boulder on Sunday, organizes run and walk events calling for the immediate release of all hostages being held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The police chief could not confirm whether the pro-Israel event attendees were targeted as there were people not affiliated with the group out in the area, but he said ""this act is unacceptable.""

""The movement started by a group of Israelis in the Bay Area in California, in collaboration with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum (#BringThemHomeNow),"" the group's website states. ""But, local events are independently led by dedicated and committed leaders within their communities.""

""You don’t need to be Jewish or Israeli to be disturbed by this crisis—all people around the world should be,"" the website says. ""Innocent children, women, the elderly, and young people should not be living in tunnels 20 meters underground for over a year—they should be in their homes with their families. Until this crisis is resolved, the world risks normalizing this unbearable situation. Our focus is not on the ""how"" (pressure world leaders or military pressure). We are solely focused on the ‘what’: doing everything possible to bring them home!""

Fox News Digital has reached out to the group.

Boulder's Jewish Community said that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers participating in the event.

""We are aware of reports of an attack at today's Boulder Run for Their Lives event - a weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages kidnapped on 10/7,"" the Anti-Defamation League wrote on X.

A motive for the attack has not been determined, the chief said.

""I cannot confirm right now that this was targeted at a specific group of people,"" Redfearn said. ""We understand that there's a lot of tensions right now and a lot of issues in the United States and everywhere. Once we have a clear motive, we will react accordingly.""

Multiple people at Boulder's Pearl Street Mall in Colorado were burned when they were attacked by a man during a march for Israeli hostages Sunday, according to police.

Authorities said the violent incident happened at 1:26 p.m. at 13th Street and Pearl Street. Police asked everyone to avoid the area while first responders work the scene.

Boulder police said officers are evacuating the 1200, 1300, and 1400 blocks of Pearl Street between Walnut and Pine as they investigate what happened. ""PLEASE AVOID THIS AREA,"" the department tweeted at 3:08 p.m.

Video of the scene shows what appears to be a burn scar in front of the old courthouse and a person being taken away on a stretcher. Photos from a viewer show the man suspected of the attack being taken into custody by police.

According to law enforcement sources, at least five people suffered burn injuries. UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit.

In a press conference at 4 p.m., police said the scene is not yet safe and they have a vehicle of interest. Authorities said a suspect has been taken into custody.

Witnesses at the scene told CBS Colorado that the suspect attacked people with Molotov cocktails who were participating in a walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said around 3:30 p.m. that FBI agents are at the scene. Boulder police said the attack is under investigation and are working to determine if that is the case, and that it's too early to speculate on the attacker's motive.

WASHINGTON, United States — Several people were injured Sunday in what the FBI called a ""targeted terror attack"" in the US state of Colorado, where a group was protesting for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,"" FBI chief Kash Patel said on X.

Local media cited eyewitnesses describing a man throwing something resembling a homemade Molotov cocktail at a group calling for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Asked if it was a terror attack against the protesters, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn insisted it was ""way too early to speculate motive"" behind the incident, which took place shortly before 1:30 pm (1930 GMT).

In one video apparently of the attack, a shirtless man holding clear spray bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"", ""Palestine is Free!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red t-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Redfearn told reporters that ""initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,"" adding that police arrived ""very quickly.""

""When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,"" he said.

Police on the scene ""immediately encountered that suspect, who was taken into custody without incident,"" Redfearn said.

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that it was ""aware of reports of an attack at today's Boulder Run for Their Lives event.""

That event, it said, was a ""weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages"" who were seized during Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, sparking the war in Gaza.

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in New York voiced outrage at the attack.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

""Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing a Molotov cocktails at them,"" he said.

The attack happened just before 1:30 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening new briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw incendiary devices into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

The six victims were between the ages of 67 and 88, Michalek said. Four were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone. He said Soliman sustained minor injuries and was treated at an area hospital.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement that the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders — at every level, in every state, in every country — to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated. The order remained in effect along the Pearl Street corridor from Broadway to 15th Street and from Lawry Lane to Spruce Street as of 8:11 p.m.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder in Congress, called for Americans to stop the spread of antisemitism.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”

The attack happened around 1:30 p.m. in the area of the historic courthouse at 1235 Pearl St. Law enforcement initially said six victims were taken to hospitals. On Sunday night, Boulder police said after receiving updated information, they have now identified eight victims -- four women and four men between ages 52 and 88.

Miri Kornfeld, an organizer with a group that holds weekly walks to raise awareness of Israeli hostages, told 9NEWS the group was walking on Pearl Street on Sunday afternoon. When they arrived at the courthouse, a man was waiting there with bottles, Kornfeld said. He threw the bottles, and multiple people were burned, including one woman who was badly burned and had to roll on the ground to put the fire out, she said.

People on the scene pointed out the suspect to officers, Redfearn said, and he was taken into custody without incident. He was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, Redfearn said.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,"" Patel said in the post.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence, and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Michalek said. ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country. This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation.""

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.""

“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon, and my wife Andrea and I are praying for the victims,"" Neguse said. ""Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence. We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”","Witnesses reported the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd, the FBI said."

The attack happened around 1:30 p.m. in the area of the historic courthouse at 1235 Pearl St. Law enforcement initially said six victims were taken to hospitals. On Sunday night, Boulder police said after receiving updated information, they have now identified eight victims -- four women and four men between ages 52 and 88.

Miri Kornfeld, an organizer with a group that holds weekly walks to raise awareness of Israeli hostages, told 9NEWS the group was walking on Pearl Street on Sunday afternoon. When they arrived at the courthouse, a man was waiting there with bottles, Kornfeld said. He threw the bottles, and multiple people were burned, including one woman who was badly burned and had to roll on the ground to put the fire out, she said.

People on the scene pointed out the suspect to officers, Redfearn said, and he was taken into custody without incident. He was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, Redfearn said.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,"" Patel said in the post.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence, and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Michalek said. ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country. This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation.""

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.""

“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon, and my wife Andrea and I are praying for the victims,"" Neguse said. ""Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence. We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”","Witnesses reported the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd, the FBI said."

WASHINGTON, United States — Several people were injured Sunday in what the FBI called a ""targeted terror attack"" in the US state of Colorado, where a group was protesting for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,"" FBI chief Kash Patel said on X.

Local media cited eyewitnesses describing a man throwing something resembling a homemade Molotov cocktail at a group calling for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Asked if it was a terror attack against the protesters, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn insisted it was ""way too early to speculate motive"" behind the incident, which took place shortly before 1:30 pm (1930 GMT).

In one video apparently of the attack, a shirtless man holding clear spray bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"", ""Palestine is Free!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red t-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Redfearn told reporters that ""initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,"" adding that police arrived ""very quickly.""

""When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,"" he said.

Police on the scene ""immediately encountered that suspect, who was taken into custody without incident,"" Redfearn said.

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that it was ""aware of reports of an attack at today's Boulder Run for Their Lives event.""

That event, it said, was a ""weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages"" who were seized during Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, sparking the war in Gaza.

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in New York voiced outrage at the attack.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

""Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing a Molotov cocktails at them,"" he said.

""Make no mistake -- this is not a political protest, this is terrorism.""","Several people were injured Sunday in what the FBI called a &quot;targeted terror attack&quot; in the US state of Colorado, where a group was protesting for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

It's Bloodier."": Scott Derrickson Promises a Bigger Bloodbath in 'Black Phone 2'","Blumhouse's The Black Phone became an unexpected horror genre gem back in 2022, delivering terrifying scares to a breath-holding global audience and earning ten times its reported production budget in the process. This then led to the in-canon short film Dreamkill, a part of the anthology film V/H/S/85, and the unsurprising news that such a triumph had sparked a sequel. Now, three years later, that sequel is almost here, and the movie's millions of fans are ready to indulge in more chilling greatness.

Once again directed and co-written by the great Scott Derrickson, also known for his work on Sinister and Doctor Strange, Black Phone 2 features a stellar new and returning cast that includes Ethan Hawke's reprisal of the sadistic killer, The Grabber; Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, and Miguel Mora, among others. The movie is set for an October 2025 release, perfectly timed to coincide with the spooky celebrations of the devil's favorite month.

In celebration of the release of the film's first trailer, Collider's Perri Nemiroff got to chat with Derrickson to discuss all things Black Phone 2, including the timeline between the first and second installments, what it was like crafting The Grabber's new look, delivering a bloodier sequel, the biggest challenges of his filmmaking career, and more.

There Will Be a Significant In-World Gap Between the First and Second 'Black Phone'

""This movie takes place four years after the first film.""

PERRI NEMIROFF: Did you have a break story moment when developing the sequel script, something you came up with along the way that convinced you that it was worth going around again with this concept?

SCOTT DERRICKSON: That's a good question. It was a process, really. As soon as the first movie was a hit, Universal was asking me to make a sequel, hoping I'd make a sequel. I didn't feel obliged to do that, but I certainly wasn't going to do it if I didn't have a reason to do it beyond any kind of cash grab. So I was looking for an idea, and Joe Hill emailed me a pitch for a sequel. Some of it I didn't respond to, but there was an idea within that email that I thought was fantastic that I had never thought of. So, I started to noodle on that idea.

Then, really, what made me decide to go ahead and commit to making a sequel was that I realized if I went and made another movie first and didn't go straight into a sequel, which I'm sure everybody would have liked, if I waited and made another movie first, then these kids would be in high school. Mason [Thames] would be 17, and Madeleine McGraw would be 15. That became a very exciting prospect to me to be able to continue with these characters, but in a really different phase of their lives, both as characters and as actors. These kids would really be in high school, and we’d make a high school coming-of-age horror film as opposed to a middle school movie. Once I had that idea, I think that's when I committed to doing it.

I'll lean into the age gap. How does them being teenagers change their fight against The Grabber this time around?

DERRICKSON: Their fight against The Grabber is very different because the circumstances are so different than in the first film. What's interesting to me about the age difference is that the movement from middle school age to high school age is maybe the most traumatic single change you go through in your life. You really enter a different universe of understanding and emotions and feelings and friendships and relationships, everything, when you move from middle school into high school. I also think that some of the things that you feel when you're in high school at that age are some of the most powerful things you feel in your life. So, that age is really interesting to me. I haven't really explored high school in a film before. You've got characters who are more mature, have more experience, and more emotions to grapple with, but they're also characters who dealt with a lot just a few years earlier. This movie takes place four years after the first film, and that means much more dramatic emotions and stakes, even, for their encounter with the supernatural terrors of the emotion.

How do the supernatural terrors evolve? Of course, The Grabber did not make it through the furst movie, so how does that change what they're up against?

DERRICKSON: Well, that's a spoiler question. I'm not going to answer any specifics of that, but you can gather and infer whatever you like from the trailer. There's a lot there, without giving away too much of the story.

""It's more violent. It's bloodier.""

How would you define the two films? Of course, you want to continue the story, but you also want the second film to have a different feel, so is there any unique descriptor you'd apply to Black Phone 2?

DERRICKSON: There's definitely a different thematic thing going on, but I think that it goes back to what I said initially. I think the first Black Phone is more of a supernatural thriller than it is a horror film. I've always thought that. It's classified as a horror film because of some of the extremities it gets into. But when you make a high school horror film of any kind, there's a certain expectation for it to satisfy an audience's desire for some elevated, escalated horror. So, this film is more graphic. It's more violent. It's bloodier. There's a severity and extremity to it that goes beyond the first movie. It's definitely a horror film.

Another thing I was curious about is how the sequel narrative splits time between Finney and Gwen, because they were largely on separate missions last time. Are we in for the same type of narrative format in film two?

DERRICKSON: I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying no, they're not separated. One of the rather strange achievements, really, of the first movie is that Finn and Gwen spend so much of the movie apart, and yet the bond between them is one of the more powerful aspects of that movie. When I went to write the sequel, I really tried to take that into account in a realistic way, who these two would continue to be toward each other, having experienced what they experienced in the first film. How would they be carrying those events into their high school years? They had very different experiences, and they're carrying those events very differently, but they're very bonded and would continue to be very bonded. They have a lot that happens that they're in together much more than in the first film.

In addition to the characters getting older, you also referenced that Mason and Madeleine have evolved a lot as actors. Can you tease something you were able to accomplish with their characters only because of how they've honed their skills as actors over the last few years?

DERRICKSON: Honestly, with both of them, I never had to do a lot of directing other than I just talked to them like adults, even when they were in middle school. I always spoke to them like I would any really good, solid adult actor. I talked to them about the intentions of the scene and what the character might be processing, and I would only do that if I had done a take or two and thought that they could use that information. Most of the time, I don't have to tell them anything. They’re just such good actors.

Part of the appeal of doing the sequel was to be able to return to working with those kids. And Miguel Mora, also, who played Robin, is in this. Mason is going to be a big star, from How to Train Your Dragon, and then this movie. He's such a smart, sophisticated kid, who doesn't seem very interested in celebrity, doesn't really seem to be drawn to the trappings of being a big-time actor. He just loves acting. He’s really worked at it. So has Miguel Mora and so has Maddie. So, the result was even less direction, to be honest.

The only thing I would always do is if a scene required extreme emotional output, I’d give them fair warning. I'd say to Madeleine, “Hey, on Thursday, we're shooting this scene, and you're going to have to really come apart at the seams. I just want you to be ready for that.” That was always a bit daunting for them, but it always worked, as they would always come to set ready to emote in some pretty extreme ways, and that's all on film.

The Process of Crafting The Grabber's Face is Meticulous

""The process of looking at artwork is always one of shaping and whittling down.""

I have to ask about two particular scenes from the trailer. The one that caught my eye big time was that bloody phone booth shot. Can you tease what might be going on in there, and also share a little something about what it takes to film something like that?

DERRICKSON: I'm not going to say anything specifically about it. I think the mystery of that image in the trailer plays really great. What I like about the trailer is that it doesn't give much away story-wise, which I think people appreciate more often than not, but it does feel like the movie, and there is plenty that you can infer from watching it. That was an idea that I had that I wasn't sure was going to even work when I conceptualized it. I will say that there's more to that moment than what you see in the trailer.

Another thing we'll have to tread lightly with is when The Grabber rips his mask off. That's a very shocking design you've come up with there. Can you walk me through finding the right look for the state of his face?

DERRICKSON: With any in-camera makeup effect, the only way that I ever know to do something like that is to try to envision something as a starting point or find visual references, but to go to a great makeup artist, which we had on this movie, and sort of describe it and then let him work with concept artists and bring the artwork. The process of looking at artwork is always one of shaping and whittling down, like, “I like this. I don't like this. I like this aspect. I don't like this aspect. Try again based on that feedback.” You keep going until you've got something there, like, “Aha! That's it. That's great.” Then the makeup effects department has to go in and actually make that work in a way that is safe and time-efficient.

'The Black Phone' is a Project of Childhood Passion for Scott Derrickson

""I poured so much of my childhood and early middle school years into The Black Phone.""

One of the things that struck me most about the first film is that, while it's super dark and intense, ultimately it's an inspiring story. What's the key to crafting a sequel story that does delve back into that darkness, but without necessarily taking away from the hope that the first movie achieved?

DERRICKSON: That’s a super incisive question that I really appreciate. Ethan [Hawke], when he saw the first cut of the first movie, he texted me and he said, “This is the first time I've seen a horror film that is told from the point of view of love.” And I knew what he meant by that. In the first movie, hope and love are as powerful of forces as fear, which is rare for a horror film. It is. And I was very committed to continuing that in the second one. I think that even though there are some meaner scenes, there are some definitely more violent scenes, there's more graphic material in this movie, there's also even more emotional scenes. The emotional stakes of these kids’ lives and what they're feeling and what it leads to, what they deal with in the course of the movie, is also more extreme. So, I think that all of those aspects of hope and love are also heightened in the film.

I wanted to make sure to squeeze in a question about the setting, too, because it is a very different look from the first film. What is Alpine Lake Youth Camp, and why did that feel like the right place to set the sequel story?

DERRICKSON: [Laughs] That's really drawing on my experience as a high schooler. I poured so much of my childhood and early middle school years into The Black Phone. In high school, as I got older, I spent more and more time in the Rocky Mountains. I'd ski every weekend, and I spent a lot of time at these winter camps that they have up there. They're really incredible experiences. To be in the violence of that weather, the blizzards and all of that, the beauty of the surrounding mountains, to be in several feet of snow all the time, there's something mesmerizingly powerful about that.

I really like to use weather as a character if I have an opportunity to do it, so the winter, Rocky Mountain camp environment was also an inspiration for me to say yes to doing the movie. Of course, you've got The Shining that you're drawing on because that was The Overlook Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, where they filmed the exterior of that. And, of course, you've got the little tradition of camp horror, but it's almost always summer camp. There aren't a lot of winter camp movies. I went to both as a high school kid, and it was always the winter camps that were more powerful and memorable.

I never thought I'd see The Grabber on skates.

You know I've been following your work since the very beginning, and I've loved seeing your craft evolve from film to film. To lean into that a little, can you tell me a filmmaking first that you achieved making The Black Phone 2?

DERRICKSON: That's a hard question for me to answer because I think every film is a first. Every film is full of firsts! Every time you go to make a movie, you're trying to achieve something totally specific. It's not like anything that you've made or anything that you've seen, hopefully. I think that this is probably the most challenging movie I've made in terms of the complexity of the cinematic elements of it and how the cinematic elements are used to actually tell the story.

The screenplay that I wrote was very confusing to a lot of people, and I knew that it was going to have to be a really disciplined movie in the way that I made it in order for it to not be confusing as a film. Doctor Strange was the same way. A lot of people didn't understand that screenplay. But it's a visual medium, and to be able to write a script that tells everybody what they have to do in preparation to make the sets and light the film the right way, and have the right film stalks, and all of that, you're, as a director, the only person who can navigate all that and make sure that everything is right. But in the end, hopefully — and I think we’ve achieved it in this movie — you make a visual experience that's not difficult to assimilate, even though in written words it may have been very difficult to assimilate. So, this movie was very challenging in that respect.

Part of me feels that I'd have to be a fool to think that there's no way that an illegal gambling ""casino"" exists in Loveland; the other part of me wants to keep my ""rose colored glasses"" view of the Sweetheart City.

In May of 2024, the Colorado Division of Gambling initiated a campaign to discourage the creation of illegal gambling operations. In September of 2024, according to Denver 7, there was a large bust of an illegal casino operating in Colorado, from Greeley to Pueblo.

According to the Denver 7 report, ""gamblers"" would win credits on devices that look like arcade games or virtual slot machines, which they'd turn in for cryptocurrency. Then in turn, they'd convert the ""crypto"" to cash with an ATM nearby.

The Denver man who was arrested for operating the illegal gambling business in 2024, could have gone to prison for 10 years, but was only sentenced to one year and one day. That's a pretty big risk, but then the reward was probably worth it.

That particular operation made the locations appear to be arcades, with the gambling on the ""Downlow,"" as they say. What about an operation that was more of a ""speakeasy"" operation?

Does an Illegal Gambling Casino Exist In Loveland?

In May of 2025, there was speculation that there was an ""underground"" casino, behind closed doors, operating in the Downtown Loveland area. While the idea of a ""speakeasy casino"" does sound like fun, there's no way I'd step foot inside, if I were to find out where the casino was.

The FBI said it was investigating the incident as a ""targeted terror attack"" and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

He was booked into the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to county records. His bond has been set at $10 million.

Police in the city of Boulder said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which took place shortly before 1:30 pm (1930 GMT) at a demonstration outside a mall.

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said the ""violent antisemitic attack"" occurred at Sunday's ""Run for Their Lives"" event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community in solidarity with hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the war in Gaza.

""Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,"" he said, adding that ""the suspect was heard to yell: 'Free Palestine!'""

Boulder Police said that eight victims, four men and four women aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals.

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that ""at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition.""

The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.

In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt ""very, very scared"" after hearing about the attack near his workplace.

Sunday's attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted ""Free Palestine,"" was arrested.

Boulder Police Chief Redfearn insisted it was ""way too early to speculate motive,"" but FBI chief Kash Patel described the attack as ""a targeted terror attack.""

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that the suspect was a foreign national who ""illegally overstayed (his) visa.""

Fox News and CBS both cited US officials as saying Soliman was an Egyptian national.

The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident.

Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also described the Boulder incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" while Attorney General Pam Bondi termed it ""a horrific anti-Semitic attack.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle expressed revulsion.

Update: An FBI spokesman confirmed that there were six victims, aged 67 to 88. The suspect has been identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, of Egyptian origin, who was heard yelling “Free Palestine” during the attack.

“It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” said Mark Michalek, FBI Denver special agent in charge. “Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country. This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation.”

The attack took place at a popular pedestrian mall that attracts tourists and college students. Demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives – with multiple chapters across the world that regularly meet to advocate for the release of hostages in Gaza – had gathered to call for their release.

“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns … [and] a suspect was pointed out to our officers on the scene. Our officers immediately encountered that suspect, who was taken into custody without incident.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was monitoring the situation, adding that “hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”

Redfearn also said the suspect was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, but was not able to release his identity.

“The scene itself is contained, but we have a large area here in downtown Boulder closed off right now,” he added. “Businesses have been closed, and we have asked people to avoid the area. It is not—this area is not safe yet. We’re dealing with a vehicle of interest. We’re dealing with a large area that we are making sure is safe before we allow people to come back.”

The ADL said it reviewed videos from the scene, and believe it heard the suspect saying: “How many children you killed?,” “We have to end Zionists,” and “They are killers.”

The attack happened just before 1:30 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a walk organized by the city’s chapter of “Run for Their Lives,” which calls for the release of hostages held in Gaza by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said it’s under investigation as terrorism in a Sunday evening news briefing, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier that day.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old man whom bystanders pointed out to police officers outside the Boulder County Historic Courthouse, was arrested, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw incendiary devices into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, saying the man yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos show people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

The six victims were between the ages of 67 and 88, Michalek said. Four were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital and two were airlifted to the University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Readfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone. He said Soliman sustained minor injuries and was treated at an area hospital.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media – an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses – and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.” National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders – at every level, in every state, in every country – to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder in Congress, called for Americans to stop the spread of antisemitism.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”",Multiple blocks of downtown Boulder were evacuated Sunday after an attack on the Pearl Street Mall that Gov. Jared Polis characterized as a “heinous act of terror.”

The FBI said it was investigating the incident as a ""targeted terror attack"" and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

He was booked into the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to county records. His bond has been set at $10 million.

Police in the city of Boulder said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which took place shortly before 1:30 pm (1930 GMT) at a demonstration outside a mall.

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said the ""violent antisemitic attack"" occurred at Sunday's ""Run for Their Lives"" event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community in solidarity with hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the war in Gaza.

""Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,"" he said, adding that ""the suspect was heard to yell: 'Free Palestine!'""

Boulder Police said that eight victims, four men and four women aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals.

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that ""at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition.""

The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.

In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt ""very, very scared"" after hearing about the attack near his workplace.

Sunday's attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted ""Free Palestine,"" was arrested.

Boulder Police Chief Redfearn insisted it was ""way too early to speculate motive,"" but FBI chief Kash Patel described the attack as ""a targeted terror attack.""

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that the suspect was a foreign national who ""illegally overstayed (his) visa.""

Fox News and CBS both cited US officials as saying Soliman was an Egyptian national.

The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident.

Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also described the Boulder incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" while Attorney General Pam Bondi termed it ""a horrific anti-Semitic attack.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle expressed revulsion.

""Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror,"" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement. ""Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.""

Several organizations also decried the violence.

""This is an attack on all of us -- and we will not stay silent,"" the Israeli-American Council said in a statement.","A man yelling ""free Palestine"" used incendiary devices to torch protesters rallying in support of Israeli hostages, injuring at least eight people in the US state of Colorado on Sunday.""Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,"" he said, adding that ""the suspect was heard to yell: 'Free Palestine!'"""

At about 1:26 p.m. local time, officers with the Boulder Police Department were called to the county courthouse on Pearl Street for reports of a man, who had a weapon, setting people on fire, according to Boulder Police Department (BPD) Chief Steve Redfearn.

The FBI said six people, ages 67 to 88, were injured and taken to the hospital.

Soliman, who was yelling ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, was arrested at the scene without incident, according to the FBI and BPD.

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of ""ideologically motivated violence,"" based on early information, evidence and witness accounts.

The attack took place near an event put on by ""Run for Their Lives,"" a grassroot organization that facilitates global run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).

The ADL Center on Extremism reviewed videos from the scene and said the suspect appeared to say, ""How many children you killed,"" ""We have to end Zionists, and ""They are killers.""

It is unclear how many people were injured, though police confirmed some were life-threatening.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,"" FBI Director Kash Patel wrote in a statement on X. ""Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.""

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed the National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground.

Police initially evacuated three surrounding blocks and later expanded the evacuation area.

Redfearn said the area is not safe yet, as they are investigating a ""vehicle of interest.""

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said the attack, which happened on the eve of Shavuot, appears to have been a ""hate crime"" targeting Run for Their Lives demonstrators.

""From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,"" Weiser wrote in a statement.

Weiser and Polis were the first two Jewish men elected to statewide office in Colorado in 2018.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is a post to X said ""terror has no place in our great country.""

Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said terrorism against Jews ""does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America.""

""Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages,"" Danon wrote in a statement. ""In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing a Molotov cocktails at them. Make no mistake – this is not a political protest, this is terrorism.

Colorado Rep. Joe Neguse added he is ""praying hard for the victims.""

""The scourge of anti-semitism has metastasized across our country,"" Neguse wrote on X. ""We must do more—now—to stop this violence. Tonight, on the eve of Shavuot, and always, we stand with our Jewish community.""

The New York City Police Department said on Sunday night it is increasing the number of officers at religious sites for Shavuot.

Read the latest news on the Boulder Pearl Street Mall attack here:
• What we know about the Pearl Street Mall attack in Boulder
• Suspect in “anti-semitic terror attack” on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall charged with federal hate crime

BOULDER — Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening news briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

Police and the FBI initially said six people were injured in the attack, but law enforcement officials increased that tally to eight late Sunday night.

The victims include four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, according to Boulder police and the FBI. Authorities initially said four people were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two others were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone.

Soliman was taken to a local hospital to be medically evaluated, then was booked into the Boulder County Jail on “multiple charges.” The jail’s booking log does not show what charges Soliman faces, and police did not say.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement that the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders — at every level, in every state, in every country — to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated. The order remained in effect along the Pearl Street corridor from Broadway to 15th Street and from Lawry Lane to Spruce Street as of 8:11 p.m.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder in Congress, called for Americans to stop the spread of antisemitism.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”

Blattner, the president and CEO of The Jewish Federation of Greater Portland.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Eight people were injured after a man with a makeshift flamethrower yelled ""Free Palestine"" and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd in Boulder, Colorado that had assembled Sunday to raise attention for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the FBI reported.

The FBI said it's investigating the attack as an act of terrorism. The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman and officials believe he acted alone. The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States.

On Sunday afternoon, following the initial reports of the attack in Boulder, Colorado, Marc N. Blattner, the president and CEO of The Jewish Federation of Greater Portland, released a statement about the attack.

""Our hearts and best wishes go out to those injured, their families, and the Boulder community,"" Blattner said in the statement. ""The Jewish Federation condemns these acts unequivocally and remain unwavering in our commitment to confront violence and hatred towards the Jewish community. Moreover, the safety and security of the Jewish community is our top priority, whether here or somewhere else, and we will not rest until that safety is fully restored. ""

Blattner said the federation is still learning details about the attack, and they're in contact with the Jewish community in Boulder and their law enforcement partners to better learn what happened.

""It's shocking. It's sad. I think community members here, of course, they start to feel a little concerned for their own safety,"" said Jessica Anderson, community security director with The Jewish Federation of Greater Portland, who previously served for 24 years in the FBI.

Anderson noted that the attack in Boulder happened just two weeks after a couple who were staff members at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC were shot and killed outside the Capitol Jewish Museum. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was arrested at the scene and is facing multiple charges, including murder and terrorism

""The two events happening in such quick succession, the Washington DC shootings, and then of course this event in Boulder, is hard for people to see, and it's a challenging time for sure for the community across the United States,"" she said.","""The Jewish Federation condemns these acts unequivocally,"" said Marc N.

The suspect was taken into custody.

No charges were immediately announced, but officials said they expect to hold him “fully accountable”.

The attack occurred at a popular pedestrian mall in Boulder, where a group had gathered for an event to draw attention to Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

Injuries ranged from serious to minor.

The suspect was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

Video from the scene showed a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on a bare-chested suspect with containers in each hand.

It occurred more than a week after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington by a Chicago man who yelled: “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza” as he was being led away by police.

FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department, which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations, decried the attack as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans”.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Police in Boulder were more circumspect about a motive.

Police Chief Steve Redfearn said it “would be irresponsible for me to speculate” while witnesses were still being interviewed but noted that the group that had gathered in support of the hostages had assembled peacefully and that injuries of the victims — ranging from serious to minor — were consistent with them having been set on fire.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles northwest of Denver, that killed four people.

The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police.

The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the pedestrian mall.

According to reports, incendiary devices -- which officials say were bottles full of flammable liquid that exploded -- were thrown at the event. At least five people were burned in the attack, according to authorities. Their condition is unknown.

Authorities say a suspect has been taken into custody, but they have declined to release his name at this point.

FBI Director Kash Patel has branded the incident a ""targeted terror attack."" Local law enforcement agents have not yet labeled this an act of terrorism.

Video footage captured the alleged attacker — who law-enforcement sources identified to The Post as Mohammed Soliman — in the middle of a tirade about Palestine and calling for death to “Zionists” before he tossed the fiery containers.

“They are killers! How many children you killed?” he shouted.

It’s unclear how many people in total were hurt, but cops said at least some of the injuries may be life-threatening.

The man was holding bottles of a clear liquid while waiting for the group outside the downtown courthouse, said an organizer for the outdoor weekly commemoration Run For Their Lives in Boulder to 9News.

He then apparently lit the liquid and chucked the containers at the walkers, striking five people and badly burning one woman who had to roll on the ground to extinguish the flames, said the organizer, Miri Kornfeld.

He was booked into the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to county records. His bond has been set at $10 million.

Police in the city of Boulder said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which took place shortly before 1:30 pm (1930 GMT) at a demonstration outside a mall.

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said the ""violent antisemitic attack"" occurred at Sunday's ""Run for Their Lives"" event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community in solidarity with hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the war in Gaza.

""Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,"" he said, adding that ""the suspect was heard to yell: 'Free Palestine!'""

Boulder Police said that eight victims, four men and four women aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals.

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that ""at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition.""

The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.

In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt ""very, very scared"" after hearing about the attack near his workplace.

Sunday's attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted ""Free Palestine,"" was arrested.

Boulder Police Chief Redfearn insisted it was ""way too early to speculate motive,"" but FBI chief Kash Patel described the attack as ""a targeted terror attack.""

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that the suspect was a foreign national who ""illegally overstayed (his) visa.""

Fox News and CBS both cited US officials as saying Soliman was an Egyptian national.

The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident.

Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also described the Boulder incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" while Attorney General Pam Bondi termed it ""a horrific anti-Semitic attack.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle expressed revulsion.

""Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror,"" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement. ""Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.""

• Suspect in “anti-semitic terror attack” on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall charged with federal hate crime

BOULDER — Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening news briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

Police and the FBI initially said six people were injured in the attack, but law enforcement officials increased that tally to eight late Sunday night.

The victims include four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, according to Boulder police and the FBI. Authorities initially said four people were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two others were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone.

Soliman was taken to a local hospital to be medically evaluated, then was booked into the Boulder County Jail on “multiple charges.” The jail’s booking log does not show what charges Soliman faces, and police did not say.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement that the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders — at every level, in every state, in every country — to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated. The order remained in effect along the Pearl Street corridor from Broadway to 15th Street and from Lawry Lane to Spruce Street as of 8:11 p.m.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder in Congress, called for Americans to stop the spread of antisemitism.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”

PORTLAND, Ore. — Eight people were injured after a man with a makeshift flamethrower yelled ""Free Palestine"" and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd in Boulder, Colorado that had assembled Sunday to raise attention for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the FBI reported.

The FBI said it's investigating the attack as an act of terrorism. The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman and officials believe he acted alone. The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States.

On Sunday afternoon, following the initial reports of the attack in Boulder, Colorado, Marc N. Blattner, the president and CEO of The Jewish Federation of Greater Portland, released a statement about the attack.

""Our hearts and best wishes go out to those injured, their families, and the Boulder community,"" Blattner said in the statement. ""The Jewish Federation condemns these acts unequivocally and remain unwavering in our commitment to confront violence and hatred towards the Jewish community. Moreover, the safety and security of the Jewish community is our top priority, whether here or somewhere else, and we will not rest until that safety is fully restored. ""

Blattner said the federation is still learning details about the attack, and they're in contact with the Jewish community in Boulder and their law enforcement partners to better learn what happened.

""It's shocking. It's sad. I think community members here, of course, they start to feel a little concerned for their own safety,"" said Jessica Anderson, community security director with The Jewish Federation of Greater Portland, who previously served for 24 years in the FBI.

Anderson noted that the attack in Boulder happened just two weeks after a couple who were staff members at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC were shot and killed outside the Capitol Jewish Museum. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was arrested at the scene and is facing multiple charges, including murder and terrorism

Video footage captured the alleged attacker — who law-enforcement sources identified to The Post as Mohammed Soliman — in the middle of a tirade about Palestine and calling for death to “Zionists” before he tossed the fiery containers.

“They are killers! How many children you killed?” he shouted.

It’s unclear how many people in total were hurt, but cops said at least some of the injuries may be life-threatening.

The man was holding bottles of a clear liquid while waiting for the group outside the downtown courthouse, said an organizer for the outdoor weekly commemoration Run For Their Lives in Boulder to 9News.

He then apparently lit the liquid and chucked the containers at the walkers, striking five people and badly burning one woman who had to roll on the ground to extinguish the flames, said the organizer, Miri Kornfeld.

The attack occurred at a popular pedestrian mall in Boulder, where a group had gathered for an event to draw attention to Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Police in Boulder were more circumspect about a motive.

Police Chief Steve Redfearn said it “would be irresponsible for me to speculate” while witnesses were still being interviewed but noted that the group that had gathered in support of the hostages had assembled peacefully and that injuries of the victims — ranging from serious to minor — were consistent with them having been set on fire.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles northwest of Denver, that killed four people.

The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police.

The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the pedestrian mall.

• Suspect in “anti-semitic terror attack” on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall charged with federal hate crime

BOULDER — Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening news briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

Police and the FBI initially said six people were injured in the attack, but law enforcement officials increased that tally to eight late Sunday night.

The victims include four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, according to Boulder police and the FBI. Authorities initially said four people were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two others were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone.

Soliman was taken to a local hospital to be medically evaluated, then was booked into the Boulder County Jail on “multiple charges.” The jail’s booking log does not show what charges Soliman faces, and police did not say.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

• What we know about the Pearl Street Mall attack in Boulder
• Suspect in “anti-semitic terror attack” on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall charged with federal hate crime

BOULDER — Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening news briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

Police and the FBI initially said six people were injured in the attack, but law enforcement officials increased that tally to eight late Sunday night.

The victims include four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, according to Boulder police and the FBI. Authorities initially said four people were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two others were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone.

Soliman was taken to a local hospital to be medically evaluated, then was booked into the Boulder County Jail on “multiple charges.” The jail’s booking log does not show what charges Soliman faces, and police did not say.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement that the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders — at every level, in every state, in every country — to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated. The order remained in effect along the Pearl Street corridor from Broadway to 15th Street and from Lawry Lane to Spruce Street as of 8:11 p.m.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder in Congress, called for Americans to stop the spread of antisemitism.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”

According to local media, eyewitnesses described a man throwing an object resembling a homemade Molotov cocktail at participants in a weekly demonstration demanding the return of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.

Boulder Police chief Steve Redfearn said, “It’s way too early to speculate motive,” when asked if it was a terror attack targeting the protest.

A video from the scene shows a shirtless man with spray bottles in hand, pacing as flames burn on the grass. He is heard shouting: “End Zionists!”, “Palestine is free!”, and “They are killers!” toward people in red T-shirts tending to an injured person.

“Initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” Redfearn told reporters. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”

He confirmed the suspect was taken into custody on the spot without incident.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said it was aware of an attack at the Boulder Run for Their Lives event — a weekly gathering of Jewish community members supporting hostages captured during Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations in New York condemned the violence, saying, “Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border — it is already burning the streets of America.”

“Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing Molotov cocktails at them,” he said.

BOULDER — Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”

• What we know about the Pearl Street Mall attack in Boulder
• Suspect in “anti-semitic terror attack” on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall charged with federal hate crime

BOULDER — Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening news briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

Police and the FBI initially said six people were injured in the attack, but law enforcement officials increased that tally to eight late Sunday night.

The victims include four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, according to Boulder police and the FBI. Authorities initially said four people were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two others were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone.

Soliman was taken to a local hospital to be medically evaluated, then was booked into the Boulder County Jail on “multiple charges.” The jail’s booking log does not show what charges Soliman faces, and police did not say.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement that the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders — at every level, in every state, in every country — to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated. The order remained in effect along the Pearl Street corridor from Broadway to 15th Street and from Lawry Lane to Spruce Street as of 8:11 p.m.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

BOULDER — Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening news briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

Police and the FBI initially said six people were injured in the attack, but law enforcement officials increased that tally to eight late Sunday night.

The victims include four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, according to Boulder police and the FBI. Authorities initially said four people were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two others were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone.

Soliman was taken to a local hospital to be medically evaluated, then was booked into the Boulder County Jail on “multiple charges.” The jail’s booking log does not show what charges Soliman faces, and police did not say.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement that the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders — at every level, in every state, in every country — to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated. The order remained in effect along the Pearl Street corridor from Broadway to 15th Street and from Lawry Lane to Spruce Street as of 8:11 p.m.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder in Congress, called for Americans to stop the spread of antisemitism.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”

According to local media, eyewitnesses described a man throwing an object resembling a homemade Molotov cocktail at participants in a weekly demonstration demanding the return of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.

Boulder Police chief Steve Redfearn said, “It’s way too early to speculate motive,” when asked if it was a terror attack targeting the protest.

A video from the scene shows a shirtless man with spray bottles in hand, pacing as flames burn on the grass. He is heard shouting: “End Zionists!”, “Palestine is free!”, and “They are killers!” toward people in red T-shirts tending to an injured person.

“Initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” Redfearn told reporters. “When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”

He confirmed the suspect was taken into custody on the spot without incident.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said it was aware of an attack at the Boulder Run for Their Lives event — a weekly gathering of Jewish community members supporting hostages captured during Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations in New York condemned the violence, saying, “Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border — it is already burning the streets of America.”

“Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing Molotov cocktails at them,” he said.

“Make no mistake — this is not a political protest, this is terrorism,” he added.",Eyewitnesses saw a man throw a homemade Molotov cocktail at protesters demanding the release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.

Suspect thought to be immigrant from Kuwait. Attack leaves 6 seriously injured.

Conservative social media pundit, Laura Loomer has identified, Mohamad Soiman (also being spelt as Mohammed Soiman) as the alleged suspect behind Sunday’s Boulder, Colorado ‘molotov’ terror attack.

Soliman is alleged to have thrown Molotov cocktails at participants of a pro-Israel demonstration on Pearl Street, injuring multiple people circa 1:26 p.m, Sunday afternoon.

Prominent X accounts, including Raws Alerts and political commentator Laura Loomer, have publicly named Soliman as the attacker. However, authorities have not yet officially confirmed his identity.

Soliman was observed holding bottles of a clear liquid while waiting for the group outside the downtown courthouse according to witnesses. Soliman leading up to the assault was seen calling for death to ‘Zionists’ before tossing the fiery molotov containers into gathered peace walkers.

‘They are killers! How many children you killed?’ he shouted.

‘End Zionists! they are terrorists’ and ‘free Palestine’. Soliman shouted.

It’s unclear how many people in total were hurt, but cops said at least some of the injuries may be life-threatening, including one woman who was badly burned. As of 7 p.m local time, six had been reported injured ranging from ages of from 67 to 88 years old.

University student Brooke Coffman said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs after the attack. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she told Reuters.

During a Sunday afternoon press conference, authorities said a suspect was taken into custody. They said that multiple people were injured and taken to local hospitals, some of which have since been transferred to other hospitals.

Posted Laura Loomer on X: ‘Mohamad Soliman, the Muslim man who carried out the Islamic terrorist attack in Colorado today, appears to be an immigrant from Kuwait who recently arrived in the US under Joe Biden’s open border policies 2 YEARS AGO. He has been arrested. A professional profile for a man who has his same name and looks just like him says he works in finance, digital marketing, and international financial reporting. He also appears to have at least one daughter who is studying in the United States in Colorado. He speaks English and Arabic.’

Posted a social media user allegedly at the scene, ‘He was shouting pro-Palestine propaganda with a thick accent.’

Read another account, ‘Jews Fight Back,’: After trying to burn Jews alive in Boulder, Colorado today, Mohamad Soliman ranted about “children being killed” and “Until Palestine is free.”

Witnesses at the scene told CBS Colorado that the suspect attacked people with Molotov cocktails who were participating in a walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

FBI Director Kash Patel described the incident as a terrorist attack, with FBI agents at the scene at 3:30 p.m. Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said the attack was under investigation with police still working to determine if it was indeed a ‘hate crime’ terrorist attack specifically targeting Jewish protesters, saying that it was too early to speculate on the attacker’s motive.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk organized by ‘Run For Their Lives,’ told CBS Colorado that participants had been holding ‘silent marches’ every week since Oct. 7 to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages each week, Victor told the outlet. The protester said around 30 people were participating in Sunday’s walk.

Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. Victor said that that participants had never expected someone would attack them.

‘So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn’t even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I’m just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,’ said Victor.

Read a joint statement from Boulder’s Jewish community in the aftermath in part:

We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.

We don’t have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed.

Sunday’s attack less than two weeks after a couple was shot dead outside an event at Washington D.C‘s Capital Jewish Museum by a suspect who shouted, ‘Free, free Palestine!’ as he was taken into custody.

The victims, Yaron Lischinsky, 28, and Sarah Milgrim, 26 — a pair of Israeli Embassy workers about to be engaged — were allegedly fatally gunned down by Chicago born, left radical activist, Elias Rodriguez, 31.

Rodriguez in a purported online manifesto criticized Irael’s ongoing assault in Gaza and the claim that only violence was now the ‘only sane option’ to bring an end to the ongoing strife.","Mohamad Soliman id as Boulder, Colorado molotov terrorist suspect who attacked Jewish peace rally as attack leaves countless injured."

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted as an act of terrorism,” Michalek said.

Boulder’s Jewish Community said in a statement that the demonstrators were participating in the Run for Their Lives Walk, a movement raising awareness and calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas.

“Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured,” the Jewish group said. “When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.”

Colorado Governor Jared Polis said he was monitoring the situation.

“My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror,” he wrote on X. “Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”

State Secretary Marco Rubio offered up prayers for the victims, adding that “terror has no place in our great country.”

The Colorado attack followed the fatal shooting of a couple working for the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. last month.","['Eight victims suffered burns after callers reported that a man was setting people on fire.', 'Eight victims suffered burns after callers reported that a man was setting people on fire.']"

But this is 2025, with the media’s moral compass still spinning wildly and antisemitism extremely fashionable on the political left. So, instead of acknowledging the obvious, CNN went into full denial mode the moment the FBI under Director Kash Patel called the Boulder firebombing exactly what it was: a targeted terror attack.

Despite the local police chief declining to confirm whether the Boulder attack was targeted, the FBI has classified it as such. The victims were part of the “Run for Their Lives” global walk—an event calling for Hamas to release hostages—and children were among those present. While the exact number of injuries isn’t clear yet, multiple people were hospitalized following the attack.

The suspect, Mohamad Soliman, didn’t quietly sneak in through the back door. He crashed the pro-Israel gathering in Boulder, Colorado, shouting anti-Israel slogans. He then launched into a violent assault—chucking incendiary devices at innocent people.

The FBI’s response under the new Trump-appointed leadership was swift and unflinching. “We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,” Patel said. “Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.”

So far, pretty straightforward. A man firebombs Jews and allies while shouting pro-Hamas rhetoric? That’s a textbook act of terrorism. But not to CNN, which dragged out none other than disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe—yes, that Andrew McCabe, the one fired for lying under oath—to cast doubt on the FBI’s assessment.

You really can’t make this stuff up.

CNN’s Juliette Kayyem tried to set the tone: “Local authorities are saying one thing, and the FBI is saying something slightly different.” Enter McCabe, who immediately downplayed the situation: “Yeah, that’s never a great start… I think that the press conference we saw, one thing was abundantly clear, is they—the local authorities—were being very, very careful, and I think that’s the right approach at this point. They don’t have a clear idea…”

Of course, the real issue for CNN and their pals like McCabe isn’t that they think the FBI jumped the gun—it’s that the bureau dared to call out terrorism when it didn’t fit the preferred narrative.

“This is the sort of thing that the FBI really can help out a local police department with,” McCabe said, digging further. “We don’t step in and take over and draw conclusions five minutes after the attack.”

Riiiiight. If the Boulder firebombing had targeted a pride parade instead of a pro-Israel event, the media would’ve immediately blamed conservative Christians—just like they did after the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. Back then, the press rushed to frame the massacre as an anti-LGBT hate crime driven by Christian bigotry, despite the shooter being a Muslim who pledged allegiance to ISIS. Later, even left-wing outlets admitted the attack wasn’t motivated by anti-LGBT hate at all. Still, the false narrative persists,

As for what happened in Boulder, since the attacker was parroting Hamas talking points, we have to “wait for all the facts” even though the suspects motives are quite clear.

A suspect is in custody and police are investigating what FBI officials immediately called ""a targeted terror attack"" - though the local authorities said it was too early to define the attack.

""When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims ... with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,"" Boulder police chief Stephen Redfearn said on Sunday (US time).

The man threw bottles that apparently contained flammable liquid that hit the ground and exploded in flames, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told CNN, noting the exact number of bottles was unclear.

The reported attack took place at the Boulder Run for Their Lives event, the Anti-Defamation League said on social media. The weekly gathering of Jewish community members is meant to support the hostages taken during the 7 October attacks in Israel, in 2023.

The ADL noted that the incident happened ahead of the holiday of Shavuot, according to the ADL - a Jewish holiday which celebrates the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people on Mount Sinai.

The eight injured include four women and four men, ages 52 to 88, who were taken to hospitals in the Denver metro area, Boulder police said.

One victim was ""very seriously injured,"" according to Redfearn. Four victims were taken to Boulder Community Hospital. Two victims were airlifted to the Denver metro area, the chief said.

""Our thoughts are heavily focused on their recovery,"" he added.

""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza,"" Boulder's Jewish community said in a joint statement to CNN.

An eyewitness told CNN of seeing people whose pants were completely burned and singed off.

Brian H, who did not want to give his last name due to safety concerns, said he and his family were dining outside when a woman ran from the nearby Boulder courthouse to warn them a man was throwing fire at people.

Brian said he ran into the courtyard, where he said he saw a man carrying a tank on his back that resembled a gardening chemical sprayer.

""I saw fabric coming out of it, and I quickly realised that it was a Molotov cocktail. One had already exploded right in front of us,"" Brian said.

He saw another man trying to talk the suspect down, but the suspect kept yelling, ""F**k you, Zionist,"" ""You all deserve to die,"" and ""You've killed these children.""

""He was very erratic, shouting and spewing terrible things at different people,"" Brian said.

After calling 911, Brian went to help victims. He described seeing an elderly woman lying on the ground, unresponsive.

""There were several people attending to her and wrapping her up, trying to ensure she was ok,"" he said. While people from a restaurant were bringing large buckets of ice water to help extinguish the flames.

He said he grabbed a bucket and filled it with water from a fountain in the middle of the courtyard: ""I just kept filling that up and pouring it on their legs"".

Suspect reportedly yelled 'Free Palestine' during attack and used 'makeshift flamethrower' - police

CNN reported that Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was the suspect in the attack and reportedly used what authorities called ""a makeshift flamethrower"".

""This attack happened at a regularly scheduled, weekly peaceful event,"" FBI Denver Special Agent-in-Charge Mark D Michalek said during a news conference on Sunday.

""Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd.""

It is unclear if Soliman has an attorney at this time. Authorities said Soliman was injured during the attack and was taken to a hospital.

""The FBI shares in the sorrow of the Boulder community, especially to those who have family or friends injured in this tragedy,"" Michalek said.

""At this point, we do not believe that there is an additional suspect at large,"" Police Chief Redfearn said.

When asked if there was evidence the suspect acted as part of a ""greater network"" or specific group, Michalek said, ""Not at this time.""

""The subject is in custody, but this will be a thorough and complete investigation, and those checks are ongoing,"" Michalek said.

Witness describes seeing a 'big fire go up' after attack

A witness to the attack described seeing a ""big fire go up"", they told Colorado TV station KUSA.

Brooke Coffman said she was on the phone with her mother during her lunch break, approximately 100 to 150 feet away from the Boulder courthouse, when she ""saw some flags moving around,"" ""people wrestling,"" and ""like someone was getting beat up or something.""

When she saw the flames, Coffman said she hung up on her mother, ran over to the area and called 911.

""There was a kid yelling, 'Call 911,'"" Coffman recalled. ""People on the street were just yelling, 'Call 911.' People were running.""

Coffman told KUSA she jumped over a small fence to get to two women who were ""rolling around a bit"" on the grass and in their underwear from stripping off their pants.

She asked how she could help and saw how extensive their burns were.

""They have really bad burns all up on their legs,"" she said. One of the victims was screaming and ""was wrapped in a flag.""

""It just wasn't a good scene and she was, definitely needed help,"" she said. ""It was just not obviously a good thing to see.""

FBI agents and federal prosecutors are reviewing the circumstances of the incident to determine whether the individual will be charged with terrorism or under other possible federal criminal statutes, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.

The source stressed potential mental health concerns had not yet been ruled out, which could factor into any charging decision.

""Department of Justice agents with local law enforcement are investigating the tragic attack in Boulder, Colorado,"" a Department of Justice spokesperson said in a statement.

""Our hearts and prayers go out to all those affected by this needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans. We will follow the facts and prosecute all perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law.""

FBI director Kash Patel said in a social media post that ""we are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.""

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino added: ""We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence.""

Colorado Governor Jared Polis is ""closely monitoring the situation,"" he said in a statement on Sunday.

""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation. More information will be provided as it becomes available,"" Polis added.

President Donald Trump was briefed on the attack, a White House official has told CNN.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the suspect had ""illegally overstayed"" a tourist visa.

""He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa,"" Miller wrote in a post on X. ""In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit.""

Miller characterized the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, as an ""illegal alien.""

Law enforcement sources previously told CNN that the suspect had applied for asylum and been rejected for a visa in 2005. It was unclear how and when the suspect entered the US.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for information about the suspect's immigration status.

Attack follows killing of two Israeli embassy staffers

The Boulder attack comes a little over a week after the fatal shooting of two staffers at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC.

The accused gunman, Elias Rodriguez, faces several federal murder charges, after authorities say he shot Sarah Milgrim, 26, and Yaron Lischinsky, 30, as they left an event at the Jewish Museum.

Rodriguez reportedly shouted ""Free Palestine"" as he was arrested. The US Department of Justice is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism. Both attacks come amid heightened tensions in the US during Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.

Speaking at Sunday's news conference after the Boulder attack, the FBI's Michalek said, ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country.""

""This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation.""

The New York Police Department said its presence has been increased at synagogues and other religious sites throughout New York City for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, following Sunday's anti-Semitic attack in Boulder.

That included ""high visibility patrols and heavy weapons terms,"" the Department announced in a post on X. Shavuot began Sunday evening.

Increased NYPD patrols have been sent to synagogues and mosques on multiple occasions since the start of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, on 7 October, 2023.

New York state is home to the largest population of Jews outside of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while also boasting one of the country's largest populations of Arabs and Muslims. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security had previously reported increased reports of anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, and anti-Arab threats following the start of the war.","A man reportedly threw bottles containing flammable liquid at a demonstration in Boulder, Colorado."

The FBI said it was investigating a “targeted terror attack” in Colorado after Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device at a group of demonstrators calling for the release of hostages in Gaza.

Boulder Police said eight people aged 52 to 88 were wounded in the incident. All victims were taken to hospitals in Boulder and the Denver metro area. At least one was in critical condition, while others suffered various injuries. The suspect was also hurt and taken to a hospital for examination.

“This attack happened at a regularly scheduled weekly peaceful event,” FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek said in a Sunday evening news conference. “The suspect was heard to yell, ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.”

Boulder Police chief Stephen Redfearn said the attack occurred on Pearl Street–a pedestrian mall–where several callers reported an armed man around 1:26 p.m.

“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act is unacceptable.”

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino added: ""We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence.""

Colorado Governor Jared Polis is ""closely monitoring the situation,"" he said in a statement on Sunday.

""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation. More information will be provided as it becomes available,"" Polis added.

President Donald Trump was briefed on the attack, a White House official has told CNN.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the suspect had ""illegally overstayed"" a tourist visa.

""He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa,"" Miller wrote in a post on X. ""In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit.""

Miller characterized the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, as an ""illegal alien.""

Law enforcement sources previously told CNN that the suspect had applied for asylum and been rejected for a visa in 2005. It was unclear how and when the suspect entered the US.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for information about the suspect's immigration status.

Attack follows killing of two Israeli embassy staffers

The Boulder attack comes a little over a week after the fatal shooting of two staffers at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC.

The accused gunman, Elias Rodriguez, faces several federal murder charges, after authorities say he shot Sarah Milgrim, 26, and Yaron Lischinsky, 30, as they left an event at the Jewish Museum.

Rodriguez reportedly shouted ""Free Palestine"" as he was arrested. The US Department of Justice is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism. Both attacks come amid heightened tensions in the US during Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.

Speaking at Sunday's news conference after the Boulder attack, the FBI's Michalek said, ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country.""

""This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation.""

The New York Police Department said its presence has been increased at synagogues and other religious sites throughout New York City for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, following Sunday's anti-Semitic attack in Boulder.

That included ""high visibility patrols and heavy weapons terms,"" the Department announced in a post on X. Shavuot began Sunday evening.

Increased NYPD patrols have been sent to synagogues and mosques on multiple occasions since the start of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, on 7 October, 2023.

New York state is home to the largest population of Jews outside of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while also boasting one of the country's largest populations of Arabs and Muslims. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security had previously reported increased reports of anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, and anti-Arab threats following the start of the war.","A man reportedly threw bottles containing flammable liquid at a demonstration in Boulder, Colorado."

FBI Director Kash Patel substantiated the nature of the incident shortly after 5.20pm local time, announcing:

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.""

Eyewitness accounts to CBS Colorado described a suspect lobbing Molotov cocktails at attendees of a serene gathering in support of Israeli hostages still captive in Gaza.

Boulder Police have declared that multiple sections of Pearl Street Mall have been cordoned off, reports Birmingham Live.

It is understood that the attacker zeroed in on the demonstration occurring along 13th Street and Pearl Street, with officials affirming multiple individuals were injured in the aggression.

Locals have been cautioned to eschew the vicinity stretching from Walnut to Pine Streets amid the ongoing probe.

Colorado's Governor Jared Polis has expressed his vigilance over the situation, issuing a communique.

""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,"" he remarked.

The specific event that was targeted has been identified as 'Run For Their Lives', which kicked off at 1pm local time at the intersection of Pearl Street and 8th Street.

The congregants stressed that their aim wasn't to stage a protest but to express ""solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.""

A remark from Run For Their Lives conveyed the nature of the event stating:.

""This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.""

Photos captured on-site depict paramedics attending to casualties and at the very least, one individual being stretchered away.

The FBI said it was investigating a “targeted terror attack” in Colorado after Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device at a group of demonstrators calling for the release of hostages in Gaza.

Boulder Police said eight people aged 52 to 88 were wounded in the incident. All victims were taken to hospitals in Boulder and the Denver metro area. At least one was in critical condition, while others suffered various injuries. The suspect was also hurt and taken to a hospital for examination.

“This attack happened at a regularly scheduled weekly peaceful event,” FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek said in a Sunday evening news conference. “The suspect was heard to yell, ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.”

Boulder Police chief Stephen Redfearn said the attack occurred on Pearl Street–a pedestrian mall–where several callers reported an armed man around 1:26 p.m.

“The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” he said. “This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act is unacceptable.”

FBI Director Kash Patel said agents and local law enforcement were at the scene “fully investigating a targeted terror attack.”

Redfearn said the pro-Israel demonstration is held frequently on Pearl Street Mall.

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted as an act of terrorism,” Michalek said.

Boulder’s Jewish Community said in a statement that the demonstrators were participating in the Run for Their Lives Walk, a movement raising awareness and calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas.

“Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured,” the Jewish group said. “When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.”

Colorado Governor Jared Polis said he was monitoring the situation.

“My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror,” he wrote on X. “Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”

State Secretary Marco Rubio offered up prayers for the victims, adding that “terror has no place in our great country.”

A suspect is in custody and police are investigating what FBI officials immediately called ""a targeted terror attack"" - though the local authorities said it was too early to define the attack.

""When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims ... with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,"" Boulder police chief Stephen Redfearn said on Sunday (US time).

The man threw bottles that apparently contained flammable liquid that hit the ground and exploded in flames, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told CNN, noting the exact number of bottles was unclear.

The reported attack took place at the Boulder Run for Their Lives event, the Anti-Defamation League said on social media. The weekly gathering of Jewish community members is meant to support the hostages taken during the 7 October attacks in Israel, in 2023.

The ADL noted that the incident happened ahead of the holiday of Shavuot, according to the ADL - a Jewish holiday which celebrates the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people on Mount Sinai.

The eight injured include four women and four men, ages 52 to 88, who were taken to hospitals in the Denver metro area, Boulder police said.

One victim was ""very seriously injured,"" according to Redfearn. Four victims were taken to Boulder Community Hospital. Two victims were airlifted to the Denver metro area, the chief said.

""Our thoughts are heavily focused on their recovery,"" he added.

""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza,"" Boulder's Jewish community said in a joint statement to CNN.

An eyewitness told CNN of seeing people whose pants were completely burned and singed off.

Brian H, who did not want to give his last name due to safety concerns, said he and his family were dining outside when a woman ran from the nearby Boulder courthouse to warn them a man was throwing fire at people.

Brian said he ran into the courtyard, where he said he saw a man carrying a tank on his back that resembled a gardening chemical sprayer.

""I saw fabric coming out of it, and I quickly realised that it was a Molotov cocktail. One had already exploded right in front of us,"" Brian said.

He saw another man trying to talk the suspect down, but the suspect kept yelling, ""F**k you, Zionist,"" ""You all deserve to die,"" and ""You've killed these children.""

""He was very erratic, shouting and spewing terrible things at different people,"" Brian said.

After calling 911, Brian went to help victims. He described seeing an elderly woman lying on the ground, unresponsive.

""There were several people attending to her and wrapping her up, trying to ensure she was ok,"" he said. While people from a restaurant were bringing large buckets of ice water to help extinguish the flames.

He said he grabbed a bucket and filled it with water from a fountain in the middle of the courtyard: ""I just kept filling that up and pouring it on their legs"".

Suspect reportedly yelled 'Free Palestine' during attack and used 'makeshift flamethrower' - police

CNN reported that Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was the suspect in the attack and reportedly used what authorities called ""a makeshift flamethrower"".

""This attack happened at a regularly scheduled, weekly peaceful event,"" FBI Denver Special Agent-in-Charge Mark D Michalek said during a news conference on Sunday.

""Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd.""

It is unclear if Soliman has an attorney at this time. Authorities said Soliman was injured during the attack and was taken to a hospital.

""The FBI shares in the sorrow of the Boulder community, especially to those who have family or friends injured in this tragedy,"" Michalek said.

""At this point, we do not believe that there is an additional suspect at large,"" Police Chief Redfearn said.

When asked if there was evidence the suspect acted as part of a ""greater network"" or specific group, Michalek said, ""Not at this time.""

""The subject is in custody, but this will be a thorough and complete investigation, and those checks are ongoing,"" Michalek said.

Witness describes seeing a 'big fire go up' after attack

A witness to the attack described seeing a ""big fire go up"", they told Colorado TV station KUSA.

Brooke Coffman said she was on the phone with her mother during her lunch break, approximately 100 to 150 feet away from the Boulder courthouse, when she ""saw some flags moving around,"" ""people wrestling,"" and ""like someone was getting beat up or something.""

When she saw the flames, Coffman said she hung up on her mother, ran over to the area and called 911.

""There was a kid yelling, 'Call 911,'"" Coffman recalled. ""People on the street were just yelling, 'Call 911.' People were running.""

Coffman told KUSA she jumped over a small fence to get to two women who were ""rolling around a bit"" on the grass and in their underwear from stripping off their pants.

She asked how she could help and saw how extensive their burns were.

""They have really bad burns all up on their legs,"" she said. One of the victims was screaming and ""was wrapped in a flag.""

""It just wasn't a good scene and she was, definitely needed help,"" she said. ""It was just not obviously a good thing to see.""

At least six people have been burned in a “targeted terror attack” in Colorado’s Boulder at Park Street Mall during a rally for Israeli hostages in Gaza. The suspect used a makeshift flamethrower during the attack and yelled “free Palestine”, an official said. The FBI director immediately described it as act of terror and said that federal agents have joined local law enforcement on the scene.

The suspect who has been taken into custody, has been identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the Denver field office.

What do we know of the attack?

The incident occurred at the well-known Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder, a four-block stretch where demonstrators from a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives had gathered. The group was holding a march to raise awareness about hostages still being held in Gaza, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Video from the attack site showed a witness shouting, “He is right there. He is throwing Molotov cocktails.” A police officer was seen with his gun drawn advancing on a bare-chested suspect with containers in each hand.

Even though no charges were immediately announced, officials said they expect to hold the 45-year-old ""fully accountable.” Soliman who was also injured during the attack was taken to a hospital, however authorities did not detail on his injuries.

FBI officials in Washington have confirmed they are treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism. The Justice Department condemned the assault as a “needless act of violence,” noting it comes amid a rise in attacks targeting Jewish Americans.

FBI Director Kash Patel in a post on X said, ""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.""

""This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,"" FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said.

Following the attack, police evacuated several blocks of the pedestrian mall, as law enforcement officers, including a K-9 unit, swept the area for potential threats and urged the public to avoid the vicinity.

The FBI has now formerly identified Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the suspect in the horrifying attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon.

The terrifying incident saw six victims — aged between 67 and 88 — rushed to hospital after Soliman used a “makeshift flamethrower” and hurled “an incendiary device” into a crowd, according to the FBI.

At a press conference FBI's special agent Mark Michalek confirmed the suspect was heard shouting “Free Palestine” during the assault. Mr Michalek also confirmed ""In the coming days decisions will be made about what charges to file and where, there 's a couple of different options. but what I would stress now is that we are fully united 100% in making sure the charges we bring hold the attacker fully accountable.""

The attack targeted participants of Run for Their Lives, an American Jewish group that organises public walks to call for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas. The groups meet once a week for a 1km walk wearing red T-shirts. They also carry national flags of the citizens who are among the hostages still held in Gaza.

Boulder's Jewish community released a joint statement, which reads: ""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.

""Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another. Strength to you all.""

Of the six victims who were injured in the chaos, on was described as being in a critical condition. The suspect, Soliman, was also injured in the incident.

A significant police and FBI presence remains in place, with local, state and federal agencies actively investigating.

FBI Director Kash Patel referred to the shocking act as a “targeted terror attack” in a post on X. However, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn struck a more cautious tone at an earlier press briefing, saying: “It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on.”

In shocking footage taken just moments after the attack the suspect was seen lying face-down on the grass, handcuffed by police without apparent resistance. He reportedly yelled at bystanders before surrendering to armed officers who ordered him to the ground.

Police chief Stephen Redfearn also said he was ""fairly confident"" that there was ""not an additional suspect at large"". He said that the police had received reports of ""differing descriptions"", but after speaking to witnesses, the police believe they have the lone suspect in custody.

The FBI is investigating a “targeted terror attack” Sunday involving people, some of whom may be Jewish, being set on fire with Molotov cocktails at a mall in Boulder, Colorado.

The incident took place during an event supporting hostages taken Oct. 7, 2023, by the Islamic terror group Hamas leaving more than 1,200 people in Israel dead.

FBI Director Kash Patel said on X: “We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.”

Dan Bongino, the bureau’s deputy director, added: “This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts.”

Reports from the scene at the Pearl Street Mall indicate a shirtless man with an accent yelling “Free Palestine” was setting individuals ablaze.

The suspect is identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman who was arrested at the scene.

Bill Melugin of Fox News is reporting Soliman is an illegal alien from Egypt.

“Three senior DHS sources tell @FoxNews that the Boulder terror suspect is an Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally as a visa overstay who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration,” Melugin posted on X.

“I’m told Mohamed Sabry Soliman arrived at LAX on 8/27/22 on a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through 2/26/23, but he overstayed & never left.

“I’m told on 9/29/22, he filed some sort of claim with USCIS, potentially an asylum claim, and on 3/29/23, USCIS under the Biden admin gave him work authorization, which expired on 3/28/25.”

“There’s a woman who was on the ground bleeding out. And then there are two other women whose calves were burned from the fire,” one witness told Fox News. “And so I just ran over to stay with them and make sure that they didn’t lose too much blood from their legs.”

Another witness said: “There was a woman that was burning on the ground. We noticed two other people that had also been affected by the burns on their legs. And this man was shirtless and was yelling with some kind of accent and was threatening to burn people.”

Officials say eight people, ages 52 to 88, were injured by fire, one seriously.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn is actually contradicting the FBI director, as he told local media: “I’ve been in contact with our local FBI multiple times … We are not calling it a terror attack at this point. Again, it’s way too early to speculate motive. I know there’s a lot out there on social media, but I ask people to give us just little bit of patience while we work through a really complex scene.”

“This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street, and this act is unacceptable,” he said. “I ask that you join me in thinking about our victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.

The FBI is investigating a “targeted terror attack” Sunday involving people, some of whom may be Jewish, being set on fire with Molotov cocktails at a mall in Boulder, Colorado.

The incident took place during an event supporting hostages taken Oct. 7, 2023, by the Islamic terror group Hamas leaving more than 1,200 people in Israel dead.

FBI Director Kash Patel said on X: “We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.”

Dan Bongino, the bureau’s deputy director, added: “This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts.”

Reports from the scene at the Pearl Street Mall indicate a shirtless man with an accent yelling “Free Palestine” was setting individuals ablaze.

The suspect is identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman who was arrested at the scene.

Bill Melugin of Fox News is reporting Soliman is an illegal alien from Egypt.

“Three senior DHS sources tell @FoxNews that the Boulder terror suspect is an Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally as a visa overstay who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration,” Melugin posted on X.

“I’m told Mohamed Sabry Soliman arrived at LAX on 8/27/22 on a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through 2/26/23, but he overstayed & never left.

“I’m told on 9/29/22, he filed some sort of claim with USCIS, potentially an asylum claim, and on 3/29/23, USCIS under the Biden admin gave him work authorization, which expired on 3/28/25.”

“There’s a woman who was on the ground bleeding out. And then there are two other women whose calves were burned from the fire,” one witness told Fox News. “And so I just ran over to stay with them and make sure that they didn’t lose too much blood from their legs.”

Another witness said: “There was a woman that was burning on the ground. We noticed two other people that had also been affected by the burns on their legs. And this man was shirtless and was yelling with some kind of accent and was threatening to burn people.”

Officials say eight people, ages 52 to 88, were injured by fire, one seriously.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn is actually contradicting the FBI director, as he told local media: “I’ve been in contact with our local FBI multiple times … We are not calling it a terror attack at this point. Again, it’s way too early to speculate motive. I know there’s a lot out there on social media, but I ask people to give us just little bit of patience while we work through a really complex scene.”

“This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street, and this act is unacceptable,” he said. “I ask that you join me in thinking about our victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy. Our hearts go out to them, and we are going to do everything we can to work as hard as we can throughout the evening to provide more information to get answers for everyone.”

FBI officials confirmed the suspect was heard shouting “Free Palestine” during the assault and assured the public that they will ""hold the attacker fully accountable""

The FBI has now formerly identified Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the suspect in the horrifying attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon.

The terrifying incident saw six victims — aged between 67 and 88 — rushed to hospital after Soliman used a “makeshift flamethrower” and hurled “an incendiary device” into a crowd, according to the FBI.

At a press conference FBI's special agent Mark Michalek confirmed the suspect was heard shouting “Free Palestine” during the assault. Mr Michalek also confirmed ""In the coming days decisions will be made about what charges to file and where, there 's a couple of different options. but what I would stress now is that we are fully united 100% in making sure the charges we bring hold the attacker fully accountable.""

The attack targeted participants of Run for Their Lives, an American Jewish group that organises public walks to call for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas. The groups meet once a week for a 1km walk wearing red T-shirts. They also carry national flags of the citizens who are among the hostages still held in Gaza.

Boulder's Jewish community released a joint statement, which reads: ""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.

""Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another. Strength to you all.""

Of the six victims who were injured in the chaos, on was described as being in a critical condition. The suspect, Soliman, was also injured in the incident.

A significant police and FBI presence remains in place, with local, state and federal agencies actively investigating.

FBI Director Kash Patel referred to the shocking act as a “targeted terror attack” in a post on X. However, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn struck a more cautious tone at an earlier press briefing, saying: “It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on.”

In shocking footage taken just moments after the attack the suspect was seen lying face-down on the grass, handcuffed by police without apparent resistance. He reportedly yelled at bystanders before surrendering to armed officers who ordered him to the ground.

Police chief Stephen Redfearn also said he was ""fairly confident"" that there was ""not an additional suspect at large"". He said that the police had received reports of ""differing descriptions"", but after speaking to witnesses, the police believe they have the lone suspect in custody.

The attack happened around 1:30 p.m. in the area of the historic courthouse at 1235 Pearl St. Law enforcement initially said six victims were taken to hospitals. On Sunday night, Boulder police said after receiving updated information, they have now identified eight victims -- four women and four men between ages 52 and 88.

Miri Kornfeld, an organizer with a group that holds weekly walks to raise awareness of Israeli hostages, told 9NEWS the group was walking on Pearl Street on Sunday afternoon. When they arrived at the courthouse, a man was waiting there with bottles, Kornfeld said. He threw the bottles, and multiple people were burned, including one woman who was badly burned and had to roll on the ground to put the fire out, she said.

People on the scene pointed out the suspect to officers, Redfearn said, and he was taken into custody without incident. He was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, Redfearn said.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,"" Patel said in the post.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence, and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Michalek said. ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country. This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation.""

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.""

“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon, and my wife Andrea and I are praying for the victims,"" Neguse said. ""Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence. We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”","Witnesses reported the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd, the FBI said."

Several people were injured in an attack at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said on Sunday.

The attack occurred at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall known for attracting tourists and college students, where a rally in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza was taking place.

The suspect was identified as a 45-year-old who shouted ""Free Palestine"" and used makeshift incendiary devices in the attack, said Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office.

The suspect was taken into custody at the scene.

On Monday, he was charged with a federal hate crime for the attack. He faces other charges including assault and the use of explosives. The US Department of Homeland Security said Monday that the man had entered the US on a tourist visa in 2022 and was in the country ""illegally.""

The FBI said Monday the suspect said he plotted the attack for a year.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals after the attack, Boulder police said.

The suspect was also injured and taken to the hospital, but authorities didn't elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved. ""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

'Terror has no place' in the United States, says Rubio

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio took to X to denounce the attack.

""We're united in prayer for the victims of a targeted terror attack this afternoon in Boulder,"" Rubio posted. ""Terror has no place in our great country.""

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that the attack occurred at Sunday's ""Boulder Run for Their Lives"" event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community to remember and raise visibility for the Israeli hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was ""shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews."" In a post on social media, he described it as ""antisemitism, fueled by the blood libels spread in the media."" without elaborating.

US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said he was closely monitoring the situation. ""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.""

The attack comes over a week after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect who shouted ""Free Palestine"" was taken into custody by police.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis posted on social media that it was ""unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder.""

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in New York also expressed outrage at the attack. ""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border — it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

""Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages.

An FBI spokesman, speaking at a press conference at 6:40 p.m. Mountain Time, confirmed that six victims, ages 67 to 88, had been transported to local hospitals. The attack took place around 1:26 p.m. Mountain.

Police apprehended the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, after the attack. Soliman entered the U.S. during the Biden administration and was in the country illegally after overstaying his visa, according to Fox News. An FBI spokesman confirmed eyewitness reports that Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an “incendiary device” into a crowd. He also said the suspect yelled, “Free Palestine” during the attack.

“We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,” FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X. “Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.”

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn confirmed that an assailant appeared to set people on fire at around 1:26 p.m. mountain time. He declined to identify it as a terror attack, however.

“We are not calling it a terror attack at this point, it’s way too early to speculate motive,” he told reporters in a news conference.

Boulder dispatch received calls to the effect that “there was a man with a weapon and people were being set on fire,” the chief said.

“There was a group of pro-Israel people that were there in a peaceful demonstration” on Pearl Street in downtown Boulder, he said. “We encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.”

Eyewitnesses speaking to CBS News described the incendiary device as a “Molotov cocktail,” a makeshift bomb.

Run For Their Lives, the group that organized the pro-Israel walk, has distinguished the walk from a protest.

“This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release,” the group said, CBS News reported. The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the outdoor Pearl Street Mall and back.

“I am closely monitoring the situation in Boulder, and my thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror,” Gov. Jared Polis, D-Colo., posted on X. “Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”

“While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation,” Polis added. “More information will be provided as it becomes available.”

“FBI personnel are on the scene in Boulder, Colorado, along with local law enforcement,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino wrote on X. “We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence.”

“All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation,” he added. “If you have any investigative tips please contact the FBI. And if you aided or abetted this attack, we will find you. You cannot hide.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced that her office is working with the FBI and local law enforcement to investigate that attack.

Fox News’ Bill Melugin said three sources at the Department of Homeland Security told him Soliman is an Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally.

Soliman arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, on a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through Feb. 26, 2023, but he overstayed, Melugin said the sources told him. Also according to Melugin’s sources, the office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under President Joe Biden gave Soliman a work authorization that expired on March 28, 2025.

FBI officials confirmed the suspect was heard shouting “Free Palestine” during the assault and assured the public that they will ""hold the attacker fully accountable""

The FBI has now formerly identified Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the suspect in the horrifying attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon.

The terrifying incident saw six victims — aged between 67 and 88 — rushed to hospital after Soliman used a “makeshift flamethrower” and hurled “an incendiary device” into a crowd, according to the FBI.

At a press conference FBI's special agent Mark Michalek confirmed the suspect was heard shouting “Free Palestine” during the assault. Mr Michalek also confirmed ""In the coming days decisions will be made about what charges to file and where, there 's a couple of different options. but what I would stress now is that we are fully united 100% in making sure the charges we bring hold the attacker fully accountable.""

The attack targeted participants of Run for Their Lives, an American Jewish group that organises public walks to call for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas. The groups meet once a week for a 1km walk wearing red T-shirts. They also carry national flags of the citizens who are among the hostages still held in Gaza.

Boulder's Jewish community released a joint statement, which reads: ""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.

""Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another. Strength to you all.""

Of the six victims who were injured in the chaos, on was described as being in a critical condition. The suspect, Soliman, was also injured in the incident.

A significant police and FBI presence remains in place, with local, state and federal agencies actively investigating.

FBI Director Kash Patel referred to the shocking act as a “targeted terror attack” in a post on X. However, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn struck a more cautious tone at an earlier press briefing, saying: “It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on.”

In shocking footage taken just moments after the attack the suspect was seen lying face-down on the grass, handcuffed by police without apparent resistance. He reportedly yelled at bystanders before surrendering to armed officers who ordered him to the ground.

Police chief Stephen Redfearn also said he was ""fairly confident"" that there was ""not an additional suspect at large"". He said that the police had received reports of ""differing descriptions"", but after speaking to witnesses, the police believe they have the lone suspect in custody.

The attack happened around 1:30 p.m. in the area of the historic courthouse at 1235 Pearl St. Law enforcement initially said six victims were taken to hospitals. On Sunday night, Boulder police said after receiving updated information, they have now identified eight victims -- four women and four men between ages 52 and 88.

Miri Kornfeld, an organizer with a group that holds weekly walks to raise awareness of Israeli hostages, told 9NEWS the group was walking on Pearl Street on Sunday afternoon. When they arrived at the courthouse, a man was waiting there with bottles, Kornfeld said. He threw the bottles, and multiple people were burned, including one woman who was badly burned and had to roll on the ground to put the fire out, she said.

People on the scene pointed out the suspect to officers, Redfearn said, and he was taken into custody without incident. He was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, Redfearn said.

A violent attack occurred in Boulder, Colorado, where a man wielding Molotov cocktails injured at least six people at a gathering aimed at remembering Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, reportedly shouted, 'Free Palestine' during the assault and has been taken into custody by the authorities.

The attack in Boulder comes at a time when tensions in the United States are rising due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas. Antisemitic hate crimes have reportedly increased, accompanied by heated debates between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian groups.

These tensions are further exacerbated by the Trump administration's stance, which has labelled many pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, leading to significant controversy.

Recent violence in Washington, D.C., involved a shooting that resulted in the death of two individuals. These developments underscore a volatile atmosphere in the US, where issues of international conflicts are increasingly manifesting in domestic incidents.

The Boulder attack prompted the evacuation of several blocks near Pearl Street, as law enforcement searched for additional threats. Witnesses reported the suspect 'setting people on fire,' reflecting the harrowing nature of the attack. Despite the tense situation, police confirmed no other suspects remain at large.

Several people were injured in an attack at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said on Sunday.

The attack occurred at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall known for attracting tourists and college students, where a rally in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza was taking place.

The suspect was identified as a 45-year-old who shouted ""Free Palestine"" and used makeshift incendiary devices in the attack, said Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office.

The suspect was taken into custody at the scene.

On Monday, he was charged with a federal hate crime for the attack. He faces other charges including assault and the use of explosives. The US Department of Homeland Security said Monday that the man had entered the US on a tourist visa in 2022 and was in the country ""illegally.""

The FBI said Monday the suspect said he plotted the attack for a year.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals after the attack, Boulder police said.

The suspect was also injured and taken to the hospital, but authorities didn't elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved. ""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

""This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act was unacceptable,"" Redfearn said at an earlier press conference. ""I ask that you join me in thinking about the victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.""

""We are fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,"" FBI Director Kash Patel said on X.

'Terror has no place' in the United States, says Rubio

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio took to X to denounce the attack.

""We're united in prayer for the victims of a targeted terror attack this afternoon in Boulder,"" Rubio posted. ""Terror has no place in our great country.""

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that the attack occurred at Sunday's ""Boulder Run for Their Lives"" event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community to remember and raise visibility for the Israeli hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was ""shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews."" In a post on social media, he described it as ""antisemitism, fueled by the blood libels spread in the media."" without elaborating.

US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said he was closely monitoring the situation. ""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.""

The attack comes over a week after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect who shouted ""Free Palestine"" was taken into custody by police.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis posted on social media that it was ""unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder.""

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in New York also expressed outrage at the attack. ""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border — it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

""Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing a Molotov cocktails at them,"" he said.

Eight people were injured, some with burns.

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was booked into the Boulder County jail north of Denver and expected to face charges in connection with the attack the FBI was investigating as a terrorist act. Online records did not immediately show when he would make a court appearance.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said.

Across the U.S., the New York Police Department said it has upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

Suspect reemerged after initial attack before being arrested

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

As people tried to help the woman on the ground, another woman who appeared to be a participant in the event yelled to others out of the camera’s view, defending their cause, saying they don’t talk about the government but just talk about the hostages.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then ""two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Segal, who said she is Jewish on her father’s side and has supported the Palestinian cause for more than 40 years, was concerned that she might be accused of helping the suspect because she was wearing a pro-Palestinian shirt.

“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” she said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”

Authorities say they believe the suspect acted alone

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.""

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

This story has been updated to correct that 10 people, not four, were killed in the Boulder grocery store shooting.

Soliman was allegedly heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was ""clear this is a targeted act of violence"" and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.

Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts, including attempted murder, and a federal hate crimes charge.

Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, the Department of Homeland Security said. That original visa expired in February 2023, and he had applied for asylum. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.

The FBI said later Sunday night it was ""conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder"" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.

Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts and a federal hate crimes charge.

The walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also yelled ""End Zionist!"" during the attack.

Police said the victims included eight women and seven men, whose ages range from 25 to 88. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be ""safe to say"" that person was in critical condition.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a ""very loving person."" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.

The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.

UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.

Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.

Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday's event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said FBI agents were at the scene Sunday afternoon.

U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi released a statement Monday after the federal charge was filed. ""The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Our prayers are with the victims and our Jewish community across the world,"" she said.

Bondi added, ""This vile anti-Semitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC,"" referring to the fatal shooting of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21. ""We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.""

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media that the ""National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,"" according to the Reuters news agency.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a ""heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.""

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" Polis said. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Run for Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, ""This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release."" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk.

Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.

""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,"" said Victor.

Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.

""I saw the aftermath,"" said street performer Peter Irish. ""It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.""

University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, ""My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.""

We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed. Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured. We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon:","A suspect is in custody after what authorities call a ""targeted act of violence"" at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado.

It’s not an exaggeration. It’s a fact. An elderly woman was burned in the assault. The suspect, Mohamad Soliman, crashed the event, screaming, “This will end when Palestine is free,” and began hurling incendiary devices everywhere.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation under Kash Patel rightly called this a targeted terror attack. The bureau is no longer under the confines of woke nonsense, running interference for Democrats, or going after the political enemies of Joe Biden. Those days are over, and the media and the political class are unhappy about it. CNN had a total meltdown over this declaration, with, and you cannot make this up, disgraced former deputy director Andrew McCabe emerging from his darkened lair to pile on why a man burning Jews and declaring ‘it won’t stop until Palestine is free’ shouldn’t be considered a terror attack outright.

When someone yells, ""End zionists,"" and then sets them on fire, maybe that's a terrorist attack. I don't know. McCabe has lied so many times that he doesn't know the truth anymore. Also, check out how NBC and CBS News framed this terror attack. Guy framed it perfectly: it's ""anti-journalism.""

The liberal media is about to have their own hell week. Democrats had it over Joe Biden's declining health and the subsequent cover-up. Now, the media is going to twist itself into pretzels explaining how throwing Molotov cocktails at Jews isn't an act of terrorism.",

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said.

Across the U.S., the New York Police Department said it has upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

Suspect reemerged after initial attack before being arrested

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

As people tried to help the woman on the ground, another woman who appeared to be a participant in the event yelled to others out of the camera’s view, defending their cause, saying they don’t talk about the government but just talk about the hostages.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then ""two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Segal, who said she is Jewish on her father’s side and has supported the Palestinian cause for more than 40 years, was concerned that she might be accused of helping the suspect because she was wearing a pro-Palestinian shirt.

“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” she said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”

Authorities say they believe the suspect acted alone

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.""

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

This story has been updated to correct that 10 people, not four, were killed in the Boulder grocery store shooting.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said.

Across the U.S., the New York Police Department said it has upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

Suspect reemerged after initial attack before being arrested

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

As people tried to help the woman on the ground, another woman who appeared to be a participant in the event yelled to others out of the camera’s view, defending their cause, saying they don’t talk about the government but just talk about the hostages.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then ""two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Segal, who said she is Jewish on her father’s side and has supported the Palestinian cause for more than 40 years, was concerned that she might be accused of helping the suspect because she was wearing a pro-Palestinian shirt.

“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” she said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”

Authorities say they believe the suspect acted alone

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.""

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

This story has been updated to correct that 10 people, not four, were killed in the Boulder grocery store shooting.

According to the report, Mohamed Sabry Soliman arrived at LAX on 8/27/22 on a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through 2/26/23, but he overstayed & never left.

Then, on 9/29/22, he filed some sort of claim with USCIS, potentially an asylum claim, and on 3/29/23, USCIS under the Biden admin gave him work authorization, which expired on 3/28/25.

Police said a male suspect was taken into custody after a Sunday afternoon attack that ""set people on fire"" in Boulder, Colorado, in what the FBI director described as a ""targeted"" act of terror.

Authorities identified the attacker who threw a Molotov cocktail at a pro-Israel march in Boulder, injuring multiple people, and whom MSNBC described only as a ""white male""...

Information on the attack, which occurred near a walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza, was “very preliminary,” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said. But he noted the man was apprehended following calls to police dispatch of someone with a weapon who was “setting people on fire.”

While FBI heads Kash Patel and Dan Bongino described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" Redfearn stressed it was too soon to speculate about a motive.

“We are not calling it a terror attack at this moment,” Redfearn said. “This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act was unacceptable,” he said. “I ask that you join me in thinking about the victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.”

The attack follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza,"" a statement attributed to Boulder’s Jewish Community said.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis posted on social media that he was closely monitoring the situation, adding that ""hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.""",

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who reportedly overstayed a US visa after arriving in 2022, was identified as the suspect in a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado.

At least six people were injured in what the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) immediately described as a “targeted terror attack"" at the Pearl Street outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado.

The group targeted by the suspect, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, had gathered to raise attention to Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Soliman yelled “Free Palestine"" and used a makeshift flamethrower in the attack, said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the Denver field office.

Soliman was later taken into custody.

According to US President Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, Soliman had overstayed his visa in the United States and had been allowed to work by the previous administration.

Multiple media reports suggest Soliman is an Egyptian native. However, an official confirmation on the same was awaited.

Reports also suggested Soliman had arrived in the United States on a B-2 visa in August 2022.

More details on his home and family were not immediately available.

Soliman was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

The attack took place at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, where demonstrators with a volunteer group called ‘Run For Their Lives’ had gathered to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza.

It occurred more than a week after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington by a Chicago man who yelled, “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza"" as he was being led away by police.

Tensions in the United States over Israel’s war in Gaza have recently heightened, spurring an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel, led by Donald Trump, to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic.

Trump’s administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite US universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

Meanwhile, FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department — which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations — decried the attack as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans"".

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,"" FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

According to journalist Collin Rugg, citing Fox News’ Bill Melugin, Soliman entered the US on August 27, 2022, through Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) during the Biden administration. “The Boulder terror suspect is an Egyptian national in the US illegally as a visa overstay who entered the US during the Biden administration,” Melugin reported.Mohamed Sabry Soliman, described by authorities as the man behind Sunday’s attack, is reportedly a foreign national who overstayed his visa after arriving in the US two years ago. While the FBI confirmed his Egyptian nationality, journalist Laura Loomer has claimed that Soliman is originally an immigrant from Kuwait who entered under what she called “Joe Biden’s open border policies.”In a post on X, Loomer alleged, “Mohamad Soliman, the Muslim man who carried out the Islamic terrorist attack in Colorado today, appears to be an immigrant from Kuwait who recently arrived in the US under Joe Biden’s open border policies 2 years ago.”Loomer also said a professional profile matching Soliman's name and appearance suggested he worked in finance, digital marketing, and international financial reporting. She further claimed he has a daughter studying in Colorado.Eyewitness Brooke Coffman, 19, described the chaotic aftermath: “Everybody is yelling, ‘get water, get water,’” she said, recalling seeing four women with burns, one of them wrapped in a flag. A video from the scene shows a shirtless man—believed to be Soliman—holding spray bottles as flames burn on the ground. He is heard shouting, “End Zionists!”, “Palestine is Free!” and “They are killers!” at people trying to assist the injured.Also read: 'Targeted terror attack': Man attacks crowd with firebombs in Colorado, several injured The attack took place during a gathering organised by ‘Run For Their Lives’, a global initiative advocating for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

At least six people were injured in an attack in Boulder, Colorado, US, on Sunday (local time), which the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism, officials said.

The suspect of the “targeted terror attack"" yelled “Free Palestine"" and used a makeshift flamethrower at a popular pedestrian mall in Boulder, where a group of Jewish protesters were calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. He was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, who was taken into custody.

The attack on the Jewish protesters comes as the latest in a series of antisemitic violence against the community amid the Israel-Hamas war. The incident comes days after two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot dead outside Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC.

Some people were seriously injured in the attack, while some others sustained minor wounds.

“We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,"" FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X.

Deputy Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Dan Bongino, said that the attack is being probed as an act of “ideologically motivated violence"" on the basis of preliminary information, evidence, and witness accounts.

According to the witnesses, a man threw an object similar to a homemade Molotov cocktail at the protesters who were peacefully demanding the release of Israeli hostages who have been held captive by Hamas, a group which is designated a terrorist organisation by the US.

The videos surfacing from the spot of the attack showed people in panic as they ran to safety.

Visuals from the crime scene showed a shirtless man spreading his arms with spray bottles in his hand, walking back and forth as fire burned on the grass. He is heard yelling anti-Israel slogans like “End Zionists"", “Palestine is free"", and “They are killers"".

Israeli ambassador to the UN in New York condemned the attack, “Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border — it is already burning the streets of America.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that terror has no place in the United States.

“We’re united in prayer for the victims of a targeted terror attack this afternoon in Boulder. Terror has no place in our great country,"" he said on X.

Antisemitic violence has risen since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war after the October 7, 2023, attack.

According to the report, Mohamed Sabry Soliman arrived at LAX on 8/27/22 on a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through 2/26/23, but he overstayed & never left.

Then, on 9/29/22, he filed some sort of claim with USCIS, potentially an asylum claim, and on 3/29/23, USCIS under the Biden admin gave him work authorization, which expired on 3/28/25.

Police said a male suspect was taken into custody after a Sunday afternoon attack that ""set people on fire"" in Boulder, Colorado, in what the FBI director described as a ""targeted"" act of terror.

Authorities identified the attacker who threw a Molotov cocktail at a pro-Israel march in Boulder, injuring multiple people, and whom MSNBC described only as a ""white male""...

Information on the attack, which occurred near a walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza, was “very preliminary,” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said. But he noted the man was apprehended following calls to police dispatch of someone with a weapon who was “setting people on fire.”

While FBI heads Kash Patel and Dan Bongino described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" Redfearn stressed it was too soon to speculate about a motive.

“We are not calling it a terror attack at this moment,” Redfearn said. “This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act was unacceptable,” he said. “I ask that you join me in thinking about the victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.”

The attack follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza,"" a statement attributed to Boulder’s Jewish Community said.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis posted on social media that he was closely monitoring the situation, adding that ""hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.""",

Authorities identified the attacker who threw a Molotov cocktail at a pro-Israel march in Boulder, injuring multiple people, and whom MSNBC described only as a ""white male""...

Information on the attack, which occurred near a walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza, was “very preliminary,” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said. But he noted the man was apprehended following calls to police dispatch of someone with a weapon who was “setting people on fire.”

While FBI heads Kash Patel and Dan Bongino described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" Redfearn stressed it was too soon to speculate about a motive.

“We are not calling it a terror attack at this moment,” Redfearn said. “This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act was unacceptable,” he said. “I ask that you join me in thinking about the victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.”

The attack follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

In a post Sunday on X, Greenblatt connected the Sunday attack in Boulder, Colo.— which targeted a group of peaceful participants in a weekly walk to call for the return of hostages in Gaza — to the killing of a young couple outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., last month.

In both scenarios, the suspected perpetrators were heard to shout “free Palestine” during or after the attack.

“This is the second violent attack on the US Jewish community in two weeks,” Greenblatt wrote in a post on X. “First, a young couple slaughtered in DC. And now, a firebomb thrown at a group in Boulder, Colorado, as they gathered to express solidarity with the 58 hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists.”

“Two peaceful Jewish events that ended with rage-filled, violent attacks,” he added.

Greenblatt also pointed to recent examples of vandalism and violence against Jewish people in places around the world.

“We’re witnessing a global campaign of intimidation and terror deliberately directed against the Jewish people,” Greenblatt said, adding, “Sadly, none of this is surprising. In fact, it’s entirely predictable. This is precisely where anti-Jewish incitement leads. This is exactly what vicious anti-Zionism enables.”

His statement comes hours after six people were injured in the Colorado attack, which the FBI and local law enforcement are investigating as an act of terrorism.

A suspect in custody used a “makeshift flamethrower” and incendiary devices to attack the individuals and “was heard to yell ‘free Palestine,’ during the attack,” according to FBI special agent in charge Mark Michalek.

The victims, attending a regular weekly event, ranged in age from 67 to 88 and all are hospitalized, with two people having been airlifted to a burn unit.

Miri Kornfeld, an organizer with the Colorado chapter of the pro-Israel group StandWithUs, told local news that at least five people were injured in the attacks. Kornfeld described a scene of a shirtless man waiting for the marchers on a street corner outside a courthouse and throwing multiple bottles, which burst into flames.

At least one woman was badly burned and rolled on the ground to put the fire out, and two victims were flown by helicopter to the University of Colorado hospital’s burn unit.

The event had been staged by Run For Their Lives, an organization that hosts regular runs and walks across the country to draw attention to Israeli hostages and is affiliated with hostage families and their advocates in Israel. On its website, the group advises participants concerned about their safety to “focus on humanity” in their demonstrations, “don’t protest,” and to fly flags from all countries that have hostages in Gaza. The Boulder march had been staged weekly, organizers said.

Eric Fingerhut, president and CEO of Jewish Federations of North America, said in a statement that the attack “is another example of a wave of domestic terror attacks aimed at the Jewish community.” He urged President Donald Trump and Congress to allocate more funding for security at Jewish institutions.

An eyewitness account posted by a pro-Israel X user said that most of the victims were in their 70s. Video from the scene shared on social media showed smoke and people on the ground. Screaming was audible. Another video showed a shirtless man, holding spray bottles, yelling, “End Zionists.”

An adult male suspect was arrested but police declined to name him or speculate on his motive in the hours after the incident. Without offering details, FBI Director Kash Patel posted that his agency was investigating what he said was a “targeted terror attack.”

The incident took place shortly after 1 p.m. on the Pearl Street Mall in downtown Boulder, which hosts the city’s Run for Their Lives. The weekly walks are held in communities around the world to sustain attention to the hostages being held by Hamas.

It comes 10 days after a pro-Palestinian activist shot and killed two attendees of an event held at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.

“We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Our Lives walk on Pearl Street,” local Jewish leaders, including rabbis, said in a statement distributed by the Boulder Jewish Community Center. They added, “Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.”

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a press conference that the initial emergency call had said people were being set on fire and that multiple people had been transported to hospitals with injuries “fairly consistent” with that description. He said the injuries ranged from minor to severe and potentially life-threatening.

Redfearn confirmed that “a group of pro-Israel people” had been gathered in the area but said it was too early yet to say whether they had been targeted. He said that if an investigation shows that any group was targeted, the police department would seek to safeguard them in the future.

“I cannot confirm right now that this was targeted at a specific group of people,” he said. “We understand that there’s a lot of tensions right now and a lot of issues in the United States and everywhere. Once we have a clear motive, we will react accordingly. And if that motive was a group that’s targeted, we will absolutely step up and ensure that additional security, additional presence.”

Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack while referencing both the hostages and the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. He also linked the attack to the DC shootings.

“As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less,” Polis wrote on X. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.”",Multiple people were injured in Colorado in a firebombing attack on people who had gathered to draw attention to Israeli hostages.

Eight people were injured on Sunday when a 45-year-old man yelled ""Free Palestine"" and threw incendiary devices into a crowd in Boulder, Colorado where a demonstration to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place, authorities said.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said.

Michalek named the suspect as Mohamed Soliman, who was hospitalized shortly after the attack. Reuters could not immediately locate contact information for him or his family.

FBI Director Kash Patel also described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be ""a hate crime given the group that was targeted."" Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved.

""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel.

In a statement, the group said the walks have been held every week since then for the hostages, ""without any violent incidents until today.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law"".

""The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,"" he said.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel, led by President Donald Trump, to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. His administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite US universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

In a post to X, a social network, Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Soliman had overstayed his visa and been allowed to work by the previous administration. He said it was further evidence of the need to ""fully reverse"" what he described as ""suicidal migration.""

Reuters was not able to independently verify the suspect's immigration status. When asked about Soliman, the Department of Homeland Security said more information would be provided as it became available.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

""Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water,'"" Coffman said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said it was an antisemitic attack.

""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism,"" he said on X.

The attack follows last month's arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, DC Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fueled polarisation in the United States over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

Miri Kornfeld, an organizer with the Colorado chapter of the pro-Israel group StandWithUs, told local news that at least five people were injured in the attacks. Kornfeld described a scene of a shirtless man waiting for the marchers on a street corner outside a courthouse and throwing multiple bottles, which burst into flames.

At least one woman was badly burned and rolled on the ground to put the fire out, and two victims were flown by helicopter to the University of Colorado hospital’s burn unit.

The event had been staged by Run For Their Lives, an organization that hosts regular runs and walks across the country to draw attention to Israeli hostages and is affiliated with hostage families and their advocates in Israel. On its website, the group advises participants concerned about their safety to “focus on humanity” in their demonstrations, “don’t protest,” and to fly flags from all countries that have hostages in Gaza. The Boulder march had been staged weekly, organizers said.

Eric Fingerhut, president and CEO of Jewish Federations of North America, said in a statement that the attack “is another example of a wave of domestic terror attacks aimed at the Jewish community.” He urged President Donald Trump and Congress to allocate more funding for security at Jewish institutions.

An eyewitness account posted by a pro-Israel X user said that most of the victims were in their 70s. Video from the scene shared on social media showed smoke and people on the ground. Screaming was audible. Another video showed a shirtless man, holding spray bottles, yelling, “End Zionists.”

An adult male suspect was arrested but police declined to name him or speculate on his motive in the hours after the incident. Without offering details, FBI Director Kash Patel posted that his agency was investigating what he said was a “targeted terror attack.”

The incident took place shortly after 1 p.m. on the Pearl Street Mall in downtown Boulder, which hosts the city’s Run for Their Lives. The weekly walks are held in communities around the world to sustain attention to the hostages being held by Hamas.

It comes 10 days after a pro-Palestinian activist shot and killed two attendees of an event held at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.

“We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Our Lives walk on Pearl Street,” local Jewish leaders, including rabbis, said in a statement distributed by the Boulder Jewish Community Center. They added, “Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.”

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a press conference that the initial emergency call had said people were being set on fire and that multiple people had been transported to hospitals with injuries “fairly consistent” with that description. He said the injuries ranged from minor to severe and potentially life-threatening.

Redfearn confirmed that “a group of pro-Israel people” had been gathered in the area but said it was too early yet to say whether they had been targeted. He said that if an investigation shows that any group was targeted, the police department would seek to safeguard them in the future.

“I cannot confirm right now that this was targeted at a specific group of people,” he said. “We understand that there’s a lot of tensions right now and a lot of issues in the United States and everywhere. Once we have a clear motive, we will react accordingly. And if that motive was a group that’s targeted, we will absolutely step up and ensure that additional security, additional presence.”

Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack while referencing both the hostages and the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. He also linked the attack to the DC shootings.

“As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less,” Polis wrote on X. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.”",Multiple people were injured in Colorado in a firebombing attack on people who had gathered to draw attention to Israeli hostages.

(AP) — A man with a makeshift flamethrower yelled “Free Palestine” and hurled an incendiary device into a group that had assembled to raise attention for Israeli hostages in Gaza, law enforcement officials said Sunday. Eight people were injured, some with burns.

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was booked into the Boulder County jail north of Denver and expected to face charges in connection with the attack the FBI was investigating as a terrorist act. Online records did not immediately show when he would make a court appearance.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said.

Across the U.S., the New York Police Department said it has upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

As people tried to help the woman on the ground, another woman who appeared to be a participant in the event yelled to others out of the camera’s view, defending their cause, saying they don’t talk about the government but just talk about the hostages.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then ""two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Segal, who said she is Jewish on her father’s side and has supported Palestine for more than 40 years, was concerned that she might be accused of helping the suspect because she was wearing a pro-Palestine shirt.

“There were people who were burning, I wanted to help,” she said. “But I didn’t want to be associated with the perpetrator.”

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.""

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Several people were injured and some may have been set on fire at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said. Police said a man was taken into custody in the attack that the FBI immediately described as a “targeted terror attack.""

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters Sunday evening that it was too early to discuss a motive but that witnesses were being interviewed.

“It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on,” he said.

The Boulder attack took place at a popular pedestrian mall known for attracting tourists and college students. On Sunday, demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives had gathered to call for the release of hostages who remain in Gaza. The group has multiple chapters across the world that regularly meet to walk to advocate for hostage releases.

Sunday's attack also occurred as law enforcement authorities in the U.S. grapple with a spike in antisemitic violence. And last week, a man was arrested on charges in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers and shouted “Free Palestine” as he was being led away by police.

Boulder police said there were “several victims” in the attack. The injuries authorities found were consistent with reports of individuals being set on fire, Redfearn said, adding that injuries ranged from serious to minor.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the pedestrian mall.

“Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,” FBI Director Kash Patel posted on social media.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement that he was “closely monitoring” the situation, adding that “hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”","

The FBI has named the suspect in a horrifying attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon, where he allegedly used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and threw ""an incendiary device"" into a crowd

The FBI has identified Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the culprit behind a harrowing attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon.

In the violent spree, six people between the ages of 67 and 88 were rushed to hospital after Soliman deployed a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and hurled ""an incendiary device"" into a crowd, according to FBI statements. The lead FBI agent revealed that during the attack, the suspect was heard shouting ""Free Palestine"".

The assault targeted participants of Run for Their Lives, a Jewish American group that organises regular public walks to call for the immediate release of captives held by Hamas.

The chaos led to multiple injuries, with authorities indicating that the severity ranged from minor to more serious. Soliman also suffered injuries in the incident.

A substantial law enforcement presence is still on the scene, with ongoing collaboration between local, state, and federal agencies.

Initial witness statements offered a stark account, with one describing seeing ""a man with a weapon [was] lighting people on fire.""

FBI Director Kash Patel has slammed the vile act as a ""targeted terror attack"" in a statement on X. In contrast, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn took a cautious stance at an initial press briefing, saying: ""It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on.""

At a press conference, District Attorney Michael Dougherty said: ""In the coming days decisions will be made about what charges to file and where, there's a couple of different options. But what I would stress now is that we are fully united 100% in making sure the charges we bring hold the attacker fully accountable.""

The suspect was caught on camera sprawled out on the grass, pinned down by police.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser issued a statement saying: ""My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today's attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.""

The Attorney General continued: ""From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General's Office.

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views.

The FBI has named the suspect in a horrifying attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon, where he allegedly used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and threw ""an incendiary device"" into a crowd

The FBI has identified Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the culprit behind a harrowing attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon.

In the violent spree, six people between the ages of 67 and 88 were rushed to hospital after Soliman deployed a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and hurled ""an incendiary device"" into a crowd, according to FBI statements. The lead FBI agent revealed that during the attack, the suspect was heard shouting ""Free Palestine"".

The assault targeted participants of Run for Their Lives, a Jewish American group that organises regular public walks to call for the immediate release of captives held by Hamas.

The chaos led to multiple injuries, with authorities indicating that the severity ranged from minor to more serious. Soliman also suffered injuries in the incident.

A substantial law enforcement presence is still on the scene, with ongoing collaboration between local, state, and federal agencies.

Initial witness statements offered a stark account, with one describing seeing ""a man with a weapon [was] lighting people on fire.""

FBI Director Kash Patel has slammed the vile act as a ""targeted terror attack"" in a statement on X. In contrast, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn took a cautious stance at an initial press briefing, saying: ""It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on.""

At a press conference, District Attorney Michael Dougherty said: ""In the coming days decisions will be made about what charges to file and where, there's a couple of different options. But what I would stress now is that we are fully united 100% in making sure the charges we bring hold the attacker fully accountable.""

The suspect was caught on camera sprawled out on the grass, pinned down by police.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser issued a statement saying: ""My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today's attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.""

The Attorney General continued: ""From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General's Office.

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts-which are becoming more frequent, brazen and closer to home-must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.""

A suspect is in custody, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn confirmed during a Sunday news conference.

“When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,” Redfearn said.

The incident occurred during a peaceful pro-Israel demonstration, the chief made clear.

“This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street, and this act is unacceptable,” he said. “I ask that you join me in thinking about our victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy. Our hearts go out to them, and we are going to do everything we can to work as hard as we can throughout the evening to provide more information to get answers for everyone.”

CNN further reported the FBI was investigating the violence as a “targeted terror attack”:

The reported attack took place at the Boulder Run for Their Lives event, the Anti-Defamation League said on social media. The weekly gathering of Jewish community members is meant to support the hostages taken during the October 7 attacks in Israel in 2023. The incident happened ahead of the holiday of Shavuot, according to the ADL – a Jewish holiday which celebrates the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people on Mount Sinai.

FBI Director Kash Patel put out a statement about the incident.

“We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado,” Patel said. “Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.”

The ADL said in a statement, “We are aware of reports of an attack at today’s Boulder Run for Their Lives event – a weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages kidnapped on 10/7. ADL is monitoring the situation in Colorado as we approach the holiday of Shavuot.”

Commissioners from the seven states in the Colorado River Basin — Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, California and Nevada — must create a plan that will govern how those states divvy up the river’s water after the current guidelines expire at the end of 2026. As the river shrinks due to drought and climate change, the negotiators must decide who will take less water, and they need to do so in the next few months.

“The way the law of the river is set up, this is a decision that takes the seven states, and there are so many stakeholders and users who depend on that,” said Jennifer Pitt, Colorado River program director at the National Audubon Society. “We are really at their mercy, and we are just about out of time.”

The negotiators, who met in Las Vegas this week, have repeatedly said they are committed to finding a consensus solution, but have not yet done so and have already blown past previous deadlines set by federal authorities more than a year ago.

JB Hamby, California’s negotiator, said in an interview that the states have been meeting several times a month since December, when tensions between the states burst into public view during a conference. Both the frequency and the tenor of the meetings have since improved, he said.

“I think there’s a lot to be heartened by and the states are committed to working towards a solution,” Hamby said.

If the states cannot come to an agreement, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will implement its own plan. That outcome could prompt years of expensive litigation and put complicated water management questions in the hands of judges not specialized in the issues.

Litigation would create massive uncertainty in the basin and result in a decision that is not ideal for anyone, experts said.

Those who depend on the river are already dealing with uncertainty: this season’s mountain snowpack is expected to deliver about half the median amount of water to the system’s two major reservoirs, which are already two-thirds empty. Years of drought not balanced by decreases in water consumption have drained Lake Mead and Lake Powell, and aridification fueled by climate change is expected to continue to reduce the flow of the river that makes modern life possible across the Southwest.

The Colorado River irrigates more than 5 million acres of farmland — including water supplies for much of the nation’s winter vegetables — and comprises large portions of many Western cities’ water portfolio, said Brad Udall, senior water and climate research scholar at Colorado State University’s Colorado Water Institute.

Half of Denver’s water comes from the Colorado River system. In Las Vegas, 90% of the water comes from the river.

“All of these places are really dependent on it,” Udall said. “And you can’t fallow cities.”

‘We need to be working as quickly as possible’

The Denver Post requested an interview with all seven of the state negotiators. Three states — New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona — declined an interview and two others — Wyoming and Utah — did not respond.

Colorado’s negotiator, Colorado River Commissioner Becky Mitchell, said in a statement that she is focused on working with the other basin states to find a consensus approach for post-2026 operations.

“I hope the basin states are able to work towards sustainable, supply-driven operations of lakes Powell and Mead that are resilient across a range of hydrologic conditions experienced in the basin,” she said. “This past winter’s snowpack is a stark reminder of why a supply-driven approach, one that requires all of us to live within the means of the river, is of absolute necessity if we are to enjoy a sustainable future across the entire Colorado River Basin.”

The states’ negotiators will not speak together at an upcoming major Colorado River conference — a departure from years prior, where representatives from each state appeared on a panel to discuss interstate relations.

The lack of a seven-state panel at the Getches-Wilkinson Conference at the University of Colorado Boulder next week echoes a change at the last major Colorado River conference — the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in December — where each basin held its own panel, but the negotiators did not appear together or even meet while all in Las Vegas for that conference.

Hamby said the lack of a panel in Boulder does not signify anything substantial and that negotiators are prioritizing meeting to negotiate over talking on a stage.

The primary question negotiators must settle is how to share the pain of shrinking water supplies between the Upper Basin — which includes Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming and Utah — and the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada.

The Upper Basin states sit upstream of Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Without large reservoirs in which to store water, the Upper Basin states’ water supply is reliant on snowpack and precipitation, which can vary widely year to year. In contrast, the Lower Basin’s water supply is more consistent and predictable as it comes from Lake Mead and Lake Powell.

Upper Basin negotiators have said their states should not have to take mandatory cuts to their water supplies because they have never used their entire legal allotment and already absorb water shortages nearly every year due to shrinking flows. Lower Basin negotiators have said everyone in the basin should be forced to use less water in the driest years.

Negotiators are feeling pressure to quickly bridge those differing views and settle a number of other related questions.

“There’s a general feeling that we need to be working as quickly as possible this year,” Hamby said.

Officials at the Bureau of Reclamation in January made public a document outlining five possible plans for managing the river and its two reservoirs.

The agency is now working to complete a draft analysis of how each of those plans would function and impact the environment, which bureau officials previously said would be published in the summer of 2025.

After the draft is published, the bureau will solicit public comment, issue a final environmental assessment and then decide which plan to implement. Bureau officials previously said they must make a final decision by August 2026. If the states can create their own consensus plan, it will be included in this process.

Bureau officials this week did not answer a question about whether they had given the states a deadline for presenting a consensus plan so that it can be included in the lengthy analysis process, which is legally required under the National Environmental Policy Act. They also did not answer a question about when they planned to publish the draft environmental analysis.

Instead, spokesman Peter Soeth sent a statement stating the bureau and the Department of the Interior “are dedicated to providing life-sustaining water and harnessing the significant hydropower the river offers.”

“We are actively engaging in dialogue with the Colorado River Basin partners as we work towards long-term operational agreements for the river after 2026,” the statement said. “Throughout this effort, we remain committed to ensuring fiscal responsibility for the American people.”

It is critical for the states to reach an agreement soon so that there is remaining time for the public to provide input on the proposed plan and to avoid the courts deciding the future of the river basin, Pitt said.

“Regardless of which justices would be called upon to hear this case, it seems inherently clear to me that water managers with decades of experience managing Western water supplies will do a better job creating a management plan for the Colorado River than judges deciding a series of incredibly narrow legal questions,” she said. “That is the worst possible option.”

Both Pitt and Jennifer Gimbel, senior water policy scholar at Colorado State University, expressed optimism that the states would find a solution — or a way to buy a little more time.

“They do have a time crunch, but there’s always ways to bridge that time if they need to,” Gimbel said.

Here’s what we know","(CNN) — Editor’s note: Find the latest coverage of the Boulder attack here.

A man yelled “free Palestine” as he used incendiary devices – including a “makeshift flamethrower” – to set people on fire during a Jewish community event in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday, in what authorities are calling another “targeted” antisemitic attack.

Witnesses described seeing huge flames and people pouring buckets of water onto burning victims. At least eight were injured, including four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, authorities said. Two victims were airlifted to the Denver metro area. At least one victim was “very seriously injured,” officials said.

The FBI is investigating the attack as “an act of terrorism,” the agency said. It happened at a weekly walk held in Boulder in support of the Israeli hostages who remain held by Hamas in Gaza. Among the eight injured is a Holocaust survivor, according to an individual who knows the person and who was at the event. It is unclear what their condition is.

The suspect has been identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, according to the FBI. In videos obtained by CNN, the suspect is seen shirtless, yelling “Palestine is free!” “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” The suspect is carrying two bottles, and witnesses can be heard saying he’s “spraying alcohol” and “he’s making Molotov cocktails.”

Soliman was booked into the Boulder County jail just before midnight Sunday on multiple felony charges, including one count of explosives or incendiary devices used during a felony, according to online jail records.

The records also show Soliman was booked on two counts of murder in the 1st degree, but the circumstances around those charges are unclear, as authorities have not announced any deaths resulting from the attack.

CNN reached out to the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office for comment. Soliman has a court date scheduled for Monday at 1:30 p.m. local time, according to the online jail records, which show he is being held on a bond of $10 million.

Officials are working to assess whether the alleged attacker has any possible mental health issues, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. The FBI was also conducting “court-authorized law enforcement activity” in El Paso County, a little over 100 miles from Boulder, where the suspect is believed to live.

Sunday’s attack comes less than two weeks after two young Israeli Embassy staffers were fatally shot in Washington, DC, by a man who claimed to have been acting “for Gaza.”

“The Jewish community has been warning the world that chants of ‘globalize the Intifada’ and ‘resistance by any means necessary’ are calls to violence. We’ve now seen that violence erupt in America twice in less than two weeks,” Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.

Here’s what else we know about the Boulder attack.

Sunday’s attack took place on the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, where a weekly ‘Run for Their Lives’ event was being held. The event, which has taken place consistently since mid-October 2023, aims to raise awareness for Israeli hostages being held captive by Hamas.

“This global grass roots organization was founded on October 15, 2023, a week after the horrendous terrorist attack by Hamas … These walks have been held every week since then for all the hostages – without any violent incidents until today,” the organization said in a statement.

Brian H, an eyewitness who did not want to give his full name, told CNN he and his family were dining at a food hall near the scene of the crime, when a woman ran towards them saying that a man was “throwing fire” at people.

Brian got up and ran into the courtyard, where he saw a man carrying a tank on his back that resembled a gardening chemical sprayer. Videos obtained by CNN show witnesses to the attack saying Soliman was “making Molotov cocktails.”

“I saw fabric coming out of it, and I quickly realized that it was a Molotov cocktail. One had already exploded right in front of us,” Brian said.

He noted that another man was trying to talk the suspect down, but the suspect kept yelling, “f**k you, Zionist,” “you all deserve to die,” and “you’ve killed these children.”

“He was very erratic, shouting and spewing terrible things at different people,” Brian said.

After calling 911, Brian approached to see if he could assist any victims. He described seeing an elderly woman lying on the ground, unresponsive.

“There were several people attending to her and wrapping her up, trying to ensure she was OK,” he said. People from a restaurant across the street were bringing large buckets of ice water to help extinguish the flames, he added.

He grabbed a bucket and filled it with water from a fountain in the middle of the courtyard, he said.

“I just kept filling that up and pouring it on their legs,” Brian explained. “Their pants were completely burned and singed off. It looked like their skin had just melted off their bodies.”

The suspect pinned to the ground and arrested near the scene of the attack was identified as Soliman, FBI Denver Special Agent-in-Charge Mark D. Michalek said Sunday night.

Videos obtained by CNN capture Soliman, shirtless, faced down on a patch of grass near an area with obvious burn marks. Around him, black clouds of smoke billowed in the air.

“After committing the attack, the suspect told police “I did it to avenge my people,” one of the law enforcement officials said.”

While senior FBI officials have deemed the incident an act of terrorism, authorities are working to determine whether Soliman may have been suffering from mental illness, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.

Soliman arrived in the United States in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor, according to multiple law enforcement officials.

He filed a claim a month later, in September, and was granted a work authorization in March 2023. The authorization expired at the end of March of this year, at which point it appears he remained here illegally, the officials added.

Law enforcement sources previously told CNN the suspect had applied for asylum and been rejected for a visa in 2005. It’s unclear how and when the suspect entered the US.

‘Makeshift flamethrower’ likely did not require complex materials, source says

FBI agents and federal prosecutors are still reviewing the circumstances of the incident to determine whether Soliman will be charged with terrorism or under other possible federal criminal statutes, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.

The FBI has recently investigated foreign-inspired extremists who might use high-powered weapons, explosives, or vehicles to cause mass casualty incidents in the US, but Soliman’s use of Molotov cocktails, which can be constructed from materials easily obtained, do not appear to fit the profile of a terrorist intent on causing large-scale causalities, the source said.

The “makeshift flamethrower” likely did not require him to buy complex materials that would have put him on law enforcement’s radar, former FBI agent Bobby Chacon told CNN.

“You can probably get some kind of crude device like that without raising any flags. Simple torches or something. All you need is something – a propellant – to propel it out,” Chacon said.

Molotov cocktails and similar improvised incendiary devices are unfortunately “easily assembled” but can result in some of the most severe injuries, said Chacon.

“Burns are one of the most horrific injuries you can perpetuate onto someone,” Chacon told CNN. “These are hard, very painful injuries to go through and to survive.”

FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post that “we are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.”

The attack in Boulder is “being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said on social media Sunday.

“Our leadership team on the ground in Boulder will be updating you shortly on the attack in Boulder,” Bongino wrote in a post on X.

Jewish leaders on high alert after second antisemitic attack in two weeks

“Today, six people were set on fire by a terrorist in Boulder, Colorado. Why? Because they were calling for 58 hostages still held by Hamas terrorists to finally be returned home,” Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.

The Boulder attack was part of a “wave of domestic terror attacks aimed at the Jewish community,” said Eric D. Fingerhut, the president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. Fingerhut outlined a six-point plan for the federal government to address the growing threat.

His proposals included increasing a nonprofit security grant program funding to $1 billion to meet urgent needs, dedicating resources for security personnel at Jewish institutions, bolstering FBI intelligence capabilities to thwart domestic terrorism and holding social media platforms accountable for spreading antisemitic hate and incitement, among others.

In response to Sunday’s attack, authorities in major cities across the US have deployed extra security at Jewish sites and community centers.

On Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced in a statement an emergency meeting will be held in City Hall to address heightened security ahead of the Jewish holiday Shavuot. Mayor Bass also said the Los Angeles Police Department would be conducting “extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers” throughout the city.

“Antisemitism will not be tolerated,” she said.

On the East Coast, the New York Police Department said its presence has increased at synagogues and other religious ﻿sites across the city for Shavuot.

FBI Director Kash Patel described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack"", and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be ""a hate crime given the group that was targeted"".

But Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier in the day that information on the attack, which occurred near a demonstration to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza, was ""very preliminary"".

""This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act was unacceptable,"" he said. ""I ask that you join me in thinking about the victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.""

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the US over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel led by President Donald Trump to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. His administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite US universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

""Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water',"" Coffman said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said he was closely monitoring the situation.

""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.""

The attack follows last month's arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, DC. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fuelled polarisation in the US over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis posted on social media that it was ""unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder"".

“I just kept filling that up and pouring it on their legs,” Brian explained. “Their pants were completely burned and singed off. It looked like their skin had just melted off their bodies.”

The suspect pinned to the ground and arrested near the scene of the attack was identified as Soliman, FBI Denver Special Agent-in-Charge Mark D. Michalek said Sunday night.

Videos obtained by CNN capture Soliman, shirtless, faced down on a patch of grass near an area with obvious burn marks. Around him, black clouds of smoke billowed in the air.

“After committing the attack, the suspect told police “I did it to avenge my people,” one of the law enforcement officials said.”

While senior FBI officials have deemed the incident an act of terrorism, authorities are working to determine whether Soliman may have been suffering from mental illness, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.

Soliman arrived in the United States in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor, according to multiple law enforcement officials.

He filed a claim a month later, in September, and was granted a work authorization in March 2023. The authorization expired at the end of March of this year, at which point it appears he remained here illegally, the officials added.

Law enforcement sources previously told CNN the suspect had applied for asylum and been rejected for a visa in 2005. It’s unclear how and when the suspect entered the US.

‘Makeshift flamethrower’ likely did not require complex materials, source says

FBI agents and federal prosecutors are still reviewing the circumstances of the incident to determine whether Soliman will be charged with terrorism or under other possible federal criminal statutes, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.

The FBI has recently investigated foreign-inspired extremists who might use high-powered weapons, explosives, or vehicles to cause mass casualty incidents in the US, but Soliman’s use of Molotov cocktails, which can be constructed from materials easily obtained, do not appear to fit the profile of a terrorist intent on causing large-scale causalities, the source said.

The “makeshift flamethrower” likely did not require him to buy complex materials that would have put him on law enforcement’s radar, former FBI agent Bobby Chacon told CNN.

“You can probably get some kind of crude device like that without raising any flags. Simple torches or something. All you need is something – a propellant – to propel it out,” Chacon said.

Molotov cocktails and similar improvised incendiary devices are unfortunately “easily assembled” but can result in some of the most severe injuries, said Chacon.

“Burns are one of the most horrific injuries you can perpetuate onto someone,” Chacon told CNN. “These are hard, very painful injuries to go through and to survive.”

FBI Director Kash Patel said in a social media post that “we are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.”

The attack in Boulder is “being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said on social media Sunday.

“Our leadership team on the ground in Boulder will be updating you shortly on the attack in Boulder,” Bongino wrote in a post on X.

Jewish leaders on high alert after second antisemitic attack in two weeks

“Today, six people were set on fire by a terrorist in Boulder, Colorado. Why? Because they were calling for 58 hostages still held by Hamas terrorists to finally be returned home,” Ted Deutch, CEO of the American Jewish Committee, said on social media.

The Boulder attack was part of a “wave of domestic terror attacks aimed at the Jewish community,” said Eric D. Fingerhut, the president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. Fingerhut outlined a six-point plan for the federal government to address the growing threat.

His proposals included increasing a nonprofit security grant program funding to $1 billion to meet urgent needs, dedicating resources for security personnel at Jewish institutions, bolstering FBI intelligence capabilities to thwart domestic terrorism and holding social media platforms accountable for spreading antisemitic hate and incitement, among others.

In response to Sunday’s attack, authorities in major cities across the US have deployed extra security at Jewish sites and community centers.

On Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced in a statement an emergency meeting will be held in City Hall to address heightened security ahead of the Jewish holiday Shavuot. Mayor Bass also said the Los Angeles Police Department would be conducting “extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers” throughout the city.

“Antisemitism will not be tolerated,” she said.

On the East Coast, the New York Police Department said its presence has increased at synagogues and other religious ﻿sites across the city for Shavuot.

FBI Assistant Director for Public Affairs Ben Williamson said on X, a social media site, that the suspect ""shouted 'Free Palestine' while throwing fire bombs at a crowd of Jewish people"".

FBI Director Kash Patel described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack"", and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be ""a hate crime given the group that was targeted"".

But Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said earlier in the day that information on the attack, which occurred near a demonstration to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza, was ""very preliminary"".

""This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act was unacceptable,"" he said. ""I ask that you join me in thinking about the victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.""

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the US over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel led by President Donald Trump to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. His administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite US universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

""Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water',"" Coffman said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said he was closely monitoring the situation.

""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.""

The attack follows last month's arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, DC. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fuelled polarisation in the US over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis posted on social media that it was ""unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder"".

Redfearn said he was not able to identify the suspect yet, noting that he had been taken to hospital.

The FBI has named the suspect in a horrifying attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon, where he allegedly used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and threw ""an incendiary device"" into a crowd

The FBI has identified Mohamed Sabry Soliman as the culprit behind a harrowing attack in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday afternoon.

In the violent spree, six people between the ages of 67 and 88 were rushed to hospital after Soliman deployed a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and hurled ""an incendiary device"" into a crowd, according to FBI statements. The lead FBI agent revealed that during the attack, the suspect was heard shouting ""Free Palestine"".

The assault targeted participants of Run for Their Lives, a Jewish American group that organises regular public walks to call for the immediate release of captives held by Hamas.

The chaos led to multiple injuries, with authorities indicating that the severity ranged from minor to more serious. Soliman also suffered injuries in the incident.

A substantial law enforcement presence is still on the scene, with ongoing collaboration between local, state, and federal agencies.

Initial witness statements offered a stark account, with one describing seeing ""a man with a weapon [was] lighting people on fire.""

FBI Director Kash Patel has slammed the vile act as a ""targeted terror attack"" in a statement on X. In contrast, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn took a cautious stance at an initial press briefing, saying: ""It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on.""

At a press conference, District Attorney Michael Dougherty said: ""In the coming days decisions will be made about what charges to file and where, there's a couple of different options. But what I would stress now is that we are fully united 100% in making sure the charges we bring hold the attacker fully accountable.""

The suspect was caught on camera sprawled out on the grass, pinned down by police.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser issued a statement saying: ""My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today's attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.""

The Attorney General continued: ""From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General's Office.

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts-which are becoming more frequent, brazen and closer to home-must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.""

Here's all you need to know about the Colorado attack: 1. Colorado authorities were quoted by Reuters as saying there were six victims in the attack. They were taken to local hospitals. The wounded victims ranged in age from 67 to 88 years, police said.

2. According to reports, the incident took place at the intersection of 13th Street and Pearl Street on Sunday afternoon (local time) — near a demonstration to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

It happened near a popular pedestrian mall in Boulder where demonstrators with a volunteer group called 'Run For Their Lives' had gathered to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza as the war between Israel and Hamas continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States.

3. Witnesses said the suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims during a march in support of Israeli hostages, according to an FBI official, as per CBS News.

Police said the male suspect was taken into custody on Sunday after the attack left multiple people with burns in Boulder, Colorado. Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the man was apprehended following calls to police dispatch of someone with a weapon who was “setting people on fire.”

5. In one video, apparently of the attack, a shirtless man holding clear spray bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns. He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"", ""Palestine is Free!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red t-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

6. FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism. “This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

7. FBI Director Kash Patel immediately labelled it a “targeted terrorist attack.” Meanwhile, the US Justice Department, which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations, — decried the attack as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.”

9. Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the pedestrian mall.

According to ABC News, authorities evacuated the area from Broadway to the west, Pine Street to the north and 16th Street to the east, and Walnut Street to the south and have been conducting a probe into the incident.",Molotov cocktail attack: Colorado authorities reportedly said there were six victims in the attack.

Police said eight people - aged between 52 and 88 - were hurt in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver.

The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect had used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices.

Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group, holding what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Police received calls around 13:26 local time (19:26 GMT) on Sunday about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn told a news conference.

One of those hurt in the attack was a Holocaust survivor, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a ""very loving person"" to the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks that appears to be related to the conflict in Gaza.

A man who shouted ""free Palestine"" fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.
• None What we know about the attack so far

After Sunday's incident, witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd"", Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI's Denver office, said.

He identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

Mr Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials told CBS. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources told the broadcaster, and had been living in Colorado Springs.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr Soliman had been given a work permit after his visa expired under the previous Biden administration. The BBC has not verified this.

Warning: This story contains details some readers may find distressing.

Footage that appeared to be from the attack shows a chaotic scene: smoke filling the air, people running in multiple directions, spots of grass on fire and people injured on the ground.

In images and videos posted online, a man who appears to be the suspect is seen without a shirt and holding bottles with liquid with pieces of red cloth inside them. He can be heard yelling at the crowd and appears to be advancing towards them as some rush to flee.

As he screams, one woman is seen on the ground and appears injured. People surround her and a man pours water on her body.

Footage shows police rushing to the scene and arresting the suspect. Police say he was taken to hospital with injuries.

""It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Mr Michalek said. ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country.""

Colorado's Attorney General Phil Weiser said that from what officials knew, the attack ""appears to be hate crime given the group that was targeted"".

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said in a statement on Sunday. ""Hate has no place in Colorado.""

Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, said he was ""shocked"" by the incident and called the attack ""pure antisemitism fuelled by the blood libels spread in the media"".

Police said eight people - aged between 52 and 88 - were hurt in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver.

The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect had used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices.

Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group, holding what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Police received calls around 13:26 local time (19:26 GMT) on Sunday about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn told a news conference.

One of those hurt in the attack was a Holocaust survivor, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a ""very loving person"" to the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks that appears to be related to the conflict in Gaza.

A man who shouted ""free Palestine"" fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.

After Sunday's incident, witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd"", Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI's Denver office, said.

He identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

Mr Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials told CBS. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources told the broadcaster, and had been living in Colorado Springs.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr Soliman had been given a work permit after his visa expired under the previous Biden administration. The BBC has not verified this.

Footage that appeared to be from the attack shows a chaotic scene: smoke filling the air, people running in multiple directions, spots of grass on fire and people injured on the ground.

In images and videos posted online, a man who appears to be the suspect is seen without a shirt and holding bottles with liquid with pieces of red cloth inside them. He can be heard yelling at the crowd and appears to be advancing towards them as some rush to flee.

As he screams, one woman is seen on the ground and appears injured. People surround her and a man pours water on her body.

Footage shows police rushing to the scene and arresting the suspect. Police say he was taken to hospital with injuries.

Run for Their Lives, an American Jewish organisation that hosts public walks to demand the prompt release of Hamas captives, was the focus of the assault. The group's website portrays their events as peaceful demonstrations standing in unity with the hostages and their families.

The attack led to several injuries, with the extent of harm suffered by victims varying from minor to severe, according to the authorities. The aggressor, identified as Soliman, sustained injuries himself.

District Attorney Michael Dougherty, addressing the media, vowed: ""In the coming days decisions will be made about what charges to file and where, there's a couple of different options.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested and taken to the hospital with minor injuries after his alleged attack on the ""Run for Their Lives"" group that was gathering on Pearl Street, police said Sunday night.

The group is a grassroots organization that facilitates global run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. This particular chapter of the group meets on a weekly basis, police said.

Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa after entering the U.S. during the Biden administration, three Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sources told Fox News.

Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa.

He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left. On Sept. 9, 2022, he filed a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

On March 29, 2023, Soliman was granted work authorization, which was valid through March of this year.

Soliman was allegedly yelling ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, which was near the county courthouse on Pearl Street. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with weapon setting people on fire.

The FBI said eight people, ages 52 to 88, were injured and taken to the hospital. One of those victims is considered to be in critical condition.

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of ""ideologically motivated violence,"" based on early information, evidence and witness accounts.

Terror suspect accused of firebombing pro-Israel rally,"A peaceful demonstration on Sunday raising awareness for Israeli hostages took a harrowing turn after a man allegedly used Molotov cocktails to set marchers ablaze.

Police in Boulder, Colorado have arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, in connection with the attack. The FBI called the attack a ""targeted act of violence” and is investigating it as an act of terrorism.

The man allegedly shouted “Free Palestine!” as he used a “makeshift flame thrower” and threw an “incendiary device” into the crowd, the FBI said. Some 16 unused Molotov cocktails were found at the scene.

Fifteen people and a dog were injured in the attack, with one in critical condition. The victims have not been publicly identified.

Here’s everything we know about the attack.

He has now been charged with a federal hate crime, one count of attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, one count of causing serious injury to an at-risk adult or someone over 70, and one count of using explosives or incendiary devices. Early reports suggested he was also charged with two counts of first-degree murder, though there have been no deaths reported.

The FBI said the attack is also being investigated as an act of terrorism. Soliman reportedly told police that he had specifically targeted what he referred to as a “Zionist group” and had been planning the attack for a year. He also said he would do it again.

Soliman is a native of Egypt. He entered the country in August 2022 on a visa issued during the administration of former President Joe Biden, on a non-immigrant visa that allowed him to stay until February 2023, Department of Homeland Security sources told Fox News.

Those sources told Fox that Soliman was granted work authorization in March 2023, which allowed him to stay until March 2025.

According to CBS News, Soliman began working as an Uber food delivery driver in the spring of 2023 and began driving passengers about nine months ago. A company spokesperson said his employment has now been terminated.

He appeared in court for the first time on Monday afternoon charged with a federal hate crime and 16 counts of attempted murder.

Just after 2 p.m. on Sunday, Boulder Police announced they were responding to a report that a man with a weapon was setting people on fire.

At the time of the attack, Run for Their Lives, a group of demonstrators raising awareness for the Israeli hostages that remain in Gaza, were marching on Pearl Street, as they do every Sunday, organizations have said.

Soliman allegedly used a “makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device” into the crowd as he yelled “Free Palestine!”, the FBI said.

Ed Victor, one of about 30 people marching, told CBS News that the group was peacefully walking down Pearl Street when the attack occurred.

""... all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown,” Victor told the outlet.

Another marcher “saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,” he said.

Two sources told CBS News that witnesses told investigators the suspect also yelled “End Zionist!” in the attack.

How many victims were injured?

Authorities have confirmed the identities of 15 people, aged between 25 and 88 who were injured in the attack. Earlier, authorities said there were six injured people. A dog was also hurt in the incident, police said on Wednesday.

The oldest victim is a Holocaust survivor and a “very loving person”, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS News.

Some were suffering from wounds that were consistent with burns, Redfearn said. Their injuries range from minor to critical, according to the FBI.

UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora told 9News they had received two patients in connection with the attack.

A witness told FOX31 that each victim they saw “ had skin basically melted or hanging ... from their legs.”

What comes next in the investigation?

Local, state, and federal law enforcement are investigating the planning behind Sunday’s attack, as well as Soliman’s alleged motives.

Soliman was reportedly cooperative after being arrested on Sunday, and alerted the FBI to an iPhone hidden in his Colorado Springs home with messages to his family, as well as a journal, per court documents.

The Egyptian national allegedly told investigators about what motivated the attack, with Soliman saying he “hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over ‘our land,’ which he explained to be Palestine,” according to court documents.

Officials said that the 45-year-old attempted to purchase a gun prior to the fire attack, only to be denied because he is not a U.S. citizen.

The plot against the activists was not on police’s radar ahead of Sunday, but the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office said Monday it had received three non-criminal calls to Soliman’s home since December 2022, including one involving “juvenile contact.” The Egyptian had also previously been involved in four traffic stops.

Soliman is due next in court at 3:30pm MT on Thursday, where he will face the official filing of state charges.

He is currently in jail in Boulder County on $10 million bond.

What has been said about the Boulder terror attack?

Temple Emmanuel Senior Rabbi Joseph Black said the Jewish community was shocked.

“I think we're feeling a multitude of emotions – fear, anger, despair,” he told Denver7, adding that that Temle Emmanuel has taken “very intense security protocols” to keep the congregation safe.

“This will not stop us, in any way, shape or form,” he said.

Nonprofit organizations and federal officials have condemned the attack.

“My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation,” Jared Polis, Colorado’s Democratic governor, wrote in a statement.

Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Negus, who represents Boulder, said he’s “praying hard” for the victims. “We are closely monitoring, and are in contact with local law enforcement regarding the horrific attack on Pearl Street Mall. Praying hard for the victims,” he wrote on X.

President Trump blamed Biden administration “open border” policies for the attack, though Soliman entered the U.S. legally on a travel visa.

“[Soliman] came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “He must go out under ‘TRUMP’ Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.”

The Boulder Jewish Community issued a joint statement in the wake of the incident. ""We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed,” the statement read.

The statement continued: “When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another. Strength to you all.”

The Anti-Defamation League said it was aware of the reports of the attack at Boulder Run for Their Lives event, which the nonprofit described as “a weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages kidnapped on 10/7.”

Jim Berk, the CEO of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization, denounced Sunday’s attack and mentioned the recent killing of the couple working at Israel’s embassy in Washington D.C.

“This marks the second violent assault on Jewish and pro-Israel civilians in the U.S. in less than two weeks—a chilling escalation that cannot be dismissed as coincidence. On May 21, two Israeli Embassy staffers were gunned down in cold blood in Washington, D.C., and now the extremist violence has come to Boulder, CO,” said Simon Wiesenthal Center CEO Jim Berk.

“Both attacks are the direct result of months of anti-Israel propaganda, moral equivocation, and silence in the face of raging antisemitism. The nonstop demonization of Israel and Zionism on our campuses, in our streets, and across digital platforms has created a climate where hate flourishes, and physical attacks—even murder—of Jews is inevitable.”","Victims suffered from injuries consistent with burns in shocking incident, police say"

According to Boulder Police Department (BPD) Chief Steve Redfearn, officers were called to the county courthouse on Pearl Street at about 1:26 pm (local time) for reports of a man who had a weapon, setting people on fire, Fox News reported.

According to the BPD and the FBI, Soliman, who was shouting “Free Palestine” during the attack, was arrested at the spot.

Local media cited eyewitnesses describing a man throwing something resembling a homemade Molotov cocktail at the group.

In one video, apparently of the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said the attack is being probed as an act of “ideologically motivated violence,” on the basis of early information, evidence and witness accounts.

The incident occurred near an event organised by “Run for Their Lives,” a grassroots organisation that facilitates global run and walk events demanding the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).

The ADL Center on Extremism reviewed videos from the spot and said the suspect appeared to say, “How many children you killed,” “We have to end Zionists, and “They are killers.” It is not clear how many people were injured. However, police has confirmed some were life-threatening.

Still, beyond that, the four announced candidates in the growing primary field bring different backgrounds and approaches to the table.

For Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney and a former head of the criminal division at the Attorney General’s Office, that includes his 27 years as a courtroom attorney and prosecutor, along with experience overseeing hundreds of lawyers in the offices he’s managed — a key distinction, he noted this week in an online discussion, since Colorado’s Department of Law’s more than 500 employees make it the equivalent of one of the largest law firms in the state.

Dougherty’s Democratic primary rivals are Secretary of State Jena Griswold, former state House Speaker Crisanta Duran and David Seligman, a nationally prominent public interest attorney who runs a Denver-based nonprofit firm. Political newcomer Connor Pennington is so far the only Republican in the race, though both primary line-ups are expected to grow in the coming months.

Another Democrat, former Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General Hetal J. Doshi, appears to be nearing an announcement, while Republicans who have expressed interest in the race include Assistant House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, R-Colorado Springs, and El Paso County District Attorney Michael Allen.

Dougherty was joined on May 29 by three of his fellow elected prosecutors — two Democrats and one Republican — on a 45-minute teleconference with reporters set up by his campaign, with the district attorneys all stressing that Dougherty “gets it,” when it comes to what it takes to be an effective attorney general.

Without mentioning any of his primary rivals by name, Dougherty and his backers drew obvious contrasts with the rest of the field.

All four acknowledged that responding to the Trump administration in court will almost certainly be a big part of the next attorney general’s job, if a Democrat wins the position — Weiser has led or joined more than a dozen lawsuits this year challenging the administration — but also insisted that bringing a overly partisan agenda to the office threatens faith in the rule of law.

“We have some real challenges here in Colorado coming at us from the Trump administration, and I can promise you that as the next attorney general, I’m always going to make decisions about what’s right based on the rule of law and principle, never political agendas and never a political ambition,” Dougherty said. “And I think where we lose the trust of the people we serve, where we undermine the confidence and integrity that people place in our justice system, is when they sense that the leader of an office — whether it be a district attorney’s office or the Attorney General’s Office — is hyper-partisan and being guided by something other than the rule of law and principle.”

Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubenstein, a Republican, drew national attention last year when he led the successful prosecution—with an assist from Weiser—of former county clerk Tina Peters for the Republican’s role in a scheme to breach the county’s secure election equipment. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump called Peters a “political prisoner” and demanded that state officials release her from prison, where she’s serving a nine-year sentence.

Endorsing Dougherty, Rubenstein said “the party line” shouldn’t be an issue in the attorney general’s race.

“We should be focusing on what is the right thing for Colorado, who has the experience in litigation, who has the experience in running a large law office that can make good decisions, and that the decisions are not going to be made because you’re trying to score political points,” Rubenstein said. “They’re not going to be made because you’re trying to turn something into a way to get yourself on TV, to show that you’re doing something, but actually focusing on what is going to make Colorado a better, healthier, safer place. And I know Michael to be that guy.”

Fifth Judicial District Attorney Heidi McCollum, a Democrat and the elected prosecutor for Eagle, Lake, Summit and Clear Creek counties, said Rubenstein demonstrated the right approach in the Peters case.

“The application of the law is not supposed to be based on someone’s gender or someone’s color of their skin or someone’s political party, and unfortunately, that’s where we are at right now,” she said. Calling the potential overturning of Peters’ conviction “an injustice to us all,” McCollum added: “DA Rubinstein prosecuted that case not because of any particular political party. Quite frankly, he showed a great deal of integrity in doing what he did, because it was the right thing to do, and that’s the kind of leader we need in in the attorney general’s office.”

Brian Mason, the 17th Judicial District attorney, who prosecutes cases in Adams County and Broomfield and considered running for attorney general before endorsing Dougherty, said it’s a given that the Democrats running for the office will endeavor to take on Trump.

“I know each of these candidates, and every single one of them is going to say that they’re a fighter, and I believe each one of them is,” Mason said. “The question is, who is best equipped to actually take that fight and to lead that fight? It’s one thing to say, ‘I’m going to fight against the Trump administration.’ It’s another to have the legal prowess and legal acumen to actually know how to file the case, lead the case, oversee the case, and win the case. Those are two very separate things.”

Mason said that Dougherty, who helped run the 1,300-employee Manhattan District Attorney’s Office before joining the Colorado attorney general’s office two decades ago, has “the experience and the management chops” to do it.

“This is an office that is going to be undertaking a lot of litigation in a variety of ways, and it’s important that the leader of that organization, the leader of that law office, be somebody who has a history in litigation, who understands it, who understands the limited resources that the law office has and is always looking out for what is best for Colorado,” Mason said, adding, “There’s a lot of noise out there, and a lot of things that can get distracting, and a lot of rabbit holes that people can go down for political reasons that really doesn’t serve the interest of Colorado and the interest of evenly applying the rules of law to the entire state.”","The Democrats running in next year's election to succeed term-limited Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser agree that the state's next top lawyer needs to be a fighter.

Fox News’s Bill Melugin revealed that “three senior” DHS sources said Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is “an Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally,” and has overstayed his visa after entering the United States under the Biden administration.

Melugin added that he was “told” Soliman “arrived at LAX on 8/27/22 on a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through 2/26/23, but he overstayed & never left.”

“I’m told on 9/29/22, he filed some sort of claim with USCIS, potentially an asylum claim, and on 3/29/23, USCIS under the Biden admin gave him work authorization, which expired on 3/28/25,” Melugin added.

Melugin’s post came after FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek revealed during a press conference that Soliman had been identified as the suspect behind the attack which left multiple people injured and burned. Michalek also said there were six victims between the ages of 67-88 and that witnesses had reported the suspect had “used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd.”

“I’m able to confirm there are six victims, ages 67-88, all of them have been transported to local hospitals,” Michalek shared. “This attack happened at a regularly scheduled weekly peaceful event. Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd. The suspect was heard to yell, ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack. The subject has been identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, and he’s 45-years-old.”

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek continued. “Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country, this is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation.”

The identification of Soliman as the suspect behind the attack in Boulder comes hours after reports came out that multiple people had been injured and burned by an attacker with Molotov cocktails while they were taking part in a pro-Israel walk to support hostages held by Hamas.

Videos on social media show Soliman allegedly shouting, “end Zionists,” and, “Palestine is Free.”

One person, Rick Holter told Colorado Public Radio (CPR) News that after he left a store, he saw “someone on the ground being doused by bystanders” and a “shirtless man holding squirt bottles and yelling”:

CPR News spoke with Rick Holter of Pagosa Springs, who was in a store nearby when someone said there was fire outside. When he exited, Holter didn’t see anything aflame, although there was someone on the ground being doused by bystanders. He also saw a shirtless man holding squirt bottles and yelling. “We watched as the police arrived a couple of minutes later and this guy, the shirtless guy, went down on the ground and was handcuffed and taken away then,” said Holter.

Another witness told KDVR News there was a woman “burning on the ground,” and two other people had been “impacted by burns on their legs”:

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) issued a statement that his thoughts were with the “people who have been injured by this heinous” attack on the Jewish community. Polis added that the suspect should be “prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community. I’ve spoken with Boulder Mayor Brockett, and my administration is working closely with local and federal law enforcement on this afternoon’s attack.”

“As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,” Polis continued. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days.

Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group, holding what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza. Police received calls around 13:26 local time (19:26 GMT) on Sunday about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn told a news conference. One of those hurt in the attack was a Holocaust survivor, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder. Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a ""very loving person"" to the BBC's US partner CBS News. The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks that appears to be related to the conflict in Gaza. A man who shouted ""free Palestine"" fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.

After Sunday's incident, witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd"", Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI's Denver office, said. He identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who was taken to hospital after being arrested and later booked into the county jail on a number of charges. He is due to appear in court later on Monday. Mr Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials told CBS. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources told the broadcaster, and had been living in Colorado Springs. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr Soliman had been given a work permit after his visa expired under the previous Biden administration. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security, said the suspect entered the country on a tourist visa and filed for asylum in September 2022.

Watch: FBI investigating Colorado attack as an 'act of terrorism'

Footage that appeared to be from the attack shows a chaotic scene: smoke filling the air, people running in multiple directions, spots of grass on fire and people injured on the ground. In images and videos posted online, a man who appears to be the suspect is seen without a shirt and holding bottles with liquid with pieces of red cloth inside them. He can be heard yelling at the crowd and appears to be advancing towards them as some rush to flee. As he screams, one woman is seen on the ground and appears injured. People surround her and a man pours water on her body. Footage shows police rushing to the scene and arresting the suspect. Police say he was taken to hospital with injuries. ""It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Mr Michalek said. ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country."" Colorado's Attorney General Phil Weiser said that from what officials knew, the attack ""appears to be hate crime given the group that was targeted"". ""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said in a statement on Sunday. ""Hate has no place in Colorado."" Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, said he was ""shocked"" by the incident and called the attack ""pure antisemitism fuelled by the blood libels spread in the media"". Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called for ""concrete action"" in response to the attack. ""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said.",The FBI calls it a suspected terror attack and says the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a news conference that Boulder dispatch received several calls reporting an incident at the county courthouse in downtown Boulder at approximately 1:26 p.m. local time (1926 GMT), Xinhua news agency reported.

Police officers found several victims suffering from burns and other injuries upon arriving at the scene.

An organiser with Run For Their Lives -- a group that holds weekly walks to raise awareness about Israeli hostages held in Gaza -- told local television station KUSA that five people were burned in the attack.

When they arrived at the historic courthouse near 13th and Pearl Streets, a man was waiting with bottles, the organizer was quoted as saying in the report.

The suspect threw the bottles, burning five people, including a woman who was severely injured and had to roll on the ground to extinguish the flames, according to the report.

In a social media post, FBI Director Kash Patel said, ""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado.""

""Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,"" he added.

Redfearn condemned the incident as ""unacceptable,"" but noted it was still too early for police to speculate on a motive.

""I am closely monitoring the situation in Boulder, and my thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror,"" Colorado Governor Jared Polis said in a post on X, adding, ""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.""

The attacker, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was taken into custody following the assault, which left several individuals injured.

The protest, organised by the group Run For Their Lives, was held near the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall and was intended to raise awareness about the hostages still being held in Gaza amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.

In a post on X, Ambassador Danon wrote, ""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America. Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages.""

""In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing Molotov cocktails at them. Make no mistake â€"" this is not a political protest, this is terrorism.

According to eyewitnesses and video footage circulating online, Soliman was seen shouting ""Free Palestine"" and ""End Zionistsâ€¦ they are terrorists"" as he used a makeshift flamethrower on demonstrators.

Wearing only jeans and sunglasses, the suspect appeared to directly target the peaceful crowd, raising fears of escalating hate crimes linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Fox News reported, citing sources from the Department of Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, that Soliman is an Egyptian national who had overstayed his visa after entering the United States during the Biden administration.

The Pearl Street Mall, a bustling four-block area in downtown Boulder, quickly turned into a scene of chaos following the attack. Authorities responded promptly, and Soliman was apprehended at the scene.

With these words, a shirtless man wreaked havoc at a peaceful demonstration in Colorado’s Boulder when he used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled Molotov cocktails at a crowd who had collected on Sunday (June 1), demanding the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

The incident , which the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is calling a ‘targeted terror attack’, has resulted in injuries to six people while the suspect himself has been taken into custody.

But what really happened? Who’s behind the tragedy? What were his motives? How have authorities reacted so far?

We try to piece together what exactly happened and get you all the answers from this heinous incident.

Around 1.26 pm on Sunday, a volunteer group known as Run For Their Lives had gathered in the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder to raise visibility for hostages who remain in Gaza as the war between Israel and Hamas continues. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that this group of people meet on a weekly basis in support of the hostages seized during the October 7 attack by Hamas.

According to authorities, they rushed to the scene after receiving a number of emergency calls from the city’s downtown area. “The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” Boulder chief of police Stephen Redfern later told a press conference.

“When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with, injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,” he added.

Eyewitnesses recounting the horror that unfolded said that a shirtless man approached the group and used a “makeshift flamethrower” and threw Molotov cocktails. According to a CBS News report, the witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled “End Zionist!” during the attack.

The suspect was also heard yelling, “Free Palestine.”

One witness, identified as Brooke Coffman, told CNN’s affiliate KUSA, that she saw a “big fire going up”. She said that she was on the phone with her mother when she “saw some flags moving around,” “people wrestling,” and “like someone was getting beat up or something.”

When she saw the flames, Coffman said she hung up on her mother, ran over to the area and called 911. “There was a kid yelling, ‘Call 911,’” she recalled. “People on the street were just yelling, ‘Call 911.’ People were running.”

Coffman added that she jumped over a small fence to get to two women who were “rolling around a bit” on the grass and in their underwear from stripping their pants. “They have really bad burns all up on their legs,” she said. One of the victims was screaming and “was wrapped in a flag.”

Videos have started circulating on social media depicting the horror — it shows a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands, pacing as the grass in front of him burns. He can be heard screaming “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” towards several people as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Who are the victims of the attack?

Six people have been injured in the incident in Boulder with the police saying that they are aged between 67-88. According to Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn, one was seriously injured and said to be in a critical condition.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado that one of the injured is an 88-year-old Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a “very loving person”. Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.

Who’s the suspect in the Colorado attack?

The suspect in the attack has been taken into custody with authorities identifying him as Mohamed Sabry Soliman. He was arrested from the scene of the crime and taken to a local hospital with minor injuries. While no charges have been officially announced, officials say they intend to hold him “fully accountable.”

FBI Denver Special Agent-in-charge Mark Michalek later told the media that they don’t believe that 45-year-old Soliman is part of a larger group or network and had acted alone in this incident.

A CNN report citing sources said that in 2005, Soliman was denied a visa to enter the United States. It’s unclear when or how the suspect entered the US.

Two enforcement officials have now told NBC News that Soliman is an Egyptian national with no prior significant contact with law enforcement. Even his social media accounts show no indication to any specific ideology.

Later, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the suspect in the attack had “illegally overstayed” a tourist visa. “He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa,” Miller wrote in a post on X. “In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit.”

Miller characterised the suspect as an “illegal alien.”

What are authorities saying about the attack?

The FBI, who arrived at the scene of the incident and now cordoned it off, is treating it as a terror attack. FBI chief Kash Patel has called it a targeted terror attack and added that US President Donald Trump has been briefed about it.

Meanwhile, Colorado Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack in Boulder, calling it “hateful act” and saying there’s “no place for this.”

Speaking to MSNBC, Polis added that “everybody deserves to be safe” and called attacks on people for their opinions, beliefs or religion “completely unacceptable.” He said his thoughts were with the victims and their families, as well as the Jewish community more broadly.

“Regardless of anybody’s views on global politics or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that this kind of act of terrorism, act of violence, is completely unacceptable. We condemn it. I know the suspect has been arrested. I hope he’s prosecuted the full extent of the law,” Polis said.

He added that the attack was a strike on free speech and stressed the importance of respectful discourse over physical violence.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X, “We’re united in prayer for the victims. Terror has no place in our great country.”

Israeli officials also expressed horror and shock at the incident. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN said on X that the Boulder attack was terrorism. In a post on X, the ambassador says, “Jewish protesters were brutally attacked”.

“Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,” he added.

Israel’s Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa’ar also condemned the attack. On X, he wrote, “Shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder, Colorado. This is pure antisemitism, fuelled by the blood libels spread in the media. I spoke with our Ambassador in the US and our Consul General in LA. I pray for those who were wounded in the attack.”

Notably, this is the second high-profile attack in less than two weeks in the US suspected to be related to the ongoing war in Gaza. Just on May 21, a man opened fire on people who had gathered for a networking event at the Capital Jewish Museum in downtown Washington, DC. A young couple who worked for the Israeli embassy were shot dead by the man identified as Elias Rodriguez , who shouted “free, free Palestine” as he was arrested.","Six people have been injured in a ‘targeted terror attack’ in Boulder, Colorado in the US after a shirtless man used a ‘makeshift flamethrower’ at an unsuspecting crowd of people who had collected, demanding the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.

The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled ‘Free Palestine’ on Sunday at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, where the group had gathered to raise attention to hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman is accused of using a makeshift flamethrower to set fire to attendees at the event calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

Soliman said he ‘hated what he called a Zionist group’, said Acting US Attorney J Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado during a press conference on Monday afternoon.

‘When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again,’ said Grewell.

‘He said that he had previously tried to purchase firearms but resorted to Molotov cocktails when he could not purchase them because he was not a legal citizen.’

Soliman could not purchase a weapon because his US visa expired, and he had taken a concealed-carry class to learn how to fire guns, said Boulder Judicial District Attorney Michael Doherty.

Law enforcement officials found 16 unused Molotov cocktails at the scene, said Doherty.

‘Sixteen, so I really want to thank law enforcement,’ he said of the rapid response.

Soliman had been planning the attack for a year, according to a federal criminal complaint.

Authorities said that four more victims were found, bringing the injured count to 12. The four newly identified victims suffered minor injuries, and two of the injured are still hospitalized, said Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn.

‘He was not on our radar in Boulder. We had no prior contacts with him,’ said Redfearn.

Federal officials on Monday said they have charged Soliman with hate crimes. He has also been charged with 16 counts of attempted murder, among other charged, with possible sentences of up to life behind bars.

Other charges against Solimon include first-degree murder although no one died, a count of first-degree assault and a count of using explosives or incendiary devices.

He faces up to 624 years in prison if convicted.

Soliman appeared in court in Boulder briefly on Monday afternoon. Prosecutors said they would bring formal charges against him at a hearing on Thursday afternoon.

He is being held on a $10million bond.

Confirmed injuries ranged from serious to minor, while the ages of the victims ranged from 52 to 88.

Boulder Rabbi Israel Wilhelm told a local news station the 88-year-old is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

The suspect, who has been described as an ‘illegal alien’ by a White House official, was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated.

Video from the scene showed a witness shouting, ‘He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,’ as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on a bare-chested suspect with containers in each hand.

Alex Osante, from San Diego, told AP News he heard a bottle break before a massive ‘boom’ erupted and people yelling and screaming.

An Israeli visitor who had joined the gathering ran up to Osante, who was in a nearby restaurant, asking for some water to help.

Osante then said the suspect threw a Molotov cocktail from behind some bushes but unintentionally set himself on fire before being arrested.

FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department, which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations, decried the attack as a ‘needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans’.

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said in a post on X: ‘This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.’

Soliman, who lives in El Paso County, Texas, was called an ‘illegal alien’ by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.

Soliman, from Egypt, first arrived in the US on a non-immigrant visa in August 2022, a border official told Fox News.

He was authorised to stay until February 2, 2023, but was then granted a work permit to stay in the country until March 2025.

The attack occurred more than a week after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington by a Chicago man who yelled: ‘I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza’ as he was being led away by police.

Israel’s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others.

They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Police in Boulder were more circumspect about a motive for the fire attack.

Police Chief Steve Redfearn said it ‘would be irresponsible for me to speculate’ while witnesses were still being interviewed.

However, he noted that the group that had gathered in support of the hostages had assembled peacefully and that injuries of the victims were consistent with them having been set on fire.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police.

The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the pedestrian mall.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis said in a statement that he was ‘closely monitoring’ the situation, adding that ‘hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable’.

A group of volunteers from the Run for Their Lives organisation silently march through the streets to raise awareness of the hostages still held in Gaza.

About 20 or 30 had turned up this Sunday, stopping at the courthouse where they usually read the names of those hostages.

""There was somebody there that I didn't even notice,"" participant Ed Victor told CBS News.

""Although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up.

""And from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat.""

Lynn Segal, 72, was also among the group gathered when a ""rope of fire"" shot in front of her and then ""two big flares"".

She said the scene at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

""There were people who were burning. I wanted to help but I didn't want to be associated with the perpetrator,"" said Ms Segal, who said she was wearing a pro-Palestinian T-shirt.

The FBI said the suspect allegedly shouted ""Free Palestine"" while using a makeshift flamethrower at a crowd of people.

FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism.

The Justice Department said the attack was a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans"".

However, local police in Boulder were cautious about describing the incident as a terror attack.

Chief Redfearn said authorities received a call at 1:26pm on Sunday, local time, that indicated a man armed with a weapon was setting people on fire.

Eight people, aged between 52 and 88 years old, were injured.

He said the injuries were consistent with reports of individuals being set on fire.

They were taken to the Boulder Community Hospital with injuries ranging in severity from ""very serious"" to ""minor"", and some were later transported to other hospitals.

At least one of them was in a critical condition, authorities said.

Law enforcement officers with a police dog walked through the streets, securing the area and examining a ""vehicle of interest"".

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs.

She said one of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and someone had wrapped her in a flag.

Ms Coffman described seeing a man who she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard, shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

Who is the alleged suspect arrested?

The FBI has identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

He was taken into custody at the scene and transported to hospital, but authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

Officials did not immediately announce any charges but said they expected to hold him ""fully accountable"".

Chief Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved in the incident.

Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, said the federal law enforcement agency was investigating the attack.

The incident came just weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC.

In that case, authorities allege a Chicago-born man opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights anti-semitism and supports Israel.

FBI director Kash Patel described the latest incident as a ""targeted terror attack"".

His words were echoed by the bureau's deputy director, Dan Bongino, in a post on X.

""This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,"" Mr Bongino said.

""We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.""

However, Chief Redfearn called for caution, saying it would be irresponsible for him to speculate on motive so soon after the incident.

""We've got dozens and dozens of people here working through this to work out exactly what happened.""

Colorado Attorney-General Phil Weiser, meanwhile, said the incident appeared to be ""a hate crime"".

""My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today's attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza,"" Mr Weiser said.

""Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views.""

Hamas-led militants stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 hostages. More than half the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel has rescued eight and recovered dozens of bodies.

Israel's ensuing military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead are civilians or combatants.

The offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced about 90 per cent of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations estimates.",

With these words, a shirtless man wreaked havoc at a peaceful demonstration in Colorado’s Boulder when he used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled Molotov cocktails at a crowd who had collected on Sunday (June 1), demanding the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

The incident , which the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is calling a ‘targeted terror attack’, has resulted in injuries to six people while the suspect himself has been taken into custody.

But what really happened? Who’s behind the tragedy? What were his motives? How have authorities reacted so far?

We try to piece together what exactly happened and get you all the answers from this heinous incident.

Around 1.26 pm on Sunday, a volunteer group known as Run For Their Lives had gathered in the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder to raise visibility for hostages who remain in Gaza as the war between Israel and Hamas continues. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that this group of people meet on a weekly basis in support of the hostages seized during the October 7 attack by Hamas.

One witness, identified as Brooke Coffman, told CNN’s affiliate KUSA, that she saw a “big fire going up”. She said that she was on the phone with her mother when she “saw some flags moving around,” “people wrestling,” and “like someone was getting beat up or something.”

When she saw the flames, Coffman said she hung up on her mother, ran over to the area and called 911. “There was a kid yelling, ‘Call 911,’” she recalled. “People on the street were just yelling, ‘Call 911.’ People were running.”

Coffman added that she jumped over a small fence to get to two women who were “rolling around a bit” on the grass and in their underwear from stripping their pants. “They have really bad burns all up on their legs,” she said. One of the victims was screaming and “was wrapped in a flag.”

Videos have started circulating on social media depicting the horror — it shows a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands, pacing as the grass in front of him burns. He can be heard screaming “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” towards several people as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Israeli officials also expressed horror and shock at the incident. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN said on X that the Boulder attack was terrorism. In a post on X, the ambassador says, “Jewish protesters were brutally attacked”.

“Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,” he added.

Israel’s Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa’ar also condemned the attack. On X, he wrote, “Shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder, Colorado. This is pure antisemitism, fuelled by the blood libels spread in the media. I spoke with our Ambassador in the US and our Consul General in LA. I pray for those who were wounded in the attack.”

Notably, this is the second high-profile attack in less than two weeks in the US suspected to be related to the ongoing war in Gaza. Just on May 21, a man opened fire on people who had gathered for a networking event at the Capital Jewish Museum in downtown Washington, DC. A young couple who worked for the Israeli embassy were shot dead by the man identified as Elias Rodriguez , who shouted “free, free Palestine” as he was arrested.","Six people have been injured in a ‘targeted terror attack’ in Boulder, Colorado in the US after a shirtless man used a ‘makeshift flamethrower’ at an unsuspecting crowd of people who had collected, demanding the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.

""There were people who were burning. I wanted to help but I didn't want to be associated with the perpetrator,"" said Ms Segal, who said she was wearing a pro-Palestinian T-shirt.

The FBI said the suspect allegedly shouted ""Free Palestine"" while using a makeshift flamethrower at a crowd of people.

FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism.

The Justice Department said the attack was a ""needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans"".

However, local police in Boulder were cautious about describing the incident as a terror attack.

Chief Redfearn said authorities received a call at 1:26pm on Sunday, local time, that indicated a man armed with a weapon was setting people on fire.

Eight people, aged between 52 and 88 years old, were injured.

He said the injuries were consistent with reports of individuals being set on fire.

They were taken to the Boulder Community Hospital with injuries ranging in severity from ""very serious"" to ""minor"", and some were later transported to other hospitals.

At least one of them was in a critical condition, authorities said.

Law enforcement officers with a police dog walked through the streets, securing the area and examining a ""vehicle of interest"".

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs.

She said one of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and someone had wrapped her in a flag.

Ms Coffman described seeing a man who she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard, shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

Who is the alleged suspect arrested?

The FBI has identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

He was taken into custody at the scene and transported to hospital, but authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

Officials did not immediately announce any charges but said they expected to hold him ""fully accountable"".

Chief Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved in the incident.

Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, said the federal law enforcement agency was investigating the attack.

The incident came just weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC.

In that case, authorities allege a Chicago-born man opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights anti-semitism and supports Israel.

FBI director Kash Patel described the latest incident as a ""targeted terror attack"".

His words were echoed by the bureau's deputy director, Dan Bongino, in a post on X.

""This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,"" Mr Bongino said.

""We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.""

However, Chief Redfearn called for caution, saying it would be irresponsible for him to speculate on motive so soon after the incident.

""We've got dozens and dozens of people here working through this to work out exactly what happened.""

Colorado Attorney-General Phil Weiser, meanwhile, said the incident appeared to be ""a hate crime"".

With these words, a shirtless man wreaked havoc at a peaceful demonstration in Colorado’s Boulder when he used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled Molotov cocktails at a crowd who had collected on Sunday (June 1), demanding the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

The incident , which the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is calling a ‘targeted terror attack’, has resulted in injuries to six people while the suspect himself has been taken into custody.

But what really happened? Who’s behind the tragedy? What were his motives? How have authorities reacted so far?

We try to piece together what exactly happened and get you all the answers from this heinous incident.

Around 1.26 pm on Sunday, a volunteer group known as Run For Their Lives had gathered in the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder to raise visibility for hostages who remain in Gaza as the war between Israel and Hamas continues. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that this group of people meet on a weekly basis in support of the hostages seized during the October 7 attack by Hamas.

According to authorities, they rushed to the scene after receiving a number of emergency calls from the city’s downtown area. “The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” Boulder chief of police Stephen Redfern later told a press conference.

“When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with, injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,” he added.

Eyewitnesses recounting the horror that unfolded said that a shirtless man approached the group and used a “makeshift flamethrower” and threw Molotov cocktails. According to a CBS News report, the witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled “End Zionist!” during the attack.

The suspect was also heard yelling, “Free Palestine.”

One witness, identified as Brooke Coffman, told CNN’s affiliate KUSA, that she saw a “big fire going up”. She said that she was on the phone with her mother when she “saw some flags moving around,” “people wrestling,” and “like someone was getting beat up or something.”

When she saw the flames, Coffman said she hung up on her mother, ran over to the area and called 911. “There was a kid yelling, ‘Call 911,’” she recalled. “People on the street were just yelling, ‘Call 911.’ People were running.”

Coffman added that she jumped over a small fence to get to two women who were “rolling around a bit” on the grass and in their underwear from stripping their pants. “They have really bad burns all up on their legs,” she said. One of the victims was screaming and “was wrapped in a flag.”

Videos have started circulating on social media depicting the horror — it shows a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands, pacing as the grass in front of him burns. He can be heard screaming “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” towards several people as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Who are the victims of the attack?

Six people have been injured in the incident in Boulder with the police saying that they are aged between 67-88. According to Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn, one was seriously injured and said to be in a critical condition.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado that one of the injured is an 88-year-old Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a “very loving person”. Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.

Who’s the suspect in the Colorado attack?

The suspect in the attack has been taken into custody with authorities identifying him as Mohamed Sabry Soliman. He was arrested from the scene of the crime and taken to a local hospital with minor injuries. While no charges have been officially announced, officials say they intend to hold him “fully accountable.”

FBI Denver Special Agent-in-charge Mark Michalek later told the media that they don’t believe that 45-year-old Soliman is part of a larger group or network and had acted alone in this incident.

A CNN report citing sources said that in 2005, Soliman was denied a visa to enter the United States. It’s unclear when or how the suspect entered the US.

Two enforcement officials have now told NBC News that Soliman is an Egyptian national with no prior significant contact with law enforcement. Even his social media accounts show no indication to any specific ideology.

Later, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the suspect in the attack had “illegally overstayed” a tourist visa. “He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa,” Miller wrote in a post on X. “In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit.”

Miller characterised the suspect as an “illegal alien.”

What are authorities saying about the attack?

The FBI, who arrived at the scene of the incident and now cordoned it off, is treating it as a terror attack. FBI chief Kash Patel has called it a targeted terror attack and added that US President Donald Trump has been briefed about it.

Meanwhile, Colorado Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack in Boulder, calling it “hateful act” and saying there’s “no place for this.”

Speaking to MSNBC, Polis added that “everybody deserves to be safe” and called attacks on people for their opinions, beliefs or religion “completely unacceptable.” He said his thoughts were with the victims and their families, as well as the Jewish community more broadly.

“Regardless of anybody’s views on global politics or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that this kind of act of terrorism, act of violence, is completely unacceptable. We condemn it. I know the suspect has been arrested. I hope he’s prosecuted the full extent of the law,” Polis said.

He added that the attack was a strike on free speech and stressed the importance of respectful discourse over physical violence.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X, “We’re united in prayer for the victims. Terror has no place in our great country.”

Israeli officials also expressed horror and shock at the incident. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN said on X that the Boulder attack was terrorism. In a post on X, the ambassador says, “Jewish protesters were brutally attacked”.

“Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,” he added.

Israel’s Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa’ar also condemned the attack. On X, he wrote, “Shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder, Colorado.

Soliman also yelled ""End Zionists!"" and ""Free Palestine"" while throwing bottles filled with flammable liquid towards the group. The incident took place at the Pearl Street outdoor mall in Boulder. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) termed it a terrorist attack.

Soliman is reportedly a foreign national who overstayed his visa. He arrived in the United States on a B-2 visa in August 2022, reported News18. According to several media reports, Soliman is an Egyptian native. However, there is no official confirmation in this regard.

The victims were aged between 67 and 88. They reportedly sustained minor to severe burn injuries. “As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” FBI Denver Field Office special agent Mark Michalek said, as reported by The Times of India.

Several videos of the attack also surfaced online.

There is an increase in antisemitic incidents across the United States.

Right on the heels of the recent political assassinations of the young betrothed couple Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim at the Israeli embassy in Washington D.C., a group of elderly Jews in Boulder Colorado was targeted Sunday in a shocking act of pro-Palestinian terrorism.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the suspect, whom the FBI has identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, hurled Molotov cocktails at people who were participating in a walk to call attention to the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza after being kidnapped by the savage terror group Hamas in the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel.

Run For Their Lives, the organizers of the walk, said, “This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.” The group had planned to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back on Sunday afternoon with a stop at the courthouse for a video. Soliman decided – allegedly – that the members of this peace walk deserved to be burned alive.

A witness said he saw a fire and then a cloud of smoke. When he got to the scene, he saw a woman “burning on the ground” and two other people who had suffered burns on their legs. Six victims in all — aged between 67 and 88 — were rushed to a hospital. Police arrived and handcuffed the agitated Soliman, who was still carrying incendiary devices and threatening bystanders, without resistance. He was heard shouting “Free Palestine” during the assault.

In a post on X, FBI Director Kash Patel correctly referred to the horrific act as a “targeted terror attack.” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn, on the other hand, declared ludicrously in an earlier press briefing that it was way too soon and “irresponsible” to speculate on motive. Because hey, the Muslim perpetrator’s shouts that the firebombing of innocent Jews will end when Palestine is free are apparently too indecipherable and nuanced for a motive to be determined.

Soliman is reportedly an Egyptian national who entered the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration and then overstayed his visa. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote on X,

Shortly after the media pushed a Hamas hoax of an Israeli massacre at an aid distribution site and on the eve of a Jewish holiday, Mohammed Soliman attacked a group of people holding a ‘Run for Their Lives’ walk to bring attention to hostages held captive by Islamic terrorists.

Mohammed, who is reportedly an illegal alien from Egypt who overstayed his visa, threw Molotov cocktails at the walkers, burning a number of people. Six marchers between the ages of 67 and 88 years have been hospitalized with burns Some of the injuries were reportedly horrific.

“One elderly woman was so severely burned that her hair was charred and she wasn’t moving while others cared for her. Others were sitting/lying down in shock, skin melted up their legs with their skin even split open and bleeding in some areas.”

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they’ve been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday’s walk. “So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn’t even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I’m just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,” said Victor. Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.

On Sunday, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and El Paso County Public Health announced that two unvaccinated, adult El Paso County residents had confirmed measles cases. Both adults, who are unrelated, were at DIA around the same time on Wednesday, May 14, and both are recovering at home.

Measles is very contagious. Here’s how to avoid it

The health officials reported on Thursday that another Colorado passenger on Turkish Airlines flight 201 that arrived in Denver on May 13 has been confirmed to be positive for measles. The vaccinated adult, who is from Arapahoe County, is recovering at home.

CDPHE said that this brings the total number of measles cases associated with an out-of-state traveler who flew while infectious to six. There were four people on the flight who were infected, including three Colorado residents, and two El Paso County residents who were at the airport.

Here’s where health officials say that individuals may have been exposed to measles. Anyone who was there should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure, and avoid public gatherings or high-risk settings.

The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, when given within 72 hours of exposure, can prevent infection. It’s also the best way to protect yourself, according to health officials.

Anyone who was at the locations is asked to immediately contact their health care provider by phone, or call an urgent care or emergency department, where you should explain you’ve likely been exposed. Calling ahead prevents additional exposures.

Measles is a highly contagious disease. Colorado health officials said that measles can spread through the air via coughs and sneezes, and can remain in the air up to two hours after the person has left. The officials said that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines provide strong protection and is the best protection.

Police said Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, injured eight people - setting at least one ablaze - at a demonstration honoring the October 7 victims who are still being held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza.

The horror unfolded during an event organized by Jewish group Run For Their Lives on Pearl Street Mall in the city's downtown just before 1.30pm local time on Sunday.

Boulder Police have not publicly identified the victims of the hate crime, but described them as four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88.

Longtime Boulder residents Rabbi Israel Wilhelm and filmmaker Lisa Effress said the oldest victim of Sunday's attack lived through the horrors of the Holocaust.

Wilhelm told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old female victim was a refugee who fled Europe during Adolf Hitler's purge. He described her as a 'very loving person'.

Effress, 55, said she is friends with the same victim, adding that she witnessed medics loading her into an ambulance at the scene on Sunday afternoon.

'It was horrible,' she told the New York Times.

Wilhelm, who is the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, added that another victim is a professor at the college.

Effress, who has lived in the ordinarily peaceful Colorado mountain town for 17 years, said the demonstration Soliman targeted has been taking place every Sunday since a few weeks after the October 7, 2023 terror attack in Israel.

A group of varying size - usually around 20 to 100 people - gathers at Pearl Street Mall in the city's downtown each week to draw attention to the 58 Israeli hostages who are still being held by Hamas militants in Gaza.

Effress usually takes part but did not this Sunday. She was across the street having lunch with her daughter, and as soon as she heard police and ambulance sirens on the mall she knew what had happened.

'I knew immediately - I just knew,' she said. 'I ran across the street, looking for everyone.'

Ed Victor, who was part of the pro-Israel walk on Sunday, said the group sometimes encounters hecklers, but he was not prepared for a vicious Molotov cocktail attack.

'We stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side,' he told CBS Colorado as he recalled the horrific incident.

'There was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up.

'And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown.

'Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire.'

Victor said one member of the group with medical experience stepped in to take care of the woman on fire, while he comforted her husband.

He said several people nearby also rushed in to help, with many bringing water from nearby restaurants and houses.

They included bystander Brian H, who did not want to give his last name. He witnessed the horror while he was dining outside nearby with his family.

Brian told CNN he saw a man launching 'Molotov cocktails' at the demonstration.

He said another man was trying to talk the suspect down, but the suspect yelled at them: 'F**k you, Zionist,' 'You all deserve to die,' and 'You've killed these children.'

'He was very erratic, shouting and spewing terrible things at different people,' Brian said.

Brian said he saw an elderly woman lying unresponsive on the ground. 'There were several people attending to her and wrapping her up, trying to ensure she was ok,' he told CNN.

He added that he brought a large bucket from the restaurant and filled it with water from a fountain in the courtyard, before pouring it on the burn victims.

Victor said there were around 30 people at the demonstration on Sunday walking their usual route while singing the Israeli national anthem, telling stories and recounting the names of the hostages.

Street performer Peter Irish described witnessing the horrors of the attack as 'traumatic'.

'I saw the aftermath,' he told CBS Colorado. 'It was like minutes after.

'I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.'

FBI Director Kash Patel called the incident a 'terror attack' while Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it 'appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted'.

Shocking footage from the scene showed several victims laying motionless on the ground beside Israel flags as witnesses rushed to pour water on their wounds.

Soliman appeared to taunt the victims while brandishing bottles of alcohol for the Molotov cocktails in each hand as smoke rose from the scene.

Wearing only jeans and sunglasses, he yelled: 'End Zionists... they are terrorists' and 'free Palestine'. He also said: 'How many children have you killed?' according to the ADL Center on Extremism.

Disturbing footage of Soliman's attack showed EMTs used stretchers to move people into ambulances while flames spread in patches across the ground.

Another video showed what looked like a burn scar across the ground close to the city's old courthouse. Blackened burned-out bottles littered the scene.

The Boulder attack occurred as law enforcement authorities in the US grapple with a sharp spike in antisemitic violence.

It comes just over a week after a man was arrested over the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC on May 22.

The victims were identified as German-Israeli dual national Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and his girlfriend Sarah Milgrim, 26.

Lischinsky had been planning to propose to Milgrim after buying a ring.

The suspect, 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez, repeatedly shouted 'Free Palestine' after shooting them dead, as police dragged him away.

Jewish human rights organization the Simon Wiesenthal Center told DailyMail.com the Boulder attack came on the first day of a religious holiday.

'On the eve of Shavuot, a sacred celebration of Jewish identity and tradition, we are forced yet again to confront a horrifying reality: Being Jewish, supporting Israel, or simply gathering as a community now makes American Jews a target,' the center's CEO Jim Berk said.

'This afternoon in Boulder, Colorado, a man threw a Molotov cocktail into a peaceful solidarity walk calling for the release of 58 hostages still held by Hamas, a humanitarian cause that should unite, not divide.'

He blamed the attack, as well as the murders of the Israeli embassy staffers, on 'months of anti-Israel propaganda, moral equivocation, and silence in the face of raging antisemitism'.

Police said Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, injured eight people - setting at least one ablaze - at a demonstration honoring the October 7 victims who are still being held hostage by Hamas militants in Gaza.

The horror unfolded during an event organized by Jewish group Run For Their Lives on Pearl Street Mall in the city's downtown just before 1.30pm local time on Sunday.

Boulder Police have not publicly identified the victims of the hate crime, but described them as four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88.

Longtime Boulder residents Rabbi Israel Wilhelm and filmmaker Lisa Effress said the oldest victim of Sunday's attack lived through the horrors of the Holocaust.

Wilhelm told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old female victim was a refugee who fled Europe during Adolf Hitler's purge. He described her as a 'very loving person'.

Effress, 55, said she is friends with the same victim, adding that she witnessed medics loading her into an ambulance at the scene on Sunday afternoon.

'It was horrible,' she told the New York Times.

Wilhelm, who is the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, added that another victim is a professor at the college.

Effress, who has lived in the ordinarily peaceful Colorado mountain town for 17 years, said the demonstration Soliman targeted has been taking place every Sunday since a few weeks after the October 7, 2023 terror attack in Israel.

A group of varying size - usually around 20 to 100 people - gathers at Pearl Street Mall in the city's downtown each week to draw attention to the 58 Israeli hostages who are still being held by Hamas militants in Gaza.

Effress usually takes part but did not this Sunday. She was across the street having lunch with her daughter, and as soon as she heard police and ambulance sirens on the mall she knew what had happened.

'I knew immediately - I just knew,' she said. 'I ran across the street, looking for everyone.'

Ed Victor, who was part of the pro-Israel walk on Sunday, said the group sometimes encounters hecklers, but he was not prepared for a vicious Molotov cocktail attack.

'We stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side,' he told CBS Colorado as he recalled the horrific incident.

'There was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up.

'And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown.

'Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire.'

Victor said one member of the group with medical experience stepped in to take care of the woman on fire, while he comforted her husband.

He said several people nearby also rushed in to help, with many bringing water from nearby restaurants and houses.

They included bystander Brian H, who did not want to give his last name. He witnessed the horror while he was dining outside nearby with his family.

Brian told CNN he saw a man launching 'Molotov cocktails' at the demonstration.

He said another man was trying to talk the suspect down, but the suspect yelled at them: 'F**k you, Zionist,' 'You all deserve to die,' and 'You've killed these children.'

'He was very erratic, shouting and spewing terrible things at different people,' Brian said.

Brian said he saw an elderly woman lying unresponsive on the ground. 'There were several people attending to her and wrapping her up, trying to ensure she was ok,' he told CNN.

He added that he brought a large bucket from the restaurant and filled it with water from a fountain in the courtyard, before pouring it on the burn victims.

Victor said there were around 30 people at the demonstration on Sunday walking their usual route while singing the Israeli national anthem, telling stories and recounting the names of the hostages.

Street performer Peter Irish described witnessing the horrors of the attack as 'traumatic'.

'I saw the aftermath,' he told CBS Colorado. 'It was like minutes after.

'I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.'

FBI Director Kash Patel called the incident a 'terror attack' while Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it 'appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted'.

Shocking footage from the scene showed several victims laying motionless on the ground beside Israel flags as witnesses rushed to pour water on their wounds.

Soliman appeared to taunt the victims while brandishing bottles of alcohol for the Molotov cocktails in each hand as smoke rose from the scene.

Wearing only jeans and sunglasses, he yelled: 'End Zionists... they are terrorists' and 'free Palestine'. He also said: 'How many children have you killed?' according to the ADL Center on Extremism.

Disturbing footage of Soliman's attack showed EMTs used stretchers to move people into ambulances while flames spread in patches across the ground.

Another video showed what looked like a burn scar across the ground close to the city's old courthouse. Blackened burned-out bottles littered the scene.

The Boulder attack occurred as law enforcement authorities in the US grapple with a sharp spike in antisemitic violence.

It comes just over a week after a man was arrested over the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC on May 22.

The victims were identified as German-Israeli dual national Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and his girlfriend Sarah Milgrim, 26.

Lischinsky had been planning to propose to Milgrim after buying a ring.

The suspect, 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez, repeatedly shouted 'Free Palestine' after shooting them dead, as police dragged him away.

Jewish human rights organization the Simon Wiesenthal Center told DailyMail.com the Boulder attack came on the first day of a religious holiday.

'On the eve of Shavuot, a sacred celebration of Jewish identity and tradition, we are forced yet again to confront a horrifying reality: Being Jewish, supporting Israel, or simply gathering as a community now makes American Jews a target,' the center's CEO Jim Berk said.

'This afternoon in Boulder, Colorado, a man threw a Molotov cocktail into a peaceful solidarity walk calling for the release of 58 hostages still held by Hamas, a humanitarian cause that should unite, not divide.'

He blamed the attack, as well as the murders of the Israeli embassy staffers, on 'months of anti-Israel propaganda, moral equivocation, and silence in the face of raging antisemitism'.

'The nonstop demonization of Israel and Zionism on our campuses, in our streets, and across digital platforms has created a climate where hate flourishes, and physical attacks—even murder—of Jews is inevitable,' Berk said.","Boulder Police have not publicly identified the victims, who range in age from 52 to 88, but witnesses said they include a Holocaust survivor and a college professor."

Police said eight people - aged between 52 and 88 - were hurt in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver. The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect had used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices. Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group, holding what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza. Police received calls around 13:26 local time (19:26 GMT) on Sunday about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn told a news conference. One of those hurt in the attack was a Holocaust survivor, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder. Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a ""very loving person"" to the BBC's US partner CBS News. The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks that appears to be related to the conflict in Gaza. A man who shouted ""free Palestine"" fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.

After Sunday's incident, witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd"", Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI's Denver office, said. He identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who was taken to hospital after being arrested and later booked into the county jail on a number of charges. He is due to appear in court later on Monday. Mr Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials told CBS. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources told the broadcaster, and had been living in Colorado Springs. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr Soliman had been given a work permit after his visa expired under the previous Biden administration. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security, said the suspect entered the country on a tourist visa and filed for asylum in September 2022.

Footage that appeared to be from the attack shows a chaotic scene: smoke filling the air, people running in multiple directions, spots of grass on fire and people injured on the ground. In images and videos posted online, a man who appears to be the suspect is seen without a shirt and holding bottles with liquid with pieces of red cloth inside them. He can be heard yelling at the crowd and appears to be advancing towards them as some rush to flee. As he screams, one woman is seen on the ground and appears injured. People surround her and a man pours water on her body. Footage shows police rushing to the scene and arresting the suspect. Police say he was taken to hospital with injuries. ""It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Mr Michalek said. ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country."" Colorado's Attorney General Phil Weiser said that from what officials knew, the attack ""appears to be hate crime given the group that was targeted"". ""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said in a statement on Sunday. ""Hate has no place in Colorado."" Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, said he was ""shocked"" by the incident and called the attack ""pure antisemitism fuelled by the blood libels spread in the media"". Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called for ""concrete action"" in response to the attack. ""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said.",The FBI calls it a suspected terror attack and says the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested and taken to the hospital with minor injuries after his alleged attack on the ""Run for Their Lives"" group that was gathering on Pearl Street, police said Sunday night.

The group is a grassroots organization that facilitates global run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. This particular chapter of the group meets on a weekly basis, police said.

Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa after entering the U.S. during the Biden administration, three Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sources told Fox News.

Colorado Terror Attack Took Place At 'Run For Their Lives' Event Calling For Release Of All Hostages In Gaza

Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa.

He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left. On Sept. 9, 2022, he filed a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

On March 29, 2023, Soliman was granted work authorization, which was valid through March of this year.

""A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien,"" Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote on X. ""He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed.""

Soliman was allegedly yelling ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, which was near the county courthouse on Pearl Street. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with weapon setting people on fire.

The FBI said eight people, ages 52 to 88, were injured and taken to the hospital. One of those victims is considered to be in critical condition.

FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of ""ideologically motivated violence,"" based on early information, evidence and witness accounts.

Soliman was booked into the Boulder County Jail on Sunday evening. The specific charges he is facing were not immediately available.

At least one was in critical condition. Soliman was also hurt and brought to a hospital for examination. Police said they believed Soliman acted alone.

Online booking records show Soliman was booked shortly before midnight on multiple felony charges, including one count of using explosives or incendiary devices to commit a felony, first-degree assault against an elderly or at-risk adult, and two counts of murder in the first degree.

So far, authorities have not announced any deaths from the Pearl Street Mall attack, though at least one victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition. The Daily Beast has reached out to the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office for comment.

Colorado law enforcement arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman on Sunday after he attacked a group of people calling for the release of hostages in Gaza, wounding eight people at the Pearl Street Mall demonstration.

“Our officers rushed as quickly as they could somewhere close to the area, and they immediately ran into a chaotic situation where a man was throwing Molotov cocktails and using other devices to hurt people,” he said in a Sunday night news conference.

Officers immediately detained the suspect and aided victims, Redfearn said. All eight victims, aged 52 to 88, were taken to hospitals in Boulder and the Denver metro area. At least one was in critical condition. Soliman was also hurt and brought to a hospital for examination. Police said they believed Soliman acted alone.

Online booking records show Soliman was booked shortly before midnight on multiple felony charges, including one count of using explosives or incendiary devices to commit a felony, first-degree assault against an elderly or at-risk adult, and two counts of murder in the first degree.

So far, authorities have not announced any deaths from the Pearl Street Mall attack, though at least one victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition. The Daily Beast has reached out to the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office for comment.

One witness told MSNBC News that he saw the victims were “having their skin melt off their bodies.”

President Trump had not publicly commented on the attack Sunday night, but a senior White House official told ABC News that Trump has been briefed.

FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek said the attack happened at a weekly event. Boulder’s Jewish Community said the demonstrators were participating in the Run for Their Lives Walk, a movement raising awareness and calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas.

“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” he said. “The suspect was heard to yell, ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.”

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek added. “Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country.”

Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino added on X: “This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.”

Redfearn initially told reporters that police were hesitant to label the attack as an act of terrorism, citing the fact that it was too early into the investigation to form such a view. In a follow-up press conference, he did not specify whether police viewed it as such but did label it an “attack.”

Mohamed Soliman, 45, unleashed hell on a group of about 30 peaceful protestors in Boulder, using a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set eight victims alight.

The casualties, which included an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, were rushed to hospital on Sunday afternoon with varying injuries but at least one was considered critical.

Soliman arrived in the United States from Egypt in August 2022, but overstayed his initial tourist visa and was ultimately handed a two-year work permit by the Biden administration, which he also overstayed, DHS sources told Fox News.

The Trump administration turned up the heat on Biden overnight, demanding answers as to why Soliman was allowed to remain in the country despite twice breaching the conditions of his visa.

'Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,' White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said. 'The Biden Admin granted the alien a visa and then, when he illegally overstayed, they gave him a work permit.

'Immigration security is national security. No more hostile migration. Keep them out and send them back.'

Soliman's latest work permit lapsed in March 2025. The sources said he had filed a claim with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services on September 9, 2022, and the status of that claim remains unclear.

Authorities revealed late on Sunday night that the casualty toll had risen from six to eight as the investigation into Soliman's alleged actions continues.

The victims, aged between 52 and 88, were taking part in the weekly Run for Their Lives event which raises awareness for the hostages being held captive in Gaza.

Two of them had to be airlifted to a burn unit with serious injuries, while the remainder suffered minor injuries. In addition to the Holocaust refugee, who has been described as a 'very loving person', a second victim is a professor at Colorado University.

The FBI was quick to describe Soliman's actions as hate motivated and an act of terror.

Officers within the FBI's Denver unit arrived at a home linked to the suspect to conduct 'court-authorized law enforcement activity' as part of the investigation.

The unassuming El Paso County home was surrounded by officers as confused neighbors noted they didn't know the residents of the address well.

'As this is an ongoing investigation, no additional information is available at this time,' the FBI said.

According to The New York Times, a woman was allowed to enter the home which had been identified as belonging to Soliman.

And according to CNN, senior officials are closely examining the 45-year-old's mental health history.

'He's shirtless, screaming, used rudimentary (explosive) devices, and stuck around to be arrested,' one source said.

The source said Soliman's method of attack did not align with a thought-out plan to cause large scale casualties.

But chilling footage clearly demonstrated that Soliman was able to exact terror upon his targets at Pearl Street Mall just before 1:30pm local time on Sunday.

Witnesses recalled the horror of seeing victims writhe around on the floor in pain as their skin melted off their bodies as Soliman paced up and down shouting vile accusations at the traumatized group.

One witness, identified only as Brian, said he watched Good Samaritans rush toward the carnage to offer assistance to the victims.

One woman was being wrapped up and attended to on the ground. Another, he said, 'looked like their skin had just melted off their bodies.

'He was very erratic, shouting and spewing terrible things at different people.' During the attack, he was shouting 'Free Palestine' at the Jewish demonstrators.

California tourist Alex Osante was eating at an Italian restaurant off Boulder's famed Pearl Street pedestrian mall when he heard a 'big boom' and saw a woman 'on fire from head to toe on fire.'

Within minutes, a nearby man ran to his table to grab two bottles of water before rushing back to victims writhing in flames on the ground.

'People were screaming and yelling … tripping over each other,' he told Daily Mail.

'The terrorist had a Molotov cocktail in his hand. He had two other bottles, and he threw a bottle at the group, and a lady caught on fire from head to toe – fully immersed in fire.

'And then the other few people, maybe four others, were also on fire – but not as bad,' he said.

He said he saw victims lying on the grass and writhing around while it felt 'way too long' until first responders arrived.

Meanwhile, Soliman appeared to taunt the victims while brandishing bottles of alcohol for the Molotov cocktails in each hand as smoke rose from the scene.

Wearing only jeans and sunglasses, he yelled: 'End Zionists... they are terrorists' and 'free Palestine'. He also said: 'How many children have you killed?' according to the ADL Center on Extremism.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, told CBS he and a group of about 30 people had gathered for their demonstration on Sunday afternoon as they had every week since the October 7 attacks.

He said they would sing songs and share the names of the hostages in Gaza each week.

Sometimes they were heckled, often they were praised and clapped by onlookers. Whatever reception they received, they never expected to be attacked.

Sharing details of Sunday's chilling events, he said: 'So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side.

'And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up.

'From my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat.

'It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire.'

While another participant who had medical experience rushed in to help the victim, Victor stayed back with her husband, providing him comfort.

Street performer Peter Irish described witnessing the horrors of the attack as 'traumatic'.

'I saw the aftermath,' he told CBS Colorado. 'It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.'

Jewish human rights organization the Simon Wiesenthal Center told DailyMail.com the Boulder attack came on the first day of a religious holiday.

'On the eve of Shavuot, a sacred celebration of Jewish identity and tradition, we are forced yet again to confront a horrifying reality: Being Jewish, supporting Israel, or simply gathering as a community now makes American Jews a target,' the center's CEO Jim Berk said.

The incident has attracted an outpouring of support for the community and outrage for the suspect's actions, particularly as the Jewish diaspora in America still reels from the shooting death of two young embassy employees just a fortnight ago.

FBI Director Kash Patel called the incident a 'terror attack' while Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it 'appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.'

New York Congressman Ritchie Torres blamed a 'hate movement' for contributing to rising anti-Semitism in the community, while Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino issued a chilling warning that his department would not rest until justice was served.

'If you aided or abetted this attack, we will find you. You cannot hide,' he said.","Mohamed Soliman, 45, unleashed terror on a group of about 30 peaceful protestors in Boulder, using a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set eight victims alight."

On Sunday afternoon, state officials shared alarming updates about a startling incident in Boulder at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall. Six people were injured after a man with a makeshift flamethrower threw an ""incendiary device"" into a group of Pro-Israel protestors, according to the Associated Press.

The suspect reportedly yelled ""Free Palestine"" as he threw the flames into the crowd.

Who Was Targeted in the Boulder Flamethrower Incident?

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene, after he allegedly set victims on fire as they peacefully rallied on behalf of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman was heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" and other criticisms of Israel during the attack.

Soliman, an Egyptian national, entered the U.S. in 2022 with authorization but has since overstayed his visa, according to authorities. Local and federal law enforcement continue to investigate the attack.

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" he continued. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists for 604 days.

The governor said he is working closely with local and federal law enforcement following Sunday's attack. Colorado Democrat Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is also Jewish, said the attack appears to have been motivated by hate.

Colorado's Democrat Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper both slammed the attack as a display of hate against the Jewish community.

""My thoughts are with the victims of the horrifying terror attack that occurred this afternoon in Boulder,"" Bennet said. ""Hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado.""

On Sunday afternoon, state officials shared alarming updates about a startling incident in Boulder at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall. Six people were injured after a man with a makeshift flamethrower threw an ""incendiary device"" into a group of Pro-Israel protestors, according to the Associated Press.

The suspect reportedly yelled ""Free Palestine"" as he threw the flames into the crowd.

Who Was Targeted in the Boulder Flamethrower Incident?

The injured individuals were a part of a group called ""Run For Our Lives — Boulder "" and had been holding demonstrations since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th, 2023, according to NBC News.

Officials confirmed that the age of the victims of the Boulder attacks ranged from 67 to 88. Their injuries also ranged from minor to severe. It does not seem like anyone died in connection with the incident.

Who Is the Suspect in the Boulder Terror Attack?

The suspect is believed to be Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who is reportedly an Egyptian citizen. Officials believe that he acted alone.

Governor Jared Polis condemned the attacks as the events unfolded Sunday afternoon.

""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,"" Polis said in a social media statement.



Boulder law enforcement officials confirmed that as of 8:15 PM on Sunday night, Broadway to 15th Street would be closed between Lawry Lane to Spruce and 15th North to Pine.

The suspect was taken to the hospital following the attack and is expected to face charges connected to the attack, according to the Associated Press.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene, after he allegedly set victims on fire as they peacefully rallied on behalf of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman was heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" and other criticisms of Israel during the attack.

Mohamed Soliman, 45, unleashed hell on a group of about 30 peaceful protestors in Boulder, using a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set eight victims alight.

The casualties, which included an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, were rushed to hospital on Sunday afternoon with varying injuries but at least one was considered critical.

Soliman arrived in the United States from Egypt in August 2022, but overstayed his initial tourist visa and was ultimately handed a two-year work permit by the Biden administration, which he also overstayed, DHS sources told Fox News.

The Trump administration turned up the heat on Biden overnight, demanding answers as to why Soliman was allowed to remain in the country despite twice breaching the conditions of his visa.

'Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,' White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said. 'The Biden Admin granted the alien a visa and then, when he illegally overstayed, they gave him a work permit.

'Immigration security is national security. No more hostile migration. Keep them out and send them back.'

Soliman's latest work permit lapsed in March 2025. The sources said he had filed a claim with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services on September 9, 2022, and the status of that claim remains unclear.

Authorities revealed late on Sunday night that the casualty toll had risen from six to eight as the investigation into Soliman's alleged actions continues.

The victims, aged between 52 and 88, were taking part in the weekly Run for Their Lives event which raises awareness for the hostages being held captive in Gaza.

Two of them had to be airlifted to a burn unit with serious injuries, while the remainder suffered minor injuries. In addition to the Holocaust refugee, who has been described as a 'very loving person', a second victim is a professor at Colorado University.

The FBI was quick to describe Soliman's actions as hate motivated and an act of terror.

Officers within the FBI's Denver unit arrived at a home linked to the suspect to conduct 'court-authorized law enforcement activity' as part of the investigation.

The unassuming El Paso County home was surrounded by officers as confused neighbors noted they didn't know the residents of the address well.

'As this is an ongoing investigation, no additional information is available at this time,' the FBI said.

According to The New York Times, a woman was allowed to enter the home which had been identified as belonging to Soliman.

And according to CNN, senior officials are closely examining the 45-year-old's mental health history.

'He's shirtless, screaming, used rudimentary (explosive) devices, and stuck around to be arrested,' one source said.

The source said Soliman's method of attack did not align with a thought-out plan to cause large scale casualties.

But chilling footage clearly demonstrated that Soliman was able to exact terror upon his targets at Pearl Street Mall just before 1:30pm local time on Sunday.

Witnesses recalled the horror of seeing victims writhe around on the floor in pain as their skin melted off their bodies as Soliman paced up and down shouting vile accusations at the traumatized group.

One witness, identified only as Brian, said he watched Good Samaritans rush toward the carnage to offer assistance to the victims.

One woman was being wrapped up and attended to on the ground. Another, he said, 'looked like their skin had just melted off their bodies.

'He was very erratic, shouting and spewing terrible things at different people.' During the attack, he was shouting 'Free Palestine' at the Jewish demonstrators.

California tourist Alex Osante was eating at an Italian restaurant off Boulder's famed Pearl Street pedestrian mall when he heard a 'big boom' and saw a woman 'on fire from head to toe on fire.'

Within minutes, a nearby man ran to his table to grab two bottles of water before rushing back to victims writhing in flames on the ground.

'People were screaming and yelling … tripping over each other,' he told Daily Mail.

'The terrorist had a Molotov cocktail in his hand. He had two other bottles, and he threw a bottle at the group, and a lady caught on fire from head to toe – fully immersed in fire.

'And then the other few people, maybe four others, were also on fire – but not as bad,' he said.

He said he saw victims lying on the grass and writhing around while it felt 'way too long' until first responders arrived.

Meanwhile, Soliman appeared to taunt the victims while brandishing bottles of alcohol for the Molotov cocktails in each hand as smoke rose from the scene.

Wearing only jeans and sunglasses, he yelled: 'End Zionists... they are terrorists' and 'free Palestine'. He also said: 'How many children have you killed?' according to the ADL Center on Extremism.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, told CBS he and a group of about 30 people had gathered for their demonstration on Sunday afternoon as they had every week since the October 7 attacks.

He said they would sing songs and share the names of the hostages in Gaza each week.

Sometimes they were heckled, often they were praised and clapped by onlookers. Whatever reception they received, they never expected to be attacked.

Sharing details of Sunday's chilling events, he said: 'So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side.

'And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up.

'From my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat.

'It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire.'

While another participant who had medical experience rushed in to help the victim, Victor stayed back with her husband, providing him comfort.

Street performer Peter Irish described witnessing the horrors of the attack as 'traumatic'.

'I saw the aftermath,' he told CBS Colorado. 'It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.'

Jewish human rights organization the Simon Wiesenthal Center told DailyMail.com the Boulder attack came on the first day of a religious holiday.

'On the eve of Shavuot, a sacred celebration of Jewish identity and tradition, we are forced yet again to confront a horrifying reality: Being Jewish, supporting Israel, or simply gathering as a community now makes American Jews a target,' the center's CEO Jim Berk said.

The incident has attracted an outpouring of support for the community and outrage for the suspect's actions, particularly as the Jewish diaspora in America still reels from the shooting death of two young embassy employees just a fortnight ago.

FBI Director Kash Patel called the incident a 'terror attack' while Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it 'appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.'

New York Congressman Ritchie Torres blamed a 'hate movement' for contributing to rising anti-Semitism in the community, while Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino issued a chilling warning that his department would not rest until justice was served.

'If you aided or abetted this attack, we will find you. You cannot hide,' he said.","Mohamed Soliman, 45, unleashed terror on a group of about 30 peaceful protestors in Boulder, using a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to set eight victims alight."

A pro-Israel group was sprayed with fire on Sunday at a peaceful demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, leaving eight people injured, almost all of them senior citizens.

A man shouting ""Free Palestine"" burned the victims with fire and threw Molotov cocktails into a crowd at a pedestrian mall in Boulder, scorching people who were walking to raise awareness for the plight of the Israeli hostages who have been held captive for more than 600 days in Gaza.

Eyewitness Alex Osante said, ""I saw fire, I saw people falling and screaming and crying and tripping. I saw the attacker have a Molotov, he had three Molotov cocktails, one of them he threw inside of a group at the group, and one lady lit on fire from head to toe and then the other four people were also injured and in the fire but not as bad as the first one.""

Another eyewitness reported seeing ""shoots of fire, linear, about 20 feet long.""

The attack comes just two weeks after another man acting in the name of Palestinians reportedly admitted to the shooting deaths of two young staffers from the Israeli Embassy in Washington outside a Jewish museum.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who is Jewish, observed that the attack occurred on the eve of the Shavuot holiday.

“As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, DC, it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" he observed.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser issued a statement saying, ""This attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,"" noting that the people gathered to support the hostages were Jewish.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, said he, his wife, and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the attack. He blamed the attack on ""blood libels against the Jewish state and people.""

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar posted on X, ""Shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder, Colorado.""

Sa'ar continued, ""This is pure antisemitism, fueled by the blood libels spread in the media. I spoke with our Ambassador in the US and our Consul General in LA. I pray for those who were wounded in the attack.""

The Jewish Community Relations Council of Colorado announced it is “outraged and heartbroken” over the attack.

The head of the group, Brandon Rattiner, added, “Our community has consistently warned that hateful and reductive rhetoric about Israel and Jews puts us in danger. We’re not being alarmist – we’re just paying attention. Violence against Jews is immoral and must end.”",Another devastating terror attack has been perpetrated against Jews here in America.

The FBI says an attack in Boulder, Colorado, that injured 12 people was a ""targeted act of violence"", and they are investigating it as an ""act of terrorism"". Officials say the suspect planned the attack for a year, watching videos on how to make Molotov cocktails before driving from his home in Colorado Springs to Boulder to target a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect told police after he was arrested that he wanted to ""kill all Zionist people"", according to court documents.

A group of people had gathered for a ""regularly scheduled, weekly, peaceful event"", which was organised by Run for Their Lives, an organisation that raises awareness for Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. Officials said that a suspect threw two incendiary devices into the group of people, and used a makeshift flamethrower to attack them. They identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45. Mr Soliman was taken to hospital shortly after the attack, the FBI said. Near the scene of the crime, officials say they found 16 unlit Molotov cocktails in a plastic container within arm's reach, as well as a weed sprayer filled with petrol.

Who is the suspect?

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged with 16 counts of attempted murder, assault and possession of an incendiary device. He has also been charged with a federal hate crime. The 45-year-old is an Egyptian national who according to an arrest warrant lived in Kuwait for 17 years before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago. The suspect told police in an interview after his arrest that he had planned the attack for a year and waited until his daughter graduated from high school, according to court documents. He had allegedly watched YouTube videos on how to make Molotov cocktails and purchased the ingredients, picking up gasoline at a station on his way to Boulder - about two hours away from his home by car. According to federal officials and the arrest warrant, Mr Soliman said he wished all Zionists were dead and that he wanted to conduct more attacks but got scared after throwing two Molotov cocktails at the group. The suspect told police he found the Run for Their Lives group in an online search, and showed up five minutes before their meeting to wait for them, officials said. Mr Soliman left an iPhone hidden in a drawer in his house with messages for his family, according to court documents. In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, the Department of Homeland Security said. Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post on X that the suspect ""is illegally in our country"" and had filed for asylum in September 2022.

Watch: How the Boulder attack unfolded using Molotov cocktails

The FBI says an attack in Boulder, Colorado, that injured 12 people was a ""targeted act of violence"", and they are investigating it as an ""act of terrorism"". Officials say the suspect planned the attack for a year, watching videos on how to make Molotov cocktails before driving from his home in Colorado Springs to Boulder to target a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect told police after he was arrested that he wanted to ""kill all Zionist people"", according to court documents.

A group of people had gathered for a ""regularly scheduled, weekly, peaceful event"", which was organised by Run for Their Lives, an organisation that raises awareness for Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. Officials said that a suspect threw two incendiary devices into the group of people, and used a makeshift flamethrower to attack them. They identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45. Mr Soliman was taken to hospital shortly after the attack, the FBI said. Near the scene of the crime, officials say they found 16 unlit Molotov cocktails in a plastic container within arm's reach, as well as a weed sprayer filled with petrol. Police said they were ""fairly confident"" that they had the lone suspect in custody. There was no evidence the suspect was connected to a wider group. ""The suspect was heard to yell 'Free Palestine' during the attack,"" said special agent in charge of the Denver field office of the FBI, Mark Michalek. He added: ""It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism.""

Who is the suspect?

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged with 16 counts of attempted murder, assault and possession of an incendiary device. He has also been charged with a federal hate crime. The 45-year-old is an Egyptian national who according to an arrest warrant lived in Kuwait for 17 years before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago. The suspect told police in an interview after his arrest that he had planned the attack for a year and waited until his daughter graduated from high school, according to court documents. He had allegedly watched YouTube videos on how to make Molotov cocktails and purchased the ingredients, picking up gasoline at a station on his way to Boulder - about two hours away from his home by car. According to federal officials and the arrest warrant, Mr Soliman said he wished all Zionists were dead and that he wanted to conduct more attacks but got scared after throwing two Molotov cocktails at the group. The suspect told police he found the Run for Their Lives group in an online search, and showed up five minutes before their meeting to wait for them, officials said. Mr Soliman left an iPhone hidden in a drawer in his house with messages for his family, according to court documents. In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, the Department of Homeland Security said. Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post on X that the suspect ""is illegally in our country"" and had filed for asylum in September 2022. Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, said on X that Mr Soliman was given a work permit by the Biden administration after he had overstayed his visa.

Who are the victims?

There are eight victims, aged between 52 and 88. Four are women and four are men. All of them have been taken to hospitals with burns and other injuries. The injuries range from ""minor"" to ""very serious"". The eldest of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, has told CBS. Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a ""very loving person"".

What is Run for their Lives?

Run for their Lives holds walking and running events around the world calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, according to their website. It says its events are not protests, but ""peaceful walks"". Their website says there are currently 230 active groups around the world, with the majority in North America and Europe. The groups meet once a week for a 1km walk wearing red T-shirts. They also carry national flags of the citizens who are among the hostages still held in Gaza. The Run for their Lives Instagram account has more than 6,000 followers. Their Facebook group has more than 2,000 members. The movement was started by a group of Israelis in California, but local events are ""independently led"", according to their website.

What is happening now?

How is the Jewish community responding?

Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, released a statement saying he was ""shocked"" by the incident, which he called ""pure antisemitism"". The Jewish community in Boulder released a statement saying: ""Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured...

• What we know about the Pearl Street Mall attack in Boulder
• Suspect in “anti-semitic terror attack” on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall charged with federal hate crime

BOULDER — Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening news briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

Police and the FBI initially said six people were injured in the attack, but law enforcement officials increased that tally to eight late Sunday night.

The victims include four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, according to Boulder police and the FBI. Authorities initially said four people were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two others were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone.

Soliman was taken to a local hospital to be medically evaluated, then was booked into the Boulder County Jail on “multiple charges.” The jail’s booking log does not show what charges Soliman faces, and police did not say.

Few details were available about Soliman late Sunday night. He does not appear to have any presence on social media — an Egypt-based fashion influencer with the same name does not match the person caught on video by witnesses — and he does not have a criminal record in Colorado, court records show.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be reached for comment on Soliman’s immigration status.

FBI Denver officials announced on social media Sunday night that agents were in El Paso County “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity” that was related to the investigation.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy, sadly,” Redfearn said. “I know a lot of people are scared right now, a lot of people are upset and questioning how this happened and why. All I know (is) Boulder has recovered before from acts of violence, and we will again recover.”

Johanna Schmidt, whose parents regularly participated in the Boulder walks held by the organization, said she was on the way to the event with her children when her mother called and told her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group and that Schmidt’s father had been burned.

Molotov cocktails are typically bottles filled with gasoline or alcohol that are then ignited and thrown.

Schmidt said the scene was “chaotic,” “absolutely horrific and shocking.” Her father sustained a second-degree burn and was released from the hospital Sunday evening.

Videos posted to social media show a woman lying on the ground while people pour water on her, as smoke and screams erupt from the area. Another video shows the shirtless man holding the bottles and shouting. In the background, bystanders can be seen huddled over someone on the ground.

“He’s right there, he’s throwing Molotov cocktails right there,” one person can be heard saying to police in one video. Police then handcuffed the man near the fountain in front of Boulder’s courthouse.

Later, a Reddit user posted photos and videos of a woman with a burned leg sitting on the lawn with paramedics, another person being loaded onto a stretcher, and people gathered in front of the building, now blocked with crime tape.

In a statement, Run for Their Lives said its “greatest concern at this moment is the well-being of the members of our group, most especially those who have been hospitalized.”

“We are dedicated to our mission that this is an international humanitarian crisis and that no one should ever be taken hostage and kept underground in tunnels without basic humanitarian needs and aid,” the group wrote.

In a statement Sunday, Gov. Jared Polis, who lives in Boulder, called the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

National Jewish organizations condemned the attack and linked it to other recent violence that’s unfolded in the United States in response to the war in Gaza, including the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., and the fire that tore through the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement that the Boulder attack was part of a “broader wave of hate.”

“It is not just the Jewish community that suffers,” Lauder wrote. “This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies. We call on law enforcement and government leaders — at every level, in every state, in every country — to act decisively.”

Israel’s campaign in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. The group still holds 58 hostages — which Sunday’s walk was meant to protest. Around a third of the hostages are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Xale Chartier was heading to a downtown parking structure when he saw first responders lining 13th Street on Sunday afternoon. His first thought was that there was some kind of mass-casualty incident.

By the time Chartier got to the courthouse, a few people were still being treated by paramedics and he could see an oily residue on the ground, along with flags and shoes scattered nearby, he said.

“It was a very grim and unsettling scene,” Chartier said. “I grew up in Boulder and I’ve never experienced anything quite like that.”

Alexandra Posnack, 19, was at her Boulder home about five minutes away from Pearl Street when friends at the scene started texting her that someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail at the group holding the weekly demonstration calling for the release of Israeli hostages.

“I’m horrified and I’m also enraged, and I will be back here next week to protest with my big-ass Israeli flag,” she said.

Brandon Hoover, 28, said the attack doesn’t seem real.

He and his girlfriend were walking down Pearl Street when suddenly there were flames and “the smell of flesh,” he said.

“I thought, ‘Holy crap, that could have been any one of us on Pearl Street,’” Hoover said. “…Once you see something that traumatic, it’s going to stick with you.”

Hours later, the scene was still being swept by hazmat, canine and bomb disposal teams, Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said. Parts of Pearl Street, including the 1200 through 1500 blocks, had been evacuated. The order remained in effect along the Pearl Street corridor from Broadway to 15th Street and from Lawry Lane to Spruce Street as of 8:11 p.m.

That section of the mall remained closed to the public as police cleared the area and investigated a “vehicle of interest,” Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Henry Bonn-Elchones, 18, was downtown getting lunch with friends when he saw smoke and burn marks and an Israeli flag on the ground by the courthouse.

He never heard an explosion. But he said first responders and law enforcement swarmed the area and later watched as two older women were loaded into ambulances.

“Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis said in a statement on social media. “While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.”

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder in Congress, called for Americans to stop the spread of antisemitism.

“Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,” said the congressman, whose district includes Boulder. “We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser wrote in a statement that the attack appears to be a hate crime and that he had offered his office’s support to Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty.

“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” he wrote. “… We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts — which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home — must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.”

BOULDER, Colo. — After a man armed with a makeshift flamethrower and shouting ""Free Palestine"" attacked a peaceful group gathered in support of Israeli hostages in Boulder Sunday afternoon, leaders in Colorado are promising to protect the Jewish community from rising anti-Semitic violence.

The attack happened around 1:30 p.m. in the area of the historic courthouse at 1235 Pearl Street. Police said eight victims ages 52 to 88 were taken to the hospital after the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd. At least one had serious injuries.

The attack happened on the eve of Shavuot, a Jewish holiday that commemorates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. The FBI said they are considering the attack an act of terrorism.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he is directing local law enforcement agencies to provide enhanced security because anyone should feel safe worshipping wherever they want.

""The state is sending out notifications to local police departments just so they know where their local Jewish places of worship are to make sure they can provide additional protection,"" Polis said. ""It's the Jewish holiday tonight and tomorrow. In addition, the state has and will continue to make grants available to places of worship that are under threat.""

Jewish Colorado, an umbrella organization that helps support Jewish people and communities across the state, said Mayor Mike Johnston's office reached out to offer additional Denver Police patrols patrols at Jewish gathering spaces.","Colorado's Jewish community is beginning a holiday with heartbreak, after a terror attack on Pearl Street in Boulder."

FBI special agent Mark Michalek told a press conference the attack was being treated as an act of terrorism.

Witnesses told the FBI the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd and shouted ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, Michalek said. The attack happened at a regularly scheduled peaceful event, he added.

Six people, aged between 67 and 88, were injured and taken to hospital, Michalek said.

""As a result of these preliminary facts it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" he said.

""Sadly attacks like this are becoming too common across the country. This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across our nation,"" Michalek said.

""Our strength as a society comes from our shared values and our

 commitment to protecting one another ... Any attempt to divide us through fear or harm has no place in Boulder, in Colorado or anywhere in our nation.""

FBI Director Kash Patel wrote earlier on X the agency was ""aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado.""

Earlier, Boulder police chief Steve Redfearn had said it was too early to call it a terror attack and it would be ""irresponsible"" for him to speculate on the motive. The suspect had been detained and was taken to hospital with minor injuries, he added.

Redfearn said initial calls to police said a man was setting people on fire.

""When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries,"" he said.

At a later press conference, Redfearn thanked emergency workers who rushed to the scene where the suspect was ""throwing Molotov cocktails, and using other devices to hurt people.""

One person was seriously injured, Redfearn said, adding it would be ""safe to say"" that person was in a critical condition.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis said he was closely monitoring the situation.

""My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror,"" he wrote on X.

""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.""

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said terror had ""no place in our great country,"" in a post on X.

""We're united in prayer for the victims of a targeted terror attack this afternoon in Boulder,"" he wrote.

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, wrote on X that the attack was not a protest.

""Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages. In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing a Molotov cocktails at them,"" he wrote.

""Make no mistake – this is not a political protest, this is terrorism. The time for statements is over. It is time for concrete action to be taken against the instigators wherever they may be.""

The conflict in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when Palestinian militant organization Hamas and other extremists invaded Israel, killing 1,200 and taking some 250 hostage.

Israel responded with a massive attack, which has since killed more than 54,300 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-controlled health authority. The figures do not distinguish between civilian and militant casualties.","Six people were injured in an incident that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) called a ""targeted terror attack"" in the western state of Colorado on Sunday.

He has since described the act of violence as “terrorism against Jews,” which has taken over American streets, especially in light of the recent attack coming weeks after a similar violent development in the US.

“Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border — it is already burning the streets of America,” the Israel envoy issued a statement. “Make no mistake — this is not a political protest, this is terrorism. The time for statements is over. It is time for concrete action to be taken against the instigators wherever they may be.”

Six elderly people in the age group ranging from 67 to 88 were injured in what the FBI are now calling a “targeted act of violence” after a male suspect shouting “Free Palestine” launched Molotov cocktails at a pro-Israel gathering this weekend. The incident took place at a rally organised by a group called “Run For Their Lives,” which is a national organisation aimed at raising awareness about Israeli hostages affected by Hamas’ Oct 7, 2023, attack.

Eyewitnesses and videos of the incident circulating online have established that the suspect – now identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman – was also hear shouting “End Zionists!” and “They are killers” at the pro-Israel gathering in Colorado.

Like Danny Danon, Rachel Amaru, an organiser with Run For Their Lives’ Boulder chapter also labelled the attack as “blatantly antisemitic,” according to CBS News.

Ed Victor, a participant in Sunday’s Boulder walk, said, “There was somebody there that I didn’t even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I’m just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown.”

Boulder’s Jewish community joined the public outcry against the attack. In a collective statement, the group of organisations wrote, “We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.”

US State Secretary Marco Rubio echoed the sentiments by calling the incident a “targeted terror attack.” Similarly, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer labelled the violent unfolding as “a vile, antisemitic act of terror.” Even the US Department of Justice went on to call it a “needless act of violence.”

The Colorado terror attack comes nearly two weeks after 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez was accused of fatally shooting two Israel Embassy staff members outside a Jewish museum in the US. Like Soliman, he too, claimed to have allegedly gone through with the violent undertaking “for Palestine,” adding that he “did it for Gaza.” While federal charges against Mohamed Soliman are expected to be announced in the coming days, Rodriguez was charged with two counts of first-degree murder.",

The delegation led by Tharoor arrived at Brasilia on Sunday.

The Indian delegations are visiting world capitals, meeting several leaders and addressing briefings, as part of India’s ongoing efforts to foster international cooperation in the global fight against terrorism, particularly in the wake of ‘Operation Sindoor’ against Pakistan-backed terror attack in Kashmir’s iconic Pahalgam, which claimed the lives of 26 tourists.

Eight people were injured on Sunday (local time) when a 45-year-old man yelled “Free Palestine"" and threw incendiary devices into a crowd in Boulder, where a demonstration to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals.

The suspect in the attack was named as Mohamed Soliman, who was hospitalised shortly after the incident.

Other than the local police, FBI Director Kash Patel described the incident as a “targeted terror attack,"" and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted.""

The suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, said Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver office, on Sunday evening at a news conference.

Boulder police confirmed Sunday night that eight people, namely four women and four men, were injured in the attack. Officials initially told news outlets that six victims had been taken to hospitals.

The 45-year-old suspect was allegedly heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" while using a ""makeshift flamethrower"" during the attack. He was also reportedly heard yelling ""They are killers"" and ""How many children you killed.""

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a news conference that Boulder dispatch received several calls reporting an incident at the county courthouse in downtown Boulder at approximately 1:26 p.m. local time (1926 GMT).

Police officers found several victims suffering from burns and other injuries upon arriving at the scene.

An organizer with Run For Their Lives, a group that holds weekly walks to raise awareness about Israeli hostages held in Gaza -- told local television station KUSA that a man was waiting with bottles when they arrived at the historic courthouse near 13th and Pearl Streets.

The suspect threw the bottles, burning multiple people, including a woman who was severely injured and had to roll on the ground to extinguish the flames, according to the report.

One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, said the report.

In a social media post, FBI Director Kash Patel said, ""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado.""

White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor Stephen Miller said in a social media post that the terror attack was committed by ""an illegal alien.""

Fox News reported that Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa after entering the United States, citing Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sources.

CNN reported authorities are working to determine whether the suspect may have suffered mental health issues.

""He's shirtless, screaming, used rudimentary (explosive) devices, and stuck around to be arrested,"" a source told CNN.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack as a ""heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community"" in a statement.

""Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" he added. ■",

“This attack happened at a regularly scheduled, weekly peaceful event. Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd. The suspect was heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack,” FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek told reporters.

Michalek said the suspect has been identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

“It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence, and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” he said, adding there is no evidence at this time suggesting the suspect was connected to a wider group.

Fox News reporter Bill Melugin, citing three sources at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman is an Egyptian national living in the US illegally with a visa overstay. He entered the country during the Biden administration.

“At this point, we do not believe that there is an additional suspect at large,” said Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn.

According to Redfearn, one of the victims was “very seriously injured” in the attack.

Earlier, Redfearn said the suspect “was taken into custody without incident” and was transported to a hospital with minor injuries.

Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Michalek said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organised by Run for Their Lives, an organisation devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law"".

""The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,"" he said.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the US over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in anti-Semitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel led by President Donald Trump to brand pro-Palestinian protests as anti-Semitic.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs.

He was booked into the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to county records. His bond has been set at $10 million.

Police in the city of Boulder said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which took place shortly before 1:30 pm (1930 GMT) at a demonstration outside a mall.

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said the ""violent antisemitic attack"" occurred at Sunday's ""Run for Their Lives"" event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community in solidarity with hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the war in Gaza.

""Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,"" he said, adding that ""the suspect was heard to yell: 'Free Palestine!'""

Boulder Police said that eight victims, four men and four women aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals.

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that ""at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition.""

The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.

In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt ""very, very scared"" after hearing about the attack near his workplace.

Sunday's attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted ""Free Palestine,"" was arrested.

Boulder Police Chief Redfearn insisted it was ""way too early to speculate motive,"" but FBI chief Kash Patel described the attack as ""a targeted terror attack.""

The incident took place at the Pearl Street Mall, a well-known outdoor space in Boulder, located about 30 miles (48 km) from Denver, according to police. Eight individuals, ranging in age from 52 to 88, sustained injuries.

The FBI has classified the incident as a suspected terror attack, stating that the suspect used Molotov cocktails, a makeshift flamethrower, and other incendiary devices.

The shirtless suspect was captured on camera shouting at the group and holding what appeared to be Molotov cocktails in both hands at the time of his arrest.

The attack occurred during a weekly demonstration organized by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israel group that holds walks in the outdoor mall to show support for Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a news conference that officers received reports at approximately 1:26 p.m. local time (8:26 p.m. BST) about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire.

Mark Michalek, director of the FBI’s Denver office, confirmed that the suspect used a “makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” according to witness accounts.

Chief Redfearn added that the incendiary devices included Molotov cocktails aimed at the crowd.

The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, according to Michalek.

Government officials told CBS News that Soliman is an Egyptian national who entered California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, which expired in February 2023. He had been residing in Colorado Springs.

Footage from the attack shows a chaotic scene: smoke fills the air, people run in different directions, grass burns, and injured individuals lie on the ground.

The BBC has not independently verified the images and videos posted online, which show a shirtless man holding containers filled with liquid and red cloths. He can be heard shouting at the crowd and advancing toward them as some attempt to flee.

One woman lies on the ground, appearing to be injured. People surround her, and someone pours water over her body.

The suspect was apprehended by police who quickly arrived at the scene. Authorities say he was taken to a hospital with injuries.

“The FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism, and it is clear this was a targeted act of violence,” said Michalek. “Unfortunately, such incidents are becoming increasingly common across the country.”

This attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the United States in the past two weeks linked to the Gaza conflict.

On May 22, a man shouting “Free Palestine” fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred during a networking event organized by a Jewish group.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said the attack appears to be a hate crime based on the group that was targeted.

“Violence is never the answer to resolving differences, no matter how strongly people may feel about world events or the Israeli-Hamas conflict,” Weiser stated on Sunday. “Hate has no place in Colorado.”

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar expressed his shock at the incident, calling it “pure antisemitism.”

“I am appalled by the horrific antisemitic terror attack that targeted Jews in Boulder, Colorado,” he said in a post on X. “This is unfiltered antisemitism, intensified by the media’s spread of blood libels.”

Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, also condemned the attack, describing it as terrorism and calling for “concrete action” in response.

“Jewish demonstrators were brutally attacked,” Danon said in a post on X.. “Terrorism against Jews isn’t limited to the Gaza border; it is now spreading through the streets of the United States.”","Authorities in Colorado reported that a man shouting ""Free Palestine"" threw Molotov cocktails at a gathering in support of Israeli detainees, resulting in"

The FBI said it was investigating the incident as a ""targeted terror attack"" and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

He was booked into the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to county records. His bond has been set at $10 million.

Police in the city of Boulder said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which took place shortly before 1:30 pm (1930 GMT) at a demonstration outside a mall.

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said the ""violent antisemitic attack"" occurred at Sunday's ""Run for Their Lives"" event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community in solidarity with hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the war in Gaza.

""Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,"" he said, adding that ""the suspect was heard to yell: 'Free Palestine!'""

Boulder Police said that eight victims, four men and four women aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals.

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that ""at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition.""

The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.

In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt ""very, very scared"" after hearing about the attack near his workplace.

Sunday's attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted ""Free Palestine,"" was arrested.

Boulder Police Chief Redfearn insisted it was ""way too early to speculate motive,"" but FBI chief Kash Patel described the attack as ""a targeted terror attack.""

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that the suspect was a foreign national who ""illegally overstayed (his) visa.""

Fox News and CBS both cited US officials as saying Soliman was an Egyptian national.

The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident.

Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also described the Boulder incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" while Attorney General Pam Bondi termed it ""a horrific anti-Semitic attack.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle expressed revulsion.

""Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror,"" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement. ""Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.""

Several organizations also decried the violence.

Fox News reporter Bill Melugin, citing three sources at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman is an Egyptian national living in the US illegally with a visa overstay. He entered the country during the Biden administration.

“At this point, we do not believe that there is an additional suspect at large,” said Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn.

According to Redfearn, one of the victims was “very seriously injured” in the attack.

Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty said: “That is my promise — to hold the attacker fully accountable.”

Earlier, Redfearn said the suspect “was taken into custody without incident” and was transported to a hospital with minor injuries.

FBI Director Kash Patel said on X that federal authorities are treating the incident as a “targeted terror attack.”

Twelve people were injured in an attack on Sunday on a group of people in the United States city of Boulder, Colorado, who were campaigning for the release of captives held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza.

Police arrested a man who allegedly threw incendiary devices towards people. The FBI said it was investigating the attack as an “act of terror”.

In a social media post, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar described the attack as an anti-Semitic act.

Here is what we know so far:

A group of people were walking in a “regularly scheduled, weekly peaceful event” aimed at galvanising support for the release of captives held in Gaza when they were attacked, according to an official news release shared by the Boulder Police Department. The police were called at 1:36pm (10:36 GMT).

The news release said that witnesses saw the attacker using a makeshift flamethrower as he lobbed incendiary devices – meant to start fires – at the gathering.

Witness videos circulating on social media showed a shirtless man appearing to hold two glass bottles, which looked like Molotov cocktails.

A Molotov cocktail is a simple incendiary weapon. It comprises a bottle filled with a flammable liquid covered by a wick, which is lit on fire before the bottle is thrown at a target.

They are named after Vyacheslav Molotov, the foreign minister of the Soviet Union during World War II. In 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, and the country experienced heavy bombing. Molotov insisted that the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs, only food parcels.

In response, the Finns threw handmade explosives towards Soviet tanks, sarcastically dubbing them “Molotov cocktails”.

Where did the attack happen?

Sunday’s attack took place at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall, a pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder that stretches for four blocks. It is home to retail stores, art galleries and restaurants. The mall is a two-minute drive, or 1.1km (0.7 miles), from the University of Colorado, Boulder.

What was the event the victims were attending?

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser released a statement on Sunday, saying that the attack was “against a group that meets weekly on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza”.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a nonprofit focused on combatting anti-Semitism – which was accused of double standards in January for defending a salute made by billionaire Elon Musk at an inauguration rally for US President Donald Trump – released a statement saying the event was part of an international campaign called Run for Their Lives.

The campaign involves weekly gatherings worldwide where Jewish community members run and walk in solidarity with the captives taken by Hamas and other Palestinian groups during their attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023.

Run for Their Lives gatherings take place in 230 locations in 24 countries, including Brazil, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Spain. Groups in multiple US states participate in this event and there are two locations in Colorado: one in Boulder and the other in Denver’s Washington Park.

Armed Palestinian groups took about 251 captives from Israel on October 7. While some captives were returned in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, or rescued, others have died. Some 59 people taken from Israel are believed to remain in Gaza and Israel believes that 35 of them have died.

Since October 7, Israeli military bombardment and other attacks have killed more than 61,700 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Government Media Office.

Who was the suspect and what did he say during the attack?

The Boulder attack suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, from El Paso County, according to the Boulder Police news release.

Soliman was also injured in the attack, though the nature of his injuries is unclear.

The release says that Soliman was medically evaluated at a hospital and then was booked in the Boulder County Jail for multiple charges.

According to the news release, Soliman yelled, “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, claimed in a post on X that the Boulder attack was carried out by an “illegal alien”.

Without naming Soliman, Miller said the suspect had overstayed a tourist visa granted to him by the government of former US President Joe Biden. “In response, the Biden administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” Miller wrote.

President Donald Trump blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a “terrible tragedy”, he posted on X.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify Soliman’s immigration status in the US.

What do we know about the victims?

Twelve people were injured in the attack, according to the US Department of Justice. These include four women and four men, aged between 52 and 88.

The victims were taken to hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area.

Another four victims were named later, according to authorities.

Soliman has been charged with a federal hate crime as well as an array of state charges, including attempted murder and use of an explosive device, according to an affidavit by the US Department of Justice.

The affidavit said Soliman had planned the attack for more than a year. Investigators found 14 Molotov cocktails filled with petrol or gasoline near where the suspect was detained.

On Tuesday, the family of the suspect was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,” US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an “antisemitic terror attack”.

The Boulder Police Department called the FBI within minutes of the attack, the police news release said. The FBI is investigating this as a “terror” attack.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino wrote in an X post. “We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.”

FBI Director Kash Patel also wrote in an X post that his team was investigating the “targeted terror attack” and that FBI agents and law enforcement were at the scene already.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in an X post that the department was working on the situation with its “interagency partners”, including the FBI.

What is the latest on the ground?

According to an update by the Boulder Police Department on X on Monday at 05:53 GMT, all roads in downtown Boulder have been reopened except for a block on Pearl Street, “which should be reopened in the next few hours”.

What have been the reactions?

“We will continue to ensure that justice is pursued swiftly, support is provided to victims and their communities and preventative action is taken to protect everyone’s safety,” FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek was quoted as saying in the Boulder Police news release.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn acknowledged that many residents were scared, and had questions about the attack. “Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover. I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive,” he said, in the same news release.

Israeli Foreign Minister Saar wrote on X on Monday: “Shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder, Colorado. This is pure Antisemitism, fueled by the blood libels spread in the media.” He did not elaborate on what he meant by this.

US Senate Democratic Party Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X: “Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror. Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.”

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X on Sunday: “We’re united in prayer for the victims of a targeted terror attack this afternoon in Boulder.”

Many Democrats have released online statements condemning the attack and describing it as anti-Semitic.

Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on X: “My thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the Jewish community that once again appears to have been targeted with hate. We all have a responsibility to stop these antisemitic acts.”

House Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, released a statement on X, saying: “Our heartfelt prayers are with all of our Jewish brothers and sisters impacted by this unconscionable act of terror, and we thank law enforcement for their swift response. Antisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed. We stand with the Jewish community today and always.”

Twelve people were injured in an attack on Sunday on a group of people in the United States city of Boulder, Colorado, who were campaigning for the release of captives held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza.

Police arrested a man who allegedly threw incendiary devices towards people. The FBI said it was investigating the attack as an “act of terror”.

In a social media post, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar described the attack as an anti-Semitic act.

Here is what we know so far:

A group of people were walking in a “regularly scheduled, weekly peaceful event” aimed at galvanising support for the release of captives held in Gaza when they were attacked, according to an official news release shared by the Boulder Police Department. The police were called at 1:36pm (10:36 GMT).

The news release said that witnesses saw the attacker using a makeshift flamethrower as he lobbed incendiary devices – meant to start fires – at the gathering.

Witness videos circulating on social media showed a shirtless man appearing to hold two glass bottles, which looked like Molotov cocktails.

A Molotov cocktail is a simple incendiary weapon. It comprises a bottle filled with a flammable liquid covered by a wick, which is lit on fire before the bottle is thrown at a target.

They are named after Vyacheslav Molotov, the foreign minister of the Soviet Union during World War II. In 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, and the country experienced heavy bombing. Molotov insisted that the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs, only food parcels.

In response, the Finns threw handmade explosives towards Soviet tanks, sarcastically dubbing them “Molotov cocktails”.

Where did the attack happen?

Sunday’s attack took place at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall, a pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder that stretches for four blocks. It is home to retail stores, art galleries and restaurants. The mall is a two-minute drive, or 1.1km (0.7 miles), from the University of Colorado, Boulder.

What was the event the victims were attending?

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser released a statement on Sunday, saying that the attack was “against a group that meets weekly on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza”.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a nonprofit focused on combatting anti-Semitism – which was accused of double standards in January for defending a salute made by billionaire Elon Musk at an inauguration rally for US President Donald Trump – released a statement saying the event was part of an international campaign called Run for Their Lives.

The campaign involves weekly gatherings worldwide where Jewish community members run and walk in solidarity with the captives taken by Hamas and other Palestinian groups during their attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023.

Run for Their Lives gatherings take place in 230 locations in 24 countries, including Brazil, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Spain. Groups in multiple US states participate in this event and there are two locations in Colorado: one in Boulder and the other in Denver’s Washington Park.

Armed Palestinian groups took about 251 captives from Israel on October 7. While some captives were returned in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, or rescued, others have died. Some 59 people taken from Israel are believed to remain in Gaza and Israel believes that 35 of them have died.

Since October 7, Israeli military bombardment and other attacks have killed more than 61,700 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Government Media Office.

Who was the suspect and what did he say during the attack?

The Boulder attack suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, from El Paso County, according to the Boulder Police news release.

Soliman was also injured in the attack, though the nature of his injuries is unclear.

The release says that Soliman was medically evaluated at a hospital and then was booked in the Boulder County Jail for multiple charges.

According to the news release, Soliman yelled, “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, claimed in a post on X that the Boulder attack was carried out by an “illegal alien”.

Without naming Soliman, Miller said the suspect had overstayed a tourist visa granted to him by the government of former US President Joe Biden. “In response, the Biden administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” Miller wrote.

President Donald Trump blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a “terrible tragedy”, he posted on X.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify Soliman’s immigration status in the US.

What do we know about the victims?

Twelve people were injured in the attack, according to the US Department of Justice. These include four women and four men, aged between 52 and 88.

The victims were taken to hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area.

Another four victims were named later, according to authorities.

Soliman has been charged with a federal hate crime as well as an array of state charges, including attempted murder and use of an explosive device, according to an affidavit by the US Department of Justice.

The affidavit said Soliman had planned the attack for more than a year. Investigators found 14 Molotov cocktails filled with petrol or gasoline near where the suspect was detained.

On Tuesday, the family of the suspect was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,” US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an “antisemitic terror attack”.

The Boulder Police Department called the FBI within minutes of the attack, the police news release said. The FBI is investigating this as a “terror” attack.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino wrote in an X post. “We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.”

FBI Director Kash Patel also wrote in an X post that his team was investigating the “targeted terror attack” and that FBI agents and law enforcement were at the scene already.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in an X post that the department was working on the situation with its “interagency partners”, including the FBI.

What is the latest on the ground?

According to an update by the Boulder Police Department on X on Monday at 05:53 GMT, all roads in downtown Boulder have been reopened except for a block on Pearl Street, “which should be reopened in the next few hours”.

What have been the reactions?

“We will continue to ensure that justice is pursued swiftly, support is provided to victims and their communities and preventative action is taken to protect everyone’s safety,” FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek was quoted as saying in the Boulder Police news release.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn acknowledged that many residents were scared, and had questions about the attack. “Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover. I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive,” he said, in the same news release.

Israeli Foreign Minister Saar wrote on X on Monday: “Shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder, Colorado. This is pure Antisemitism, fueled by the blood libels spread in the media.” He did not elaborate on what he meant by this.

US Senate Democratic Party Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X: “Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror. Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.”

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X on Sunday: “We’re united in prayer for the victims of a targeted terror attack this afternoon in Boulder.”

Many Democrats have released online statements condemning the attack and describing it as anti-Semitic.

Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on X: “My thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the Jewish community that once again appears to have been targeted with hate. We all have a responsibility to stop these antisemitic acts.”

House Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, released a statement on X, saying: “Our heartfelt prayers are with all of our Jewish brothers and sisters impacted by this unconscionable act of terror, and we thank law enforcement for their swift response. Antisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed. We stand with the Jewish community today and always.”

What do we know about the victims?

Twelve people were injured in the attack, according to the US Department of Justice. These include four women and four men, aged between 52 and 88.

The victims were taken to hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area.

Another four victims were named later, according to authorities.

Soliman has been charged with a federal hate crime as well as an array of state charges, including attempted murder and use of an explosive device, according to an affidavit by the US Department of Justice.

The affidavit said Soliman had planned the attack for more than a year. Investigators found 14 Molotov cocktails filled with petrol or gasoline near where the suspect was detained.

On Tuesday, the family of the suspect was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “We are investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it,” US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an “antisemitic terror attack”.

The Boulder Police Department called the FBI within minutes of the attack, the police news release said. The FBI is investigating this as a “terror” attack.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino wrote in an X post. “We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.”

FBI Director Kash Patel also wrote in an X post that his team was investigating the “targeted terror attack” and that FBI agents and law enforcement were at the scene already.

Twelve people were injured in an attack on Sunday on a group of people in the United States city of Boulder, Colorado, who were campaigning for the release of captives held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza.

Police arrested a man who allegedly threw incendiary devices towards people. The FBI said it was investigating the attack as an “act of terror”.

In a social media post, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar described the attack as an anti-Semitic act.

Here is what we know so far:

A group of people were walking in a “regularly scheduled, weekly peaceful event” aimed at galvanising support for the release of captives held in Gaza when they were attacked, according to an official news release shared by the Boulder Police Department. The police were called at 1:36pm (10:36 GMT).

The news release said that witnesses saw the attacker using a makeshift flamethrower as he lobbed incendiary devices – meant to start fires – at the gathering.

Witness videos circulating on social media showed a shirtless man appearing to hold two glass bottles, which looked like Molotov cocktails.

A Molotov cocktail is a simple incendiary weapon. It comprises a bottle filled with a flammable liquid covered by a wick, which is lit on fire before the bottle is thrown at a target.

They are named after Vyacheslav Molotov, the foreign minister of the Soviet Union during World War II. In 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, and the country experienced heavy bombing. Molotov insisted that the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs, only food parcels.

In response, the Finns threw handmade explosives towards Soviet tanks, sarcastically dubbing them “Molotov cocktails”.

Where did the attack happen?

Sunday’s attack took place at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall, a pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder that stretches for four blocks. It is home to retail stores, art galleries and restaurants. The mall is a two-minute drive, or 1.1km (0.7 miles), from the University of Colorado, Boulder.

What was the event the victims were attending?

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser released a statement on Sunday, saying that the attack was “against a group that meets weekly on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza”.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a nonprofit focused on combatting anti-Semitism – which was accused of double standards in January for defending a salute made by billionaire Elon Musk at an inauguration rally for US President Donald Trump – released a statement saying the event was part of an international campaign called Run for Their Lives.

The campaign involves weekly gatherings worldwide where Jewish community members run and walk in solidarity with the captives taken by Hamas and other Palestinian groups during their attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023.

Run for Their Lives gatherings take place in 230 locations in 24 countries, including Brazil, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Spain. Groups in multiple US states participate in this event and there are two locations in Colorado: one in Boulder and the other in Denver’s Washington Park.

Armed Palestinian groups took about 251 captives from Israel on October 7. While some captives were returned in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, or rescued, others have died. Some 59 people taken from Israel are believed to remain in Gaza and Israel believes that 35 of them have died.

Since October 7, Israeli military bombardment and other attacks have killed more than 61,700 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Government Media Office.

Who was the suspect and what did he say during the attack?

The Boulder attack suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, from El Paso County, according to the Boulder Police news release.

Soliman was also injured in the attack, though the nature of his injuries is unclear.

The release says that Soliman was medically evaluated at a hospital and then was booked in the Boulder County Jail for multiple charges.

According to the news release, Soliman yelled, “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, claimed in a post on X that the Boulder attack was carried out by an “illegal alien”.

Without naming Soliman, Miller said the suspect had overstayed a tourist visa granted to him by the government of former US President Joe Biden. “In response, the Biden administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” Miller wrote.

President Donald Trump blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a “terrible tragedy”, he posted on X.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

In a social media post, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar described the attack as an anti-Semitic act.

Here is what we know so far:

A group of people were walking in a “regularly scheduled, weekly peaceful event” aimed at galvanising support for the release of captives held in Gaza when they were attacked, according to an official news release shared by the Boulder Police Department. The police were called at 1:36pm (10:36 GMT).

The news release said that witnesses saw the attacker using a makeshift flamethrower as he lobbed incendiary devices – meant to start fires – at the gathering.

Witness videos circulating on social media showed a shirtless man appearing to hold two glass bottles, which looked like Molotov cocktails.

A Molotov cocktail is a very simple incendiary weapon. It comprises a bottle filled with a flammable liquid covered by a wick, which is lit on fire before the bottle is thrown at a target.

They are named after Vyacheslav Molotov, the foreign minister of the Soviet Union during World War II. In 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, and the country experienced heavy bombing. Molotov insisted that the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs, only food parcels.

In response, the Finns threw handmade explosives towards Soviet tanks, sarcastically dubbing them “Molotov cocktails”.

Where did the attack happen?

The attack took place at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall, a pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder that stretches four blocks. It is home to retail stores, art galleries and restaurants. The mall is a two-minute drive, or 1.1km (0.7 miles), from the University of Colorado, Boulder.

What was the event the victims were attending?

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser released a statement on Sunday, saying that the attack was “against a group that meets weekly on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza”.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a nonprofit focused on combating anti-Semitism – which was accused of double standards in January for defending a salute made by billionaire Elon Musk at an inauguration rally for US President Donald Trump – released a statement saying the event was part of an international campaign called “Run for Their Lives”.

The campaign involves weekly gatherings worldwide where Jewish community members run and walk in solidarity with the captives taken by Hamas and other Palestinian groups during their attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023.

Run for Their Lives gatherings take place in 230 locations in 24 countries, including Brazil, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Spain. Groups in multiple US states participate in this event and there are two locations in Colorado: one in Boulder and the other one in Denver’s Washington Park.

Armed Palestinian groups took about 251 captives from Israel on October 7. While some captives were returned in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, or rescued, others have died in captivity. Some 59 captives are believed to remain in captivity, and Israel believes that 35 of them have died.

Since October 7, Israeli military bombardment and other attacks have killed more than 61,700 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Government Media Office.

Who was the suspect and what did he say during the attack?

The Boulder attack suspect has been identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old man from El Paso County, according to the Boulder Police news release.

Soliman was also injured in the attack, though the nature of his injuries is unclear.

The release says that Soliman was medically evaluated at a hospital and then was booked in the Boulder County Jail for multiple charges. The release did not specify what exactly these charges were.

According to the news release, Soliman yelled, “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, claimed in a post on X that the Boulder attack was carried out by an “illegal alien”.

Without naming Soliman, Miller said the suspect had overstayed a tourist visa granted to him by the government of former US President Joe Biden. “In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” Miller wrote.

Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify Soliman’s immigration status in the US.

Law enforcement officials said that eight people were injured. These include four women and four men, aged between 52 and 88.

The victims were taken to hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area.

The Boulder Police Department called the FBI within minutes of the attack, the news release said. The FBI is investigating this as a terror attack.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino wrote in an X post. “We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.”

FBI Director Kash Patel also wrote in an X post that his team was investigating the “targeted terror attack” and that FBI agents and law enforcement were at the scene already.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, wrote in an X post that the department was working on the situation with its “interagency partners”, including the FBI.

What is the latest on ground?

According to an update by the Boulder Police Department on X on Monday at 05:53 GMT, all roads in downtown Boulder have been reopened except for a block on Pearl Street, “which should be reopened in the next few hours”.

What have been the reactions?

“We will continue to ensure that justice is pursued swiftly, support is provided to victims and their communities and preventative action is taken to protect everyone’s safety,” FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek was quoted saying in the Boulder Police news release.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn acknowledged that many residents were scared, and had questions about the attack. “Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover. I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive,” he was quoted saying in the same news release.

Israeli Foreign Minister Saar wrote on X on Monday: “Shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder, Colorado. This is pure Antisemitism, fueled by the blood libels spread in the media.” He did not elaborate on what he meant by this.

US Senate Democratic Party Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X: “Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror. Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.”

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X on Sunday: “We’re united in prayer for the victims of a targeted terror attack this afternoon in Boulder.”

Many Democrats have released online statements condemning the attack and describing it as anti-Semitic.

Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on X: “My thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the Jewish community that once again appears to have been targeted with hate. We all have a responsibility to stop these antisemitic acts.”

House Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, released a statement on X, saying: “Our heartfelt prayers are with all of our Jewish brothers and sisters impacted by this unconscionable act of terror, and we thank law enforcement for their swift response. Antisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed. We stand with the Jewish community today and always.”

Who is the suspect?

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged with 16 counts of attempted murder, assault and possession of an incendiary device. He has also been charged with a federal hate crime. The 45-year-old is an Egyptian national who according to an arrest warrant lived in Kuwait for 17 years before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago. The suspect told police in an interview after his arrest that he had planned the attack for a year and waited until his daughter graduated from high school, according to court documents. He had allegedly watched YouTube videos on how to make Molotov cocktails and purchased the ingredients, picking up gasoline at a station on his way to Boulder - about two hours away from his home by car. According to federal officials and the arrest warrant, Mr Soliman said he wished all Zionists were dead and that he wanted to conduct more attacks but got scared after throwing two Molotov cocktails at the group. The suspect told police he found the Run for Their Lives group in an online search, and showed up five minutes before their meeting to wait for them, officials said. Mr Soliman left an iPhone hidden in a drawer in his house with messages for his family, according to court documents. In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, the Department of Homeland Security said. Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post on X, external that the suspect ""is illegally in our country"" and had filed for asylum in September 2022. Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, said on X that Mr Soliman was given a work permit by the Biden administration after he had overstayed his visa.

Who are the victims?

There are eight victims, aged between 52 and 88. Four are women and four are men. All of them have been taken to hospitals with burns and other injuries. The injuries range from ""minor"" to ""very serious"". The eldest of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, has told CBS. Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a ""very loving person"".

What is Run for their Lives?

Run for their Lives holds walking and running events around the world calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, according to their website.

The groups meet once a week for a 1km walk wearing red T-shirts. They also carry national flags of the citizens who are among the hostages still held in Gaza. The Run for their Lives Instagram account has more than 6,000 followers. Their Facebook group has more than 2,000 members. The movement was started by a group of Israelis in California, but local events are ""independently led"", according to their website.

The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices.

Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group and had what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Police got calls around 13:26 local time (20:26 BST) about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a news conference.

Officers who responded found multiple people injured, including those with burns.

Witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a “makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” said Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI’s Denver office.

Redfearn added those devices included Molotov cocktails being tossed at the crowd.

In images and videos posted online, but not yet verified by the BBC, a man who appears to be the suspect is seen without a shirt and holding bottles with liquid with a piece of red cloth inside. He can be heard yelling at the crowd and appears to be advancing on them as some rush to flee.

As he screams, one woman is on the ground and appears injured. People surround her and one man pours water on her body.

Footage shows police rushing to the scene and arresting the suspect. Police say he was taken to the hospital with injuries.

The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks related to the conflict in Gaza.

A man who shouted “free Palestine” fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.

Colorado’s Attorney General Phil Weiser said that from what officials know the attack “appears to be hate crime given the group that was targeted”.

Reportedly yelling Free Palestine and End Zionist, Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails, injuring at least eight people -four women and four men- aged 52 to 88. Four of them were hospitalized locally, and two were airlifted to a Denver burn unit. At least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn explained. Rabbi Israel Wilhelm told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

Soliman, who arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa which expired in Feb. 2023, was arrested without resistance and treated for minor injuries. The FBI classified the incident as a targeted terror attack and is investigating it as ideologically motivated violence. It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism, FBI Special Agent Mark Michalek said.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” Michalek also pointed out. “This is an example of how perpetrators of violence continue to threaten communities across the nation.”

The incident took place during a peaceful demonstration to raise awareness for hostages taken during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 and abducted 251 people. FBI Director Kash Patel described it as a targeted terror attack, and Deputy Director Dan Bongino noted it was being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence.

The Boulder event follows a rise in antisemitic attacks in the US, with the pro-Israel advocacy group Anti-Defamation League noting nine episodes targeting Jewish communities in the past 11 months. Last month, Elias Rodriguez was shouting Free Palestine as he killed two Israeli embassy employees outside Washington's Jewish Museum. We're witnessing a global campaign of intimidation and terror deliberately directed against the Jewish people, the ADL highlighted.

We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza, Boulder's Jewish community said in a joint statement.","A foreign national identified as the 45-year-old Egyptian Mohamed Sabry Soliman, Sunday, attacked a group participating in a weekly event in Boulder, Colorado, supporting Israeli hostages held by the terrorist organization Hamas in Gaza."

Launched as a short-term emergency measure in 2015, the decade-long wolf cull is a morally outrageous tactic to divert public attention from the root cause of caribou declines — the province’s failure to significantly address habitat destruction — said Pacific Wild co-founder Ian McAllister.

The BC government spent a decade killing wolves to protect caribou. Now, critics warn that despite questions about its effectiveness, ethics and impact on the rest of the environment, the government is moving to make the wolf cull a permanent part of its strategy.

The future for caribou and wolves is looking even more dire given the federal and provincial plans to fast-track permitting and reduce environmental assessments for development, McAllister said.

The province’s five-year wolf cull cycle is set to expire with no indication the province has any plans to end or even limit the practice, he added.

“It’s obviously a new twist on the war on wolves,” he said.

Over the past decade, 2,543 wolves and 48 cougars have been killed, the Ministry of Water, Land, and Resource Stewardship (WLRS) told Canada’s National Observer in an email.

The ministry didn’t specify if or when the practice would end.

“Predator management will end when caribou populations recover to a level where they are expected to be self-sustaining,” the email said.

Killing wolves in large numbers has resulted in small and temporary gains for at-risk herds, while continuing to inflict great suffering on the highly social, intelligent predators, said Lesley Fox, executive director of The Fur-Bearers, an animal protection charity.

A total of 362 wolves were shot from helicopters this winter — marking the second-highest death toll since the province launched its predator reduction program in 2015, according to numbers the charity obtained through a freedom of information request.

The NDP government reneged on its promise to enact species-at-risk legislation with binding measures to protect critical habitat for threatened species, like BC caribou populations — which continue to lose the mature forests they rely on to logging, mining and oil and gas projects, as well as wildfire, Fox said.

The province uses euphemisms like “predator management,” or words like “culls” or “removals” to soften the message of what's really happening on the ground, she stressed.

“This is a mass slaughter of a keystone species that is integral to healthy ecosystems.”

The ministry said the wolf and cougar culls came at a cost of about $1.4 million. An additional 15 wolves were live-captured and relocated to the US in Colorado to reintroduce the animals in the state.

The cost of the wolf cull over the past five years has averaged more than $1.5 million annually — with the killing of each wolf costing an estimated $6,000 or more.

The goal of the provincial wolf cull is to wipe out entire packs and reduce populations by more than 80 per cent, so there are fewer than three wolves per 1,000 square kilometres in caribou habitat, said McAllister.

Wolves are hazed from the air and semi-automatic weapons are used to shoot them, which limits accuracy, he said. The province also uses “Judas wolves” — where animals are fitted with GPS radio collars and released to rejoin their pack, so the entire group can be hunted down.

The province issued a new caribou recovery strategy in November 2024 that includes prioritizing threatened herds most likely to recover — those with pre-existing habitat protections — over the next 20 to 40 years. The plan does not identify which herds will get attention.

In the short term, intensive population management measures, such as culling predators — like wolves and cougars, but also possibly bears and wolverines — are mentioned. Maternity penning, in which pregnant caribou and young calves are protected from predators and disturbances, is also recommended in the strategy.

The plan’s objectives include conserving and protecting key caribou habitats and accelerating the restoration of key damaged areas. However, the strategy offers no timelines for action, nor any caribou or habitat recovery targets, or what “short-term” means when it comes to killing wolves.

Wolf culls will only delay caribou extinction without habitat protection and recovery, said Rob Serrouya, co-director of the Wildlife Science Centre for Biodiversity Pathways.

However, wolves that follow typical prey like deer, moose and elk into disturbed forests come into contact with caribou, putting additional pressure on their populations, Serrouya said.

It will likely take decades to protect or restore vital habitat areas that sustain caribou populations, he said. The targeted removal of wolves in tandem with hunting the deer and moose — plus supplemental feeding of caribou or maternal penning — could prevent the most vulnerable herds from blinking out in the meantime.

There is little public appetite for wolf culls, which are ineffective and result in incremental gains for caribou, Fox said.

Close to 60 per cent of more than 15,000 people surveyed opposed predator reduction as a recovery measure, the province found before launching its five-year cull in 2021. The top three recovery measures supported were habitat protection, land restoration and managing industry operations.

However, opposition to wolf culls typically softens if they see they are paired with strong, effective habitat protections, Serrouya said.","The province is looking to make its ""short-term emergency"" measure of shooting wolves to protect caribou a permanent practice in lieu of protecting habitat, critics warn."

“As this is an ongoing investigation, no additional information is available at this time.”

An unidentified woman was allowed to enter the home, which the FBI confirmed belonged to Soliman, the New York Times reported.

Neighbors of the terror suspect said that a family with three kids lived at the residence, but they did not know them well.

Soliman was arrested and identified as the suspect in the fiery attack against a group of people, primarily comprised of the elderly, participating in a walk for the Israeli hostages still being held captive by Hamas.

He was allegedly waiting for the group at one of their scheduled stops on their walk.

Pictures showed a shirtless Soliman holding two bottles of clear liquid that were allegedly used as a homemade incendiary device.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said.

Michalek named the suspect as Mohamed Soliman, who was hospitalized shortly after the attack.

FBI Director Kash Patel also described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be ""a hate crime given the group that was targeted."" Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved.

""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel.

In a statement, the group said the walks have been held every week since then for the hostages, ""without any violent incidents until today.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law"".

""The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,"" he said.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel, led by President Donald Trump, to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. His administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite U.S. universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

In a post to X, a social network, Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Soliman had overstayed his visa and been allowed to work by the previous administration. He said it was further evidence of the need to ""fully reverse"" what he described as ""suicidal migration.""

Reuters was not able to independently verify the suspect's immigration status. When asked about Soliman, the Department of Homeland Security said more information would be provided as it became available.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

""Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water,'"" Coffman said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said it was an antisemitic attack.

""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism,"" he said on X.

The attack follows last month's arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fueled polarization in the United States over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

Law enforcement officials have now identified eight victims from Sunday’s attack at Pearl Street Mall during a protest demanding the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Four women and four men aged between 52 and 88 were taken to Denver metro hospitals, at least one of whom was in a critical condition.

He saw the suspect with a tank on his back, carrying a bottle. “I saw fabric coming out of it, and I quickly realized that it was a Molotov cocktail,” Brian said. “One had already exploded right in front of us.”

Brian ran to the courthouse and saw the suspect yelling “F--- you Zionists, you’re killing all my people.” After filming the man on his phone in case the police needed identification, he called 911.

“I told her to hurry, there are people literally having the skin melt off their bodies,” Brian said. People were taking buckets of water out of a nearby fountain to pour on the victims “to make them more comfortable” while others were bringing large buckets of iced water from a nearby restaurant to extinguish the flames.

“There was one man, probably in his fifties or sixties, he was in shock,” Brian said. “His leg from his ankle to foot, all the way up to his buttocks was melted. His skin was basically melted off his leg.”

Brian said there were “deep cuts” up to an inch thick in several of the victims with blood “pouring” out of them. He also detailed two elderly women who had been injured: “(One) her whole back leg from her calf up to her butt, the skin was falling off the leg. The other woman had burns all over her hands, ankles, feet, elbows. They looked stunned (and) confused.”

Brian said the smell of gasoline at the crime scene was potent. “I thought it initially was alcohol, but I assume it was gasoline, which again singed the pants off of some of these elderly women and the shirt off of one of the women that I can’t really, frankly, I can’t imagine... I hope she survives.”

Police identified the suspect as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian who was arrested at the scene.

Online booking records show Soliman was booked shortly before midnight on multiple felony charges, including one count of using explosives or incendiary devices to commit a felony, first-degree assault against an elderly or at-risk adult, and two counts of murder in the first degree.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin added that the suspect filed for asylum in September 2022.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, has been charged with 16 counts of attempted murder after injuring twelve with a makeshift flamethrower on Sunday and yelling ""Free Palestine"" at a group of people participating in a pro-Israel demonstration, according to authorities.

Soliman was medically evaluated at a local hospital before being booked into the Boulder County jail on charges including two counts of murder in the first degree and one count of explosives or incendiary devices used during a felony, the Boulder Police Department said. He is being held on a $10 million bond.

A federal complaint states that Soliman was charged with a hate crime ""involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin,"" and that he told investigators ""he researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them.""

He allegedly told police, ""he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,"" and that he would conduct an attack again.

""He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,"" the FBI said.

Federal officials noted in the complaint that a black plastic container with a yellow top was found near Soliman when he was arrested.

""In the black plastic container were at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Ball jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles,"" the complaint read. ""Near the black plastic container was a backpack weed sprayer, potentially containing a flammable substance.""

Police shared Soliman's mugshot on Monday and confirmed that no victims have died.

Four women and four men aged between 52 and 88 were taken to Denver metro hospitals, police added.

Officers said they responded to the scene just before 1:30 p.m. at the intersection of 13th Street and Pearl Street. A man was reportedly with a weapon and setting people on fire, witnesses said.

The event where the attack took place was being held at a pedestrian mall where demonstrators gathered to call for the release of Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.

The attack happened barely a week after a man who also yelled ""Free Palestine"" was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside the D.C. Capital Jewish Museum.

President Donald Trump called it a ""horrific attack"" that ""WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America.""

""He came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""He must go out under “TRUMP” Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!""

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis responded to the incident, calling the attack a “heinous act of terror.”

""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation,"" Polis wrote on X.

According to Denver-based nonprofit JEWISHcolorado, which is a part of the Jewish Federations of North America, the Run for Their Lives walk is a recurring event in downtown Boulder.

""We have been walking in Boulder, CO since Thanksgiving 2023 to show solidarity for the plight of the hostages still being held in Gaza,"" according to the organization’s website. ""We will continue to walk until all hostages are released.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Monday that he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said. ""I trust the American authorities will prosecute the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law and will do everything possible to prevent future attacks against innocent civilians. The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped.""

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the ""act of terror"" was being investigated as an ""act of ideologically motivated violence.""

""We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” he added.","Four women and four men aged between 52 and 88 were taken to Denver metro hospitals, police added. "

“Any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world. There’s no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real,” Hegseth said in a keynote address at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference in Singapore on Saturday. “And it could be imminent. We hope not. But it certainly could be.”

While Hegseth stopped short of explicitly committing the U.S. to defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion or blockade by the Chinese military, he vowed that President Donald Trump would not allow it to happen.

President Trump has also said that Communist China will not invade Taiwan on his watch. “So, our goal is to prevent war, to make the costs too high, and peace the only option,” Hegseth said. “But if deterrence fails, and if called upon by my commander in chief, we are prepared to do what the Department of Defense does best — fight and win — decisively.”

‘ALLIES AND PARTNERS MUST DO THEIR PART’: Hegseth’s message to Asian Pacific allies was the same as the Trump administration’s to its European allies: increase defense spending and military capabilities.

“We ask — and indeed, we insist — that our allies and partners do their part on defense. Sometimes, that means having uncomfortable and tough conversations,” Hegseth said, arguing that only a strong, united defense will deter China from acting.

“President Trump does not seek war. We do not seek to dominate or strangle China. To encircle or provoke. We do not seek regime change, nor will we instigate or disrespect a proud and historic culture,” Hegseth said. At the same time, he warned that China aims to become “a hegemonic power” hoping “to dominate and control” the Indo-Pacific. “Through its massive military buildup and growing willingness to use military force to achieve its goals, including grey zone tactics and hybrid warfare, China has demonstrated that it wants to fundamentally alter the region’s status quo.”

“China’s behavior towards its neighbors and the world is a wake-up call, and an urgent one,” he said. “We cannot look away, and we cannot ignore it.”

“I urge all our allies and partners to seize this moment with us. Our defense spending must reflect the dangers and threats that we face today. Because deterrence doesn’t come on the cheap, just ask the American taxpayer.”

TOUTS ‘TRILLION DOLLAR BUDGET’: “We are preparing for war in order to deter war — to achieve peace through strength,” Hegseth said. “We’re equipping American warfighters with the most advanced capabilities so that we remain the strongest and most lethal fighting force in the world.”

“President Trump is spending — for the first time ever — over $1 trillion next year to do this. A 13% increase in American defense spending. The Golden Dome for America, our new sixth-generation fighter — the F-47, our new stealth bomber — the B-21, new submarines, destroyers, hypersonics, drones, you name it. It’s all part of it. The best military equipment in the world.”

“When our opponents know that our military is armed with the most capable weapons systems, wielded by skilled warriors with the will to prevail, they are less likely to challenge us on the battlefield — which is the point,” he said. Hegseth concluded his remarks by saying, “And we look out in this room, and we look to you — to our allies and to our partners — to join us in this important work. Our time is now. The threats we face will not wait. And nor can we.”

HAPPENING TODAY: RUSSA-UKRAINE PEACE TALKS: Expectations could hardly be lower for today’s second round of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations meeting in Istanbul today.

The two sides are expected to trade memoranda outlining their respective terms for peace, but Moscow has so far shown no interest in ending the war anytime soon. Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned a request from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a face-to-face meeting in Turkey.

“The Ukrainian proposal we presented to the Russians is logical and realistic,” Zelensky said last night on the eve of the talks. “The Russians have not shared their ‘memorandum’ with anyone. We don’t have it, the Turkish side doesn’t have it, and the American side doesn’t have the Russian document either.”

The Ukrainian delegation is led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, while the Russian delegation is headed by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin, who Zelensky said appears to have no authority to make any decisions. “Despite this, we will attempt to achieve at least some progress on the path toward peace,” he said.

“Russia is attempting to delay negotiations and prolong the war in order to make additional battlefield gains,” the Institute for the Study of War concluded in its latest battlefield assessment, noting that Russia has amassed 125,000 personnel to the borders of Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts, an indication that Russian territorial ambitions extend beyond the four oblasts it has already claimed to have annexed.

‘A BRILLIANT OPERATION’: Meanwhile, in an audacious and sophisticated drone attack Sunday, Ukraine delivered an impressive tactical and psychological blow to Russia’s air forces, destroying more than 40 Russian planes as they sat on the ground deep in Russian territory.

“A brilliant operation was carried out,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address. “It took place on enemy territory and was aimed exclusively at military targets — specifically, the equipment used in strikes against Ukraine. Russia suffered truly significant losses, entirely justified and deserved.”

Zelensky said the operation was launched from inside Russian territory, utilized 117 drones, and damaged or destroyed 34% of Russia’s “strategic cruise missile carriers.”

“Our personnel operated across multiple Russian regions, in three different time zones,” Zelensky said. “And the people who assisted us were withdrawn from Russian territory before the operation. They are now safe. It is genuinely satisfying when something I authorized a year and six months ago comes to fruition and deprives Russians of over forty units of strategic aviation.”

“Russia will likely struggle to replace the aircraft that Ukrainian forces damaged and destroyed,” the ISW assessed, and the loss will, at least, “temporarily constrain Russia’s ability” to conduct long-range drone and missile strikes into Ukraine. “The Ukrainian drone operation will force Russian officials to consider redistributing Russia’s air defense systems to cover a much wider range of territory and possibly deploying mobile air defense groups that can more quickly react to possible similar Ukrainian drone strikes in the future.”

‘MAGA GIRL’ FIRED AFTER SHARPLY CRITICIZING HEGSETH’S MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Self-proclaimed “MAGA girl,” Gabrielle Cuccia — who, until she was fired Friday was chief Pentagon correspondent at One America News — apparently lost her job for complaining too vigorously about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s restrictions on the media.

In a lengthy post on her Substack page, Cuccia — who served in the White House in 2017 and 2018 — took Hegseth to task for failing to hold briefings, locking reporters out of the briefing room, and restructuring their movements in the building.

“If you want the best case study for the death of the MAGA movement — look no further than the Department of Defense,” she wrote. “If there’s any place where we should be asking questions, demanding transparency, and applying pressure — it’s here.”

“I was asked to turn in my Pentagon badge to my bureau chief,” Cuccia told CNN, and was subsequently fired. It’s not clear if OAN acted on its own or after complaints from the Pentagon.

Cuccia stressed in her opinion piece that she remained staunchly pro-Trump and made clear he held some of her Pentagon reporters colleagues in low regard. “Don’t go calling me deep state,” she wrote. “It’s pretty obvious how I feel about fake news outlets like CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and ABC.”

But she also bristled at Hegseth’s latest directive restricting reporters’ access to the building’s hallways, arguing that the practice — which dates back to World War II — threatened national security.

“The Pentagon wants to paint a picture that journalists are freely roaming classified spaces, sneaking into SCIFs, and leaking top-secret information,” Cuccia wrote. “And that is simply not true. There are security cameras everywhere, protocols in place, and quite frankly, it would be painfully obvious if a reporter was in a space they didn’t belong.”

“The Pentagon’s press protocol forces you to trust your government — and you shouldn’t,” Cuccia wrote on X after her firing. “I Love My Country, Not My Government,” she wrote. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t want my government to succeed.”

Some think it's very reflective of his character

Donald Trump was roasted after cameras picked up his phone background. The US President sparked a frenzy after his lock screen was revealed on Saturday night (May 31). After speaking to journalists, political commentator Harry Sisson took to TikTok to share his thoughts.

In the short clip, he said: ""Donald Trump was holding a press conference and his phone screen was seen. Can you take a guess as to what the lockscreen photo is? If you guess himself, you'd be absolutely right."" Amusingly, the President seems to have chosen an AI-enhanced photo of himself that was taken during his most recent election campaign.

Harry asked viewers: ""Do you know how narcissistic you have to be to want yourself to be the home screen? You'd be constantly looking at yourself. Normal people might have a photo of themselves and others - family or friends - but no, in Donald Trump's world, it's a constant him.""

Content cannot be displayed without consent

Harry claims this isn't out of character for Trump, who seems to enjoy hanging portraits of himself up on his walls. The TikToker argued: ""He just loves admiring what he looks like, but it's very strange.""

The clip has garnered 71,000 likes and plenty of comments. One responder said: ""Narcissism on full display.""

Another theorised: ""Did he Google that and download it? Probably not, but it's a funny thought."" And a third added: ""It's like people who have portraits of themselves hanging at home. It's so odd.""

However, others didn't see anything wrong with the picture Trump chose for his lock screen. One said: ""So? I have myself too its quite common actually."" Another asked: ""Is this a problem?"" And a third pointed out: ""Lots of people do that, no?""

It's not the first time Trump has seemed to be preoccupied by his image. Earlier this year, he demanded one of his Presidential portraits to be taken down immediately.

In a bizarre rant, he told wrote on TruthSocial: ""Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves. But the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor... was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.""

He said the artist behind the painting, Sarah Boardman, managed to create a ""wonderful"" portrait of Obama during his stint in the White House. Trump said: ""He looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst.

""She must have lost her talent as she got older. In any event, I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one.""",President Donald Trump has found himself the subject of ridicule (once again) due to the image that was spotted on his phone lock screen.

1247367695,20250602,2025,0,10,10,1,1,0.0,6,1,6,-0.48209366391185,US,,2,"Colorado, United States",US,USCO,39.0646,-105.327,CO,20250602,https://www.cpr.org/2025/06/02/report-fracking-chemicals-underreported-colorado/,www.cpr.org,cpr,Chemicals used in fracking in Colorado underreported under new state law,"A report released by environmental advocacy groups last week claims oil and gas companies haven’t been complying with a 2022 state law that requires them to disclose all chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations.

As a result, the analysis estimates operators have injected 30 million pounds of unknown chemicals into the ground throughout Colorado in the past 21 months. According to the report, Chevron and its subsidiaries make up over half of the undisclosed wells.

Physicians for Social Responsibility published the report on May 20 along with Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado, FracTracker Alliance and the Colorado Sierra Club.

It comes almost three years after Gov. Jared Polis signed HB 22-1348, a first-in-the-nation law that requires oil and gas companies to report chemical compounds used during hydraulic fracturing, a process better known as fracking, and drilling. The law took effect in July 2023.

“Whoever knows the information has to supply the information fundamentally,” Ramesh Bhatt, the conservation chair of the Colorado Sierra Club, told CPR News. “The result of this lack of compliance with the 2022 law now is that we know nothing about 30 million pounds of chemicals that have been used.”

The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission is responsible for holding companies accountable for compliance. A spokesperson for the commission said no punishment has been levied on those companies who have not filed.

In a written statement, the commission said, “The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission (ECMC) takes enforcement seriously and has been working with operators to ensure compliance with Colorado law, including reporting requirements … We are committed to holding any violators accountable.”

The spokesperson also said, “On May 21 at a public hearing, ECMC Commissioner Mike Cross committed to reviewing and reporting back to the Commission about the claims made in the report.”

To comply with the law, an oil and gas company uses FracFocus, a nationwide database maintained by state environmental health officials to track chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.

The registry, however, allows companies to decline to identify a specific ingredient if it’s seen as a “trade secret.” The law removed the exemptions in Colorado, requiring oil and gas operators to disclose the chemical information through the Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission. The regulator must then compile and publish the information for a final review on a publicly accessible website.

In a written statement, Patty Erico, a Chevron spokesperson, said the company has disclosed chemicals in compliance with the Colorado law. She acknowledged some of those products used in the fracking process are registered as “trade secrets,” but wrote it’s up to chemical manufacturers, not operators, to register the exact ingredients with state regulators.

Environmentalists and the lawmakers disagree with that interpretation.

“The oil and gas people are saying, ‘Oh, it's not really us. It's the chemical companies that are supposed to do this compliance.’ And the bill's pretty clear on that,” Meg Froelich, one of the state representatives who sponsored HB 22 -1348, said. “It says both chemical companies and operators, there’s a whole section of the bill on operators.”

Lynn Granger, the President and CEO of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, called the report ""disappointing"" since it equates a noncompliance issue with public health concerns. She said the oil and gas industry has every intention of following state regulations, and it’s struggled with IT issues on chemical disclosure forms.

“We have had a pretty large regulatory overhaul over the last several years on both the energy and management commission,” Granger told CPR News. “Our industry has come to the table and it is an industry that wants to comply with every regulation that we have on the books in the state of Colorado.""

Granger said that the Colorado Oil and Gas Association is meeting with ECMC this week to discuss compliance issues.

Fracking requires pumping liquid into porous rock to break it apart and stimulate the release of trapped oil and gas. Some of that liquid contains chemical additives to more effectively open cracks and stimulate oil and gas production.

According to FracFocus, different chemical compounds are found in different mixes, and “dozens of other fluids” that act as corrosion prevention, lubricant for the well and prevents bacteria growth. Meaning a cocktail of chemicals are used throughout the process.

But, according to Froelich, one of the state representatives who sponsored HB 22 -1348, operators have failed to follow the requirements according to the law, or how the lawmakers were hoping.

“It's commensurately disappointing, frustrating, makes you mad, that it turns out that there just really isn't compliance.” Froelich told CPR News.

She compared the bill to a nutritional label.

“The industry pushed back, saying, ‘Coca-Cola can't be required to disclose its secret formula.’ Yeah, that's true. But what's on the side of a Coke can? All the ingredients in Coke. That's all that our bill says,” Froelich said. “Tell us the chemicals that you're putting down (to) process oil and gas operations in Colorado.”

She says she’s looking to Polis to push for compliance.

“I look forward to the administration adhering to their own environmental goals. I mean, the governor signed this bill, it's in line with what he wants to accomplish in Colorado,” Froelich said. “This is his agency under his purview. So we hope to see compliance.”

The report suggests Chevron and its subsidiaries have the most undisclosed reports. A Chevron well exploded in Weld County earlier this year and an investigation is still underway determining how much crude oil, chemicals and water were released.

The well took nearly five days to fully secure and resulted in a rush of chemicals onto homes, cars, fences and multiple creeks.

Chevron told CPR News that the “vast majority of components in fracturing fluid are also used in well-known everyday products,” and pointed to water, salt and citric acid as examples.

Most of the undisclosed drilling happened in Weld County, according to a map created by FracTracker.

Brett Cavanaugh, the Director of the Weld County Oil and Gas Energy Department, said he is working closely with ECMC to help operators follow the reporting requirements. Cavanaugh is a county employee.

“ECMC is evaluating next steps to obtain compliance, including potential enforcement action. We are committed to holding any violators accountable,” Cavanaugh wrote in an emailed statement.

The amount of undisclosed chemicals was found by looking at the amount of chemicals reported as trade secrets on FracFocus and comparing those to the chemicals disclosed to ECMC.

The discrepancies between the two added up to 30 million pounds, according to the report.

Gary Allison is the main data analyst behind the report and the founder of OpenFF, an open-source site that takes FracFocus data and makes it more accessible. The environmental groups contracted Allison to analyze the data used in the report.

“In that FracFocus database, we can tell when a well has been fractured and the chemicals that have been added to it based on the FracFocus data. And then we can use that to see if it's actually also been disclosed in the ECMC database.” Allison said.

By comparing the two databases, he found that a little under 40% of the wells had been disclosed by their legal deadline. Allison added that the 30 million undisclosed chemical estimate isn’t even the whole picture.

Allison said the law requires companies to disclose chemicals used in both the fracking and earlier in the process during drilling. But the drilling information is not yet available.

“There's no record of the drilling chemicals in Colorado’s data yet,” Allison said. “The amount of undisclosed chemicals is way higher than we put in the report.”

ECMC can issue fines up to $15,000 a day for not complying with the 2022 law. At the lowest fine of $200 per day, over $37 million in penalties could be levied against Colorado oil and gas operators, according to the report.

“There's a fiscal impact, there's a fairness aspect,” Froelich said. “If the companies that are not in compliance, which the report mentions are big operators in Colorado, that's not fair that they can not comply and not be fined and not be held accountable.”

Bhatt, the conservation chair of the Colorado Sierra Club, told CPR News that it’s “too early to know” if there will be a lawsuit filed for the missing information.

As a result, the analysis estimates operators have injected 30 million pounds of unknown chemicals into the ground throughout Colorado in the past 21 months. According to the report, Chevron and its subsidiaries make up over half of the undisclosed wells.

Physicians for Social Responsibility published the report on May 20 along with Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado, FracTracker Alliance and the Colorado Sierra Club.

It comes almost three years after Gov. Jared Polis signed HB 22-1348, a first-in-the-nation law that requires oil and gas companies to report chemical compounds used during hydraulic fracturing, a process better known as fracking, and drilling. The law took effect in July 2023.

“Whoever knows the information has to supply the information fundamentally,” Ramesh Bhatt, the conservation chair of the Colorado Sierra Club, told CPR News. “The result of this lack of compliance with the 2022 law now is that we know nothing about 30 million pounds of chemicals that have been used.”

The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission is responsible for holding companies accountable for compliance. A spokesperson for the commission said no punishment has been levied on those companies who have not filed.

In a written statement, the commission said, “The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission (ECMC) takes enforcement seriously and has been working with operators to ensure compliance with Colorado law, including reporting requirements … We are committed to holding any violators accountable.”

The spokesperson also said, “On May 21 at a public hearing, ECMC Commissioner Mike Cross committed to reviewing and reporting back to the Commission about the claims made in the report.”

To comply with the law, an oil and gas company uses FracFocus, a nationwide database maintained by state environmental health officials to track chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.

The registry, however, allows companies to decline to identify a specific ingredient if it’s seen as a “trade secret.” The law removed the exemptions in Colorado, requiring oil and gas operators to disclose the chemical information through the Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission. The regulator must then compile and publish the information for a final review on a publicly accessible website.

In a written statement, Patty Erico, a Chevron spokesperson, said the company has disclosed chemicals in compliance with the Colorado law. She acknowledged some of those products used in the fracking process are registered as “trade secrets,” but wrote it’s up to chemical manufacturers, not operators, to register the exact ingredients with state regulators.

Environmentalists and the lawmakers disagree with that interpretation.

“The oil and gas people are saying, ‘Oh, it's not really us. It's the chemical companies that are supposed to do this compliance.’ And the bill's pretty clear on that,” Meg Froelich, one of the state representatives who sponsored HB 22 -1348, said. “It says both chemical companies and operators, there’s a whole section of the bill on operators.”

Lynn Granger, the President and CEO of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, called the report ""disappointing"" since it equates a noncompliance issue with public health concerns. She said the oil and gas industry has every intention of following state regulations, and it’s struggled with IT issues on chemical disclosure forms.

“We have had a pretty large regulatory overhaul over the last several years on both the energy and management commission,” Granger told CPR News. “Our industry has come to the table and it is an industry that wants to comply with every regulation that we have on the books in the state of Colorado.""

Granger said that the Colorado Oil and Gas Association is meeting with ECMC this week to discuss compliance issues.

Fracking requires pumping liquid into porous rock to break it apart and stimulate the release of trapped oil and gas. Some of that liquid contains chemical additives to more effectively open cracks and stimulate oil and gas production.

According to FracFocus, different chemical compounds are found in different mixes, and “dozens of other fluids” that act as corrosion prevention, lubricant for the well and prevents bacteria growth. Meaning a cocktail of chemicals are used throughout the process.

But, according to Froelich, one of the state representatives who sponsored HB 22 -1348, operators have failed to follow the requirements according to the law, or how the lawmakers were hoping.

“It's commensurately disappointing, frustrating, makes you mad, that it turns out that there just really isn't compliance.” Froelich told CPR News.

She compared the bill to a nutritional label.

“The industry pushed back, saying, ‘Coca-Cola can't be required to disclose its secret formula.’ Yeah, that's true. But what's on the side of a Coke can? All the ingredients in Coke. That's all that our bill says,” Froelich said. “Tell us the chemicals that you're putting down (to) process oil and gas operations in Colorado.”

She said the oil and gas industry has every intention of following state regulations, and it’s struggled with IT issues on chemical disclosure forms.

“We have had a pretty large regulatory overhaul over the last several years on both the energy and management commission,” Granger told CPR News. “Our industry has come to the table and it is an industry that wants to comply with every regulation that we have on the books in the state of Colorado.""

Granger said that the Colorado Oil and Gas Association is meeting with ECMC this week to discuss compliance issues.

Fracking requires pumping liquid into porous rock to break it apart and stimulate the release of trapped oil and gas. Some of that liquid contains chemical additives to more effectively open cracks and stimulate oil and gas production.

According to FracFocus, different chemical compounds are found in different mixes, and “dozens of other fluids” that act as corrosion prevention, lubricant for the well and prevents bacteria growth. Meaning a cocktail of chemicals are used throughout the process.

But, according to Froelich, one of the state representatives who sponsored HB 22 -1348, operators have failed to follow the requirements according to the law, or how the lawmakers were hoping.

“It's commensurately disappointing, frustrating, makes you mad, that it turns out that there just really isn't compliance.” Froelich told CPR News.

She compared the bill to a nutritional label.

“The industry pushed back, saying, ‘Coca-Cola can't be required to disclose its secret formula.’ Yeah, that's true. But what's on the side of a Coke can? All the ingredients in Coke. That's all that our bill says,” Froelich said. “Tell us the chemicals that you're putting down (to) process oil and gas operations in Colorado.”

She says she’s looking to Polis to push for compliance.

“I look forward to the administration adhering to their own environmental goals. I mean, the governor signed this bill, it's in line with what he wants to accomplish in Colorado,” Froelich said. “This is his agency under his purview. So we hope to see compliance.”

The report suggests Chevron and its subsidiaries have the most undisclosed reports. A Chevron well exploded in Weld County earlier this year and an investigation is still underway determining how much crude oil, chemicals and water were released.

The well took nearly five days to fully secure and resulted in a rush of chemicals onto homes, cars, fences and multiple creeks.

Chevron told CPR News that the “vast majority of components in fracturing fluid are also used in well-known everyday products,” and pointed to water, salt and citric acid as examples.

Most of the undisclosed drilling happened in Weld County, according to a map created by FracTracker.

Brett Cavanaugh, the Director of the Weld County Oil and Gas Energy Department, said he is working closely with ECMC to help operators follow the reporting requirements. Cavanaugh is a county employee.

“ECMC is evaluating next steps to obtain compliance, including potential enforcement action. We are committed to holding any violators accountable,” Cavanaugh wrote in an emailed statement.

The amount of undisclosed chemicals was found by looking at the amount of chemicals reported as trade secrets on FracFocus and comparing those to the chemicals disclosed to ECMC.

The discrepancies between the two added up to 30 million pounds, according to the report.

Gary Allison is the main data analyst behind the report and the founder of OpenFF, an open-source site that takes FracFocus data and makes it more accessible. The environmental groups contracted Allison to analyze the data used in the report.

“In that FracFocus database, we can tell when a well has been fractured and the chemicals that have been added to it based on the FracFocus data. And then we can use that to see if it's actually also been disclosed in the ECMC database.” Allison said.

By comparing the two databases, he found that a little under 40% of the wells had been disclosed by their legal deadline. Allison added that the 30 million undisclosed chemical estimate isn’t even the whole picture.

Allison said the law requires companies to disclose chemicals used in both the fracking and earlier in the process during drilling. But the drilling information is not yet available.

“There's no record of the drilling chemicals in Colorado’s data yet,” Allison said. “The amount of undisclosed chemicals is way higher than we put in the report.”

ECMC can issue fines up to $15,000 a day for not complying with the 2022 law. At the lowest fine of $200 per day, over $37 million in penalties could be levied against Colorado oil and gas operators, according to the report.

“There's a fiscal impact, there's a fairness aspect,” Froelich said. “If the companies that are not in compliance, which the report mentions are big operators in Colorado, that's not fair that they can not comply and not be fined and not be held accountable.”

Bhatt, the conservation chair of the Colorado Sierra Club, told CPR News that it’s “too early to know” if there will be a lawsuit filed for the missing information.

“We are hoping that publicizing this and exhorting the state agencies that oversee these things to do the right thing and to protect the people in the environment,” Bhatt said",Report estimates 60 percent of chemicals remain undeclared.

As a result, the analysis estimates operators have injected 30 million pounds of unknown chemicals into the ground throughout Colorado in the past 21 months. According to the report, Chevron and its subsidiaries make up over half of the undisclosed wells.

Physicians for Social Responsibility published the report on May 20 along with Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado, FracTracker Alliance and the Colorado Sierra Club.

It comes almost three years after Gov. Jared Polis signed HB 22-1348, a first-in-the-nation law that requires oil and gas companies to report chemical compounds used during hydraulic fracturing, a process better known as fracking, and drilling. The law took effect in July 2023.

“Whoever knows the information has to supply the information fundamentally,” Ramesh Bhatt, the conservation chair of the Colorado Sierra Club, told CPR News. “The result of this lack of compliance with the 2022 law now is that we know nothing about 30 million pounds of chemicals that have been used.”

The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission is responsible for holding companies accountable for compliance. A spokesperson for the commission said no punishment has been levied on those companies who have not filed.

In a written statement, the commission said, “The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission (ECMC) takes enforcement seriously and has been working with operators to ensure compliance with Colorado law, including reporting requirements … We are committed to holding any violators accountable.”

The spokesperson also said, “On May 21 at a public hearing, ECMC Commissioner Mike Cross committed to reviewing and reporting back to the Commission about the claims made in the report.”

To comply with the law, an oil and gas company uses FracFocus, a nationwide database maintained by state environmental health officials to track chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.

The registry, however, allows companies to decline to identify a specific ingredient if it’s seen as a “trade secret.” The law removed the exemptions in Colorado, requiring oil and gas operators to disclose the chemical information through the Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission. The regulator must then compile and publish the information for a final review on a publicly accessible website.

In a written statement, Patty Erico, a Chevron spokesperson, said the company has disclosed chemicals in compliance with the Colorado law. She acknowledged some of those products used in the fracking process are registered as “trade secrets,” but wrote it’s up to chemical manufacturers, not operators, to register the exact ingredients with state regulators.

Environmentalists and the lawmakers disagree with that interpretation.

Some Details Are Ghastly.,"Sarah covered the Boulder terror attack last night. An Egyptian national, Mohamad Soliman, firebombed a pro-Israel gathering near Pearl Street Mall. We have some new details. Soliman chanted “Free Palestine” during the attack before using a variety of incendiary devices, including a makeshift flamethrower. That weapon was later revealed at an FBI presser, where we learned the bureau is investigating this crime as an act of terrorism. (via NYT):

A man used a “makeshift flamethrower” to attack a group of pro-Israeli demonstrators in downtown Boulder, Colo., on Sunday, the authorities said, sending six people to the hospital with burns and other injuries. Witnesses said the man yelled “Free Palestine” and threw an incendiary device into the crowd, according to Mark Michalek, the F.B.I. special agent in charge. He identified the suspect in custody as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of Colorado Springs. No charges had been filed, officials said. The victims: The victims ranged in age from 67 to 88 and their injuries ranged from serious to minor, the authorities said. Two were airlifted to a burn unit at a hospital in the Denver area, officials said. Calls for help: Calls about an emergency on the Pearl Street pedestrian mall near Boulder’s county courthouse came in starting at 1:26 p.m. local time, Boulder’s police chief, Steve Redfearn, said in a news conference. Initial reports mentioned a man with a weapon and said people were being set on fire. Chief Redfearn said investigators were not entirely certain of what happened, but the report was “fairly consistent with the injuries that we found on scene.” Suspect arrested: The suspect, Mr. Soliman, was taken into custody after witnesses pointed him out, the chief said. Videos on social media showed a man, shirtless and holding two bottles, shouting while bystanders helped injured people nearby. Patches of grass in front of the courthouse were on fire. A peaceful gathering: The victims were participating in Run for Their Lives, a weekly event that has brought attention to the Israeli hostages being held in Gaza since the Thanksgiving after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel. “Our walk has been nothing ever but peaceful, and this was a blatant act of antisemitism on the streets of Boulder,” said Rachel Amaru, a leader of the group. “Appears to be a hate crime”: The attorney general of Colorado, Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said in a statement that “this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” He added, “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences.”

No, there's no 'appears to be a hate crime' here, Mr. DA. It's an act of antisemitic terrorism. It's a terror attack; there was a flamethrower? It's unreal that some cannot see what's clear as day here.

This is a decent rundown from the Times, though that’s not saying much. CBS and NBC News opted to sanitize their headlines for obvious political reasons. The Times’ headline could’ve been better—'6 People Burned in Attack on Event for Israeli Hostages in Colorado—but at least it didn’t say “Gaza hostage awareness marchers,” which is the word choice NBC News used instead of Jewish people.

Six people were injured in the attack; ages range from 67 to 88. One of the victims who was burned is a Holocaust survivor. Mr. Soliman is in the country illegally. He overstayed his visa.

The media reaction has been as expected:",

Lynn Granger, the President and CEO of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, called the report ""disappointing"" since it equates a noncompliance issue with public health concerns. She said the oil and gas industry has every intention of following state regulations, and it’s struggled with IT issues on chemical disclosure forms.

“We have had a pretty large regulatory overhaul over the last several years on both the energy and management commission,” Granger told CPR News. “Our industry has come to the table and it is an industry that wants to comply with every regulation that we have on the books in the state of Colorado.""

Granger said that the Colorado Oil and Gas Association is meeting with ECMC this week to discuss compliance issues.

Fracking requires pumping liquid into porous rock to break it apart and stimulate the release of trapped oil and gas. Some of that liquid contains chemical additives to more effectively open cracks and stimulate oil and gas production.

According to FracFocus, different chemical compounds are found in different mixes, and “dozens of other fluids” that act as corrosion prevention, lubricant for the well and prevents bacteria growth. Meaning a cocktail of chemicals are used throughout the process.

But, according to Froelich, one of the state representatives who sponsored HB 22 -1348, operators have failed to follow the requirements according to the law, or how the lawmakers were hoping.

“It's commensurately disappointing, frustrating, makes you mad, that it turns out that there just really isn't compliance.” Froelich told CPR News.

She compared the bill to a nutritional label.

“The industry pushed back, saying, ‘Coca-Cola can't be required to disclose its secret formula.’ Yeah, that's true. But what's on the side of a Coke can? All the ingredients in Coke. That's all that our bill says,” Froelich said. “Tell us the chemicals that you're putting down (to) process oil and gas operations in Colorado.”

She says she’s looking to Polis to push for compliance.

“I look forward to the administration adhering to their own environmental goals. I mean, the governor signed this bill, it's in line with what he wants to accomplish in Colorado,” Froelich said. “This is his agency under his purview. So we hope to see compliance.”

The report suggests Chevron and its subsidiaries have the most undisclosed reports. A Chevron well exploded in Weld County earlier this year and an investigation is still underway determining how much crude oil, chemicals and water were released.

The well took nearly five days to fully secure and resulted in a rush of chemicals onto homes, cars, fences and multiple creeks.

Chevron told CPR News that the “vast majority of components in fracturing fluid are also used in well-known everyday products,” and pointed to water, salt and citric acid as examples.

Most of the undisclosed drilling happened in Weld County, according to a map created by FracTracker.

Brett Cavanaugh, the Director of the Weld County Oil and Gas Energy Department, said he is working closely with ECMC to help operators follow the reporting requirements. Cavanaugh is a county employee.

“ECMC is evaluating next steps to obtain compliance, including potential enforcement action. We are committed to holding any violators accountable,” Cavanaugh wrote in an emailed statement.

The amount of undisclosed chemicals was found by looking at the amount of chemicals reported as trade secrets on FracFocus and comparing those to the chemicals disclosed to ECMC.

The discrepancies between the two added up to 30 million pounds, according to the report.

Gary Allison is the main data analyst behind the report and the founder of OpenFF, an open-source site that takes FracFocus data and makes it more accessible. The environmental groups contracted Allison to analyze the data used in the report.

“In that FracFocus database, we can tell when a well has been fractured and the chemicals that have been added to it based on the FracFocus data. And then we can use that to see if it's actually also been disclosed in the ECMC database.” Allison said.

By comparing the two databases, he found that a little under 40% of the wells had been disclosed by their legal deadline. Allison added that the 30 million undisclosed chemical estimate isn’t even the whole picture.

Allison said the law requires companies to disclose chemicals used in both the fracking and earlier in the process during drilling. But the drilling information is not yet available.

“There's no record of the drilling chemicals in Colorado’s data yet,” Allison said. “The amount of undisclosed chemicals is way higher than we put in the report.”

ECMC can issue fines up to $15,000 a day for not complying with the 2022 law. At the lowest fine of $200 per day, over $37 million in penalties could be levied against Colorado oil and gas operators, according to the report.

“There's a fiscal impact, there's a fairness aspect,” Froelich said. “If the companies that are not in compliance, which the report mentions are big operators in Colorado, that's not fair that they can not comply and not be fined and not be held accountable.”

Bhatt, the conservation chair of the Colorado Sierra Club, told CPR News that it’s “too early to know” if there will be a lawsuit filed for the missing information.

“We are hoping that publicizing this and exhorting the state agencies that oversee these things to do the right thing and to protect the people in the environment,” Bhatt said",Report estimates 60 percent of chemicals remain undeclared.

The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman, told investigators ""he researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them,"" the federal court documents said.

Soliman took a concealed carry class to learn how to fire a gun but ""had to use Molotov cocktails (for the attack) after he was denied the purchase of a gun due to him not being a legal citizen,"" state court documents said.

Soliman, who allegedly disguised himself as a gardener during the attack, allegedly told police ""he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,"" documents said. ""SOLIMAN stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again.""

He ""said this had nothing to do with the Jewish community and was specific in the Zionist group supporting the killings of people on his land (Palestine),"" the state documents said.

Soliman, a husband and father of five, allegedly said he had been planning Sunday afternoon's attack for one year but waited until his daughter graduated from high school last Thursday to carry it out, state and federal documents said.

He said no one knew about his plans and he expected to die during the attack, the documents said.

Soliman appeared at his first state court hearing virtually from jail on Monday afternoon, during which the judge kept his bond at $10 million.

He acknowledged that he had received and understood a protection order barring him from contacting the victims.

Soliman is due back in court on Thursday for the filing of state charges.

He said he drove about 100 miles from his Colorado Springs home to Boulder on Sunday and picked up gas at a gas station on the way, the documents said.

Soliman allegedly ""filled 8 glass containers he purchased from Target with gas, he put them in a black storage bin and in order to get as close as possible to the group he dressed himself like a gardener,"" according to state court documents.

He allegedly used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and threw an incendiary device into a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators at a pedestrian mall, according to the FBI. He allegedly yelled ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, the FBI said.

A video posted on social media during the attack showed Soliman holding what appeared to be Molotov cocktails and saying, ""How many children killed"" and ""end Zionist,"" according to the court documents.

Soliman said he ""only threw two at the group because he got scared,"" according to court documents.

Soliman allegedly targeted the Run for Their Lives walk, which aims to raise awareness about the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and calls for their immediate release. Soliman allegedly told investigators he ""specifically targeted"" this group after learning about them in an online search, according to court documents.

Eight people, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were hospitalized Sunday with burns, and two of those victims remain in the hospital on Monday, police said.

Four other people who suffered minor injuries have since come forward, bringing the victim total to 12, officials said Monday.

Sixteen unused Molotov cocktails were within ""arm's reach"" of the suspect when he was arrested, FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek said at a news conference, and he commended the first responders who jumped in to stop the attack.

The unlit Molotov cocktails were ""comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Ball jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles,"" documents said. Police also found a ""backpack weed sprayer, potentially containing a flammable substance. The clear liquid in the glass bottles and weed sprayer were determined to be 87 octane gasoline, which was determined to contain xylene.""

Soliman is in the United States illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security. He entered the U.S. in August 2022 on a B2 visa and he filed for asylum in September 2022, according to Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.

His B2 visa -- which is typically a tourism visa -- expired in February 2023, McLaughlin said.

Soliman was granted a work permit after his B2 visa expired, a senior official told ABC News. That work permit expired on March 28, so he has been in the country illegally since then, the official said.

He was born in Egypt and lived in Kuwait for 17 years, according to the state charging document. He moved to Colorado Springs three years ago.

Soliman has worked as a driver for Uber and his account has since been banned from the platform, the company said.

""We will never tolerate this kind of hatred,"" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement Monday. ""We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.""

President Donald Trump responded to the attack for the first time on Monday, writing on Truth Social that the crimes will be ""prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!"" the president added.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio tweeted Monday, ""In light of yesterday's horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump Administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you.""

Former President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday that he and former first lady Jill Biden are ""praying for the victims of the violent, targeted attack on the Jewish community in Boulder.""

""We must stand united against Antisemitic violence and hate,"" he said.

The attack comes less than two weeks after two Israeli embassy staffers were shot and killed while leaving an event in Washington, D.C.

In a statement, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said, ""Both attacks are the direct result of months of anti-Israel propaganda, moral equivocation, and silence in the face of raging antisemitism.""

A former high-ranking federal law enforcement official and law enforcement expert, Derek Mayer, says recent rhetoric is likely what prompted the Department of Homeland Security to circulate an intelligence bulletin last week warning of attacks on large summer gatherings.

""The world is a very dangerous place, and evil exists. And, unfortunately, it's very hard to stop these lone wolf, if he is a lone wolf attacker, like the individual in Washington, D.C.,"" Mayer said. ""There's been support for Hamas throughout the United States since October of 2023, and yes, I think that support is growing, not only in our country, but throughout the world.""

As a result, the analysis estimates operators have injected 30 million pounds of unknown chemicals into the ground throughout Colorado in the past 21 months. According to the report, Chevron and its subsidiaries make up over half of the undisclosed wells.

Physicians for Social Responsibility published the report on May 20 along with Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado, FracTracker Alliance and the Colorado Sierra Club.

It comes almost three years after Gov. Jared Polis signed HB 22-1348, a first-in-the-nation law that requires oil and gas companies to report chemical compounds used during hydraulic fracturing, a process better known as fracking, and drilling. The law took effect in July 2023.

“Whoever knows the information has to supply the information fundamentally,” Ramesh Bhatt, the conservation chair of the Colorado Sierra Club, told CPR News. “The result of this lack of compliance with the 2022 law now is that we know nothing about 30 million pounds of chemicals that have been used.”

The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission is responsible for holding companies accountable for compliance. A spokesperson for the commission said no punishment has been levied on those companies who have not filed.

In a written statement, the commission said, “The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission (ECMC) takes enforcement seriously and has been working with operators to ensure compliance with Colorado law, including reporting requirements … We are committed to holding any violators accountable.”

The spokesperson also said, “On May 21 at a public hearing, ECMC Commissioner Mike Cross committed to reviewing and reporting back to the Commission about the claims made in the report.”

To comply with the law, an oil and gas company uses FracFocus, a nationwide database maintained by state environmental health officials to track chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.

The registry, however, allows companies to decline to identify a specific ingredient if it’s seen as a “trade secret.” The law removed the exemptions in Colorado, requiring oil and gas operators to disclose the chemical information through the Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission. The regulator must then compile and publish the information for a final review on a publicly accessible website.

In a written statement, Patty Erico, a Chevron spokesperson, said the company has disclosed chemicals in compliance with the Colorado law. She acknowledged some of those products used in the fracking process are registered as “trade secrets,” but wrote it’s up to chemical manufacturers, not operators, to register the exact ingredients with state regulators.

Environmentalists and the lawmakers disagree with that interpretation.

“The oil and gas people are saying, ‘Oh, it's not really us. It's the chemical companies that are supposed to do this compliance.’ And the bill's pretty clear on that,” Meg Froelich, one of the state representatives who sponsored HB 22 -1348, said. “It says both chemical companies and operators, there’s a whole section of the bill on operators.”

Lynn Granger, the President and CEO of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, called the report ""disappointing"" since it equates a noncompliance issue with public health concerns. She said the oil and gas industry has every intention of following state regulations, and it’s struggled with IT issues on chemical disclosure forms.

“We have had a pretty large regulatory overhaul over the last several years on both the energy and management commission,” Granger told CPR News. “Our industry has come to the table and it is an industry that wants to comply with every regulation that we have on the books in the state of Colorado.""

Granger said that the Colorado Oil and Gas Association is meeting with ECMC this week to discuss compliance issues.

Fracking requires pumping liquid into porous rock to break it apart and stimulate the release of trapped oil and gas. Some of that liquid contains chemical additives to more effectively open cracks and stimulate oil and gas production.

According to FracFocus, different chemical compounds are found in different mixes, and “dozens of other fluids” that act as corrosion prevention, lubricant for the well and prevents bacteria growth. Meaning a cocktail of chemicals are used throughout the process.

But, according to Froelich, one of the state representatives who sponsored HB 22 -1348, operators have failed to follow the requirements according to the law, or how the lawmakers were hoping.

“It's commensurately disappointing, frustrating, makes you mad, that it turns out that there just really isn't compliance.” Froelich told CPR News.

She compared the bill to a nutritional label.

“The industry pushed back, saying, ‘Coca-Cola can't be required to disclose its secret formula.’ Yeah, that's true. But what's on the side of a Coke can? All the ingredients in Coke. That's all that our bill says,” Froelich said. “Tell us the chemicals that you're putting down (to) process oil and gas operations in Colorado.”

She says she’s looking to Polis to push for compliance.

“I look forward to the administration adhering to their own environmental goals. I mean, the governor signed this bill, it's in line with what he wants to accomplish in Colorado,” Froelich said. “This is his agency under his purview. So we hope to see compliance.”

The report suggests Chevron and its subsidiaries have the most undisclosed reports. A Chevron well exploded in Weld County earlier this year and an investigation is still underway determining how much crude oil, chemicals and water were released.

The well took nearly five days to fully secure and resulted in a rush of chemicals onto homes, cars, fences and multiple creeks.

Chevron told CPR News that the “vast majority of components in fracturing fluid are also used in well-known everyday products,” and pointed to water, salt and citric acid as examples.

Most of the undisclosed drilling happened in Weld County, according to a map created by FracTracker.

Brett Cavanaugh, the Director of the Weld County Oil and Gas Energy Department, said he is working closely with ECMC to help operators follow the reporting requirements. Cavanaugh is a county employee.

“ECMC is evaluating next steps to obtain compliance, including potential enforcement action. We are committed to holding any violators accountable,” Cavanaugh wrote in an emailed statement.

The amount of undisclosed chemicals was found by looking at the amount of chemicals reported as trade secrets on FracFocus and comparing those to the chemicals disclosed to ECMC.

The discrepancies between the two added up to 30 million pounds, according to the report.

Gary Allison is the main data analyst behind the report and the founder of OpenFF, an open-source site that takes FracFocus data and makes it more accessible. The environmental groups contracted Allison to analyze the data used in the report.

“In that FracFocus database, we can tell when a well has been fractured and the chemicals that have been added to it based on the FracFocus data. And then we can use that to see if it's actually also been disclosed in the ECMC database.” Allison said.

By comparing the two databases, he found that a little under 40% of the wells had been disclosed by their legal deadline. Allison added that the 30 million undisclosed chemical estimate isn’t even the whole picture.

Allison said the law requires companies to disclose chemicals used in both the fracking and earlier in the process during drilling. But the drilling information is not yet available.

“There's no record of the drilling chemicals in Colorado’s data yet,” Allison said. “The amount of undisclosed chemicals is way higher than we put in the report.”

ECMC can issue fines up to $15,000 a day for not complying with the 2022 law. At the lowest fine of $200 per day, over $37 million in penalties could be levied against Colorado oil and gas operators, according to the report.

The attack occurred hours before the holiday of Shavuot, one of the most sacred times on the Jewish calendar.

The Jewish community of Boulder, Colorado is reeling after a man allegedly shouting “Free Palestine” attacked a hostage rally with a ""makeshift flame thrower"", leaving eight injured.

Four women and four men aged between 52 and 88 years old were taken to nearby hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six.

Steven Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, told reporters hours earlier that it would be “irresponsible” to speculate on motive, though he said he was aware that the FBI was probing an alleged hate crime.

He told reporters that a pro-Israel gathering was taking place in the area, something he said occurs frequently. He added that “multiple” people were injured, with conditions ranging from “minor” to “very serious,” and that the injuries were consistent with individuals being set on fire.

“Today, in Boulder, Colo., Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages,” Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, told JNS. “In response, the Jewish protesters were brutally attacked, with an attacker throwing Molotov cocktails at them.

“It is time for concrete action to be taken against the instigators wherever they may be.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, wrote on an official social media account that he was monitoring the situation.

On a personal account, he wrote that “as the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, DC, it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less.

“Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,” he stated. “I condemn this vicious act of terrorism and pray for the recovery of the victims.”

Leo Terrell, the head of the federal Task Force to Combat Antisemitism and a Department of Justice adviser, stated that ""this was not an isolated incident. This antisemitic terrorist attack is part of a horrific and escalating wave of violence targeting Jews and their supporters simply for being Jewish or standing up for Jewish lives.

""This latest antisemitic terrorist attack happened on the eve of a Jewish holiday, Shavuot, making it all the more chilling and cruel,"" he said. ""This cannot continue. This must not be normalized.""

Eric Fingerhut, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America, stated that ""the attack in Boulder is another example of a wave of domestic terror aimed at the Jewish community,"" a wave that ""must be the highest priority for the Trump administration and Congress.""

Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said that ""the firebombing of a peaceful march in Boulder, Colorado — organized to demand the release of hostages held by Hamas — is horrifying, but it should not come as a surprise.

""Since Oct. 7, we have been warning that antisemitism is not isolated to the margins. Supporters of Hamas are now emboldened and threatening towns and cities across America and the democratic world,"" Lauder said. ""This attack, like the murders outside the Jewish museum in Washington, is part of a broader wave of hate that is being tolerated far too easily — from college campuses to government halls.

""It is not just the Jewish community that suffers. This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies,"" Lauder added.

The Anti-Defamation League said that it is ""closely monitoring"" reports of a ""violent antisemitic attack during today's Run for Their Lives event in Boulder, Colo.,"" which ""occurred at a weekly gathering where Jewish community members run and walk in solidarity with the hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7.""

The ADL Centre on Extremism reviewed video footage of the suspect and believes he can be heard saying, ""How many children have you killed,"" ""We have to end Zionists"" and ""They are killers,"" while gesturing ""toward what appears to be the victims of the attack.""

Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO and national director of the ADL, said that ""this is the second violent attack on the U.S. Jewish community in two weeks.

""First, a young couple slaughtered in Washington, D.C. Now, a firebomb thrown at a group in Boulder, Colo., as they gathered to express solidarity with the 58 hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists,"" he stated. ""Two peaceful Jewish events that ended with rage-filled, violent attacks.""

Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said that “600-plus days of ‘pro-Palestinian’ protests in the U.S. have morphed into violent, antisemitic, pro-Hamas terrorism.

“On May 21, a young Jewish woman and her Israeli embassy boyfriend gunned down in D.C.,” he wrote. “Now American Jews targeted in Boulder. The FBI, and the Trump administration, know this foreign-fueled domestic terror must be stopped before more Americans are murdered.”

Ariella Rada, spokeswoman for Israel's Consulate General in New York, told JNS on Sunday that attacks against Jews are fueled by falsehoods reported in the media.

“We were deeply disturbed to see mainstream U.S. media outlets take Hamas at its word and immediately run with the false allegations released by their ‘Gaza Health Ministry,’ without taking the time to investigate what actually occurred,” Rada said, referring to allegations that Israeli soldiers fired upon people seeking aid supplies in Gaza.

""Footage released by the IDF shows that it is Hamas that is responsible for these deaths,” she said. “Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that starves and intentionally puts its own civilians in danger in order to maintain power. It is doing everything in its power to disrupt the distribution of aid by Israel—in cooperation with American and international partners—to residents in Gaza.”

Rada told JNS that “it is critically important, especially at a time when Jews worldwide are being targeted, that the media take the time to report accurately and not simply echo the lies of Israel’s enemies.

""Israel is fighting a war that was forced upon it that was started on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas invaded Israel, killed over 1,200 people and dragged over 250 people back to its tunnels in Gaza,"" she said. ""Sadly, we have seen the lies of ‘genocide’ in Gaza inspire people to take violent action, most recently Washington, D.C., and today in Boulder, Colo., where there is another unfolding tragedy.""",Suspect in custody after ‘terror’ attack on a peaceful rally in Colorado

Eight people were injured in the attack with what was described as a Molotov cocktail ""makeshift flamethrower"" device. According to the Associated Press, a man yelled “Free Palestine” and hurled the incendiary device at a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives who were concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza.

The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

""My heart breaks for the victims of the terror attack in Colorado today — a horrific act of violence against the Jewish community in Boulder on the eve of the holy holiday of Shavuot,"" Sen.

The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman. NBC News reports he is originally from Egypt and was identified as an Egyptian national; White House official Stephen Miller said he was in the country after he ""illegally overstayed"" a tourist visa granted sometime during the Biden administration.

Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr called the attack a ""clear act of Domestic Terrorism against the Jewish community that demands swift and unequivocal condemnation"" and a ""direct assault on free speech, religious freedom, and the right to assemble, which are foundations of our democracy.""

Lt. Gov. Burt Jones said the events in Colorado were ""heartbreaking and devastating"" and added, ""The Jewish community, and our brothers and sisters in Israel continue to face acts of violence and we will not stand idly by.""

Georgia state senator and 2026 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jason Esteves said he and his wife were ""praying for the victims, and we continue to stand against hate and terror in this country.""

Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns additionally said he was ""devastated"" by the attack and wrote, ""Once again, the Jewish community in our nation has faced a targeted and premeditated act of violence—undermining our most sacred and fundamental rights as Americans."" Georgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon said he was ""horrified to learn of the terrorist attack on members of the Jewish community in Boulder, Colorado who were walking to raise awareness of the hostages still being held by Hamas in the wake of the October 7 attack on Israel.""

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed over 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

Authorities did not disclose details about Soliman but said they believe that he acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but authorities didn’t elaborate on the nature of his injuries.","The attack occurred in Colorado on Sunday, injuring eight people at a demonstration supporting Israeli hostages."

""Since Oct. 7, we have been warning that antisemitism is not isolated to the margins. Supporters of Hamas are now emboldened and threatening towns and cities across America and the democratic world,"" Lauder said. ""This attack, like the murders outside the Jewish museum in Washington, is part of a broader wave of hate that is being tolerated far too easily — from college campuses to government halls.

""It is not just the Jewish community that suffers. This violence tears at the very fabric of our societies,"" Lauder added.

The Anti-Defamation League said that it is ""closely monitoring"" reports of a ""violent antisemitic attack during today's Run for Their Lives event in Boulder, Colo.,"" which ""occurred at a weekly gathering where Jewish community members run and walk in solidarity with the hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7.""

The ADL Centre on Extremism reviewed video footage of the suspect and believes he can be heard saying, ""How many children have you killed,"" ""We have to end Zionists"" and ""They are killers,"" while gesturing ""toward what appears to be the victims of the attack.""

Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO and national director of the ADL, said that ""this is the second violent attack on the U.S. Jewish community in two weeks.

""First, a young couple slaughtered in Washington, D.C. Now, a firebomb thrown at a group in Boulder, Colo., as they gathered to express solidarity with the 58 hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists,"" he stated. ""Two peaceful Jewish events that ended with rage-filled, violent attacks.""

Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said that “600-plus days of ‘pro-Palestinian’ protests in the U.S. have morphed into violent, antisemitic, pro-Hamas terrorism.

“On May 21, a young Jewish woman and her Israeli embassy boyfriend gunned down in D.C.,” he wrote. “Now American Jews targeted in Boulder. The FBI, and the Trump administration, know this foreign-fueled domestic terror must be stopped before more Americans are murdered.”

Ariella Rada, spokeswoman for Israel's Consulate General in New York, told JNS on Sunday that attacks against Jews are fueled by falsehoods reported in the media.

“We were deeply disturbed to see mainstream U.S. media outlets take Hamas at its word and immediately run with the false allegations released by their ‘Gaza Health Ministry,’ without taking the time to investigate what actually occurred,” Rada said, referring to allegations that Israeli soldiers fired upon people seeking aid supplies in Gaza.

""Footage released by the IDF shows that it is Hamas that is responsible for these deaths,” she said. “Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that starves and intentionally puts its own civilians in danger in order to maintain power. It is doing everything in its power to disrupt the distribution of aid by Israel—in cooperation with American and international partners—to residents in Gaza.”

Rada told JNS that “it is critically important, especially at a time when Jews worldwide are being targeted, that the media take the time to report accurately and not simply echo the lies of Israel’s enemies.

""Israel is fighting a war that was forced upon it that was started on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas invaded Israel, killed over 1,200 people and dragged over 250 people back to its tunnels in Gaza,"" she said. ""Sadly, we have seen the lies of ‘genocide’ in Gaza inspire people to take violent action, most recently Washington, D.C., and today in Boulder, Colo., where there is another unfolding tragedy.""",Suspect in custody after ‘terror’ attack on a peaceful rally in Colorado

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, an Egyptian national, was charged with a federal hate crime, according to court documents obtained by ABC News on Monday (June 2). Soliman entered the U.S. through Los Angeles International Airport on August 27, 2022, on a non-immigrant visa and was permitted to stay through February 26, 2023. Soliman filed a claim clearing him for work authorization by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on March 29, 2023, which expired in March 2025, meaning he was in the U.S. illegally for more than two months prior to the incident on Sunday (June 1). White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller blamed former President Joe Biden's administration for Soliman being in the U.S. illegally.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien. He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” Miller wrote on his X account. Soliman had previously attempted to enter the U.S. in 2005 but was denied a visa, law enforcement sources confirmed to CNN, though it's unclear whether he tried again between 2005 and 2022. The suspect was seen in a video re-shared by the @StopAntisemites X account mid-tirade calling for the death of ""Zionists"" before tossing molotov cocktails. “They are killers! How many children you killed?” he shouted. “End Zionists!”

Eight people were injured during the ""targeted terror attack,"" according to the FBI via the Associated Press, though authorities didn't elaborate on the injuries. Soliman was seen holding bottles with a clear liquid while waiting for a group outside the Boulder courthouse where a weekly commemoration was being held by Run For Their Lives, an advocacy group supporting the Israeli hostages, 9News reports. The suspect lit the liquid on fire and threw the containers at walkers, striking several people, including one woman who as reported to have been burned and needed to roll on the ground to extinguish the flames, according to Run For Their Lives organizer Miri Kornfeld. Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said the received calls at around 1:26 p.m. local time regarding the incident. “The initial callers indicated that there was a man with a weapon and that people were being set on fire,” Redfearn said during a press conference. “We were on scene very quickly. When we arrived, we encountered multiple victims that were injured with injuries consistent with burns and other injuries.” The suspect was ""pointed out"" by the crowd and detained without incident at the scene before receiving treatment at a hospital for minor injuries. FBI Director Kash Patel initially confirmed that the bureau was investigating the incident as ""a targeted terror attack.""

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available. @FBI,"" Patel wrote on his X account.",The migrant status of the suspect in the firebomb terror attack has been revealed.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is alleged to have shouted “Free Palestine” as he attacked the crowd on Sunday. The FBI said Soliman told police he planned the attack for a year and had specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”, the Associated Press reported.

At a press conference on Monday the Boulder county district attorney said Soliman would be prosecuted for a federal hate crime and 16 counts of attempted murder. If convicted, he would be jailed for the rest of his life, with a cumulative sentence of more than 600 years.

At the press conference, the US attorney for the district of Colorado said in a statement that Soliman had resorted to molotov cocktails when he was unable to obtain a gun. At least 16 unused molotov cocktails were recovered from the scene, according to the US attorney’s office.

An FBI affidavit said Soliman – upon confessing to Sunday’s attack after his arrest – told the police he would do it again.

Officials said there was no indication that the attack was associated with any group. NBC reported Soliman was an Egyptian national, and the White House claimed Soliman was in the US without legal status.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old, including a woman that a Department of Justice official said was a survivor of the Holocaust, were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said, with injuries ranging from minor to “very serious”. Four additional victims had minor injuries but were not hospitalized.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, close to the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, a group which aims to draw attention to the people taken hostage following Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

Soliman is alleged to have thrown a device into a group of people who had assembled in a pedestrianized zone for the peaceful rally. The Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time on Sunday of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old University of Colorado student, told Reuters she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, Coffman said.

She said she saw a man whom she presumed to be the attacker holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

“Everybody is yelling: ‘Get water, get water,’” Coffman said.

Alex Osante, from San Diego, told the Associated Press he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In a video of the scene filmed by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had been burned during the attack.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a molotov cocktail but appeared to accidentally set himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

The justice department said one of the victims was a Holocaust survivor.

“She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,” said Leo Terrell, a senior counsel on civil rights in the justice department. “This is all caused by the same type of hatred: antisemitism.” Terrell, who leads the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce, was criticized in March after he shared a post by a white supremacist.

Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, identified Soliman as the lone suspect.

“It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek told a press conference, citing witnesses.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, described the incident as a “targeted terror attack”, and Colorado’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted”.

Soliman was due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time on Monday, according to Boulder county jail records. He is being held on a $10m bond. Law enforcement officials said Soliman was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

On his Truth Social platform on Monday, Donald Trump said the attack “will not be tolerated in the United States of America”. The US president also said acts of terrorism “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”.

In a post on X, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, described Soliman as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed his tourist visa. Miller criticized Joe Biden’s presidential administration, whom he said had given Soliman a work permit.

CNN, citing law enforcement officials, reported that Soliman arrived in the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor. It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump’s presidency.

Soliman had previously applied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005.

Miller said the attack was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration”.

In his Truth post, Trump linked Soliman’s presence in the US to “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our country so badly”.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman was “illegally in our country”.

“He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin said.

The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Israel’s war on Gaza, which in the US has spurred both an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes.

It follows the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

Conservative supporters of Israel have branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, and Trump’s administration has detained several protesters of the war without charge, while cutting off funding to elite US universities where protests against Israel’s war on Gaza have taken place.

Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. It is still holding 58 hostages in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to be still alive. Israel responded to the attack by launching a bombing campaign on Gaza which has killed more than 54,000 people.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement that the Colorado victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law”.","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who allegedly shouted ‘Free Palestine’ during attack, charged with multiple felonies"

Witnesses reported that the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd. The suspect was also heard to yell “Free Palestine” during the attack, according to police.

After receiving updated information, law enforcement officials have now identified eight victims: Four women and four men ages 52 to 88 were taken to Denver metro hospitals.

The victims were participating in a peaceful demonstration meant to raise awareness of Israeli hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza.

The FBI is investigating the attack as a targeted act of terrorism and is working with the Boulder Police Department to process the crime scene, interview witnesses and gather evidence.

“We stand in full solidarity with those targeted,"" said FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek, ""and we will continue to ensure that justice is pursued swiftly, support is provided to victims and their communities, and preventative action is taken to protect everyone’s safety.

""We stand in full solidarity with those targeted. We will continue to ensure that justice is pursued swiftly, support is provided to victims and their communities, and preventative action is taken to protect everyone’s safety.”

At a news conference, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn cited the quick response of officers in quickly apprehended the suspect.

“When this call came out today, our officers rushed to the scene as quickly as they could to protect our community and arrest the suspect and I’m very proud of their response,"" Redfearn said. ""I also greatly appreciate all of our law enforcement and community partners who responded to help as well.

""I want to assure our Boulder community that we will have increased presence at many events and locations throughout the city to ensure safety.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he is “closely monitoring” the situation, adding that “hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is alleged to have shouted “Free Palestine” as he attacked the crowd on Sunday. The FBI said Soliman told police he planned the attack for a year and had specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”, the Associated Press reported.

At a press conference on Monday the Boulder county district attorney said Soliman would be prosecuted for a federal hate crime and 16 counts of attempted murder. If convicted, he would be jailed for the rest of his life, with a cumulative sentence of more than 600 years.

At the press conference, the US attorney for the district of Colorado said in a statement that Soliman had resorted to molotov cocktails when he was unable to obtain a gun. At least 16 unused molotov cocktails were recovered from the scene, according to the US attorney’s office.

An FBI affidavit said Soliman – upon confessing to Sunday’s attack after his arrest – told the police he would do it again.

Officials said there was no indication that the attack was associated with any group. NBC reported Soliman was an Egyptian national, and the White House claimed Soliman was in the US without legal status.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old, including a woman that a Department of Justice official said was a survivor of the Holocaust, were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said, with injuries ranging from minor to “very serious”. Four additional victims had minor injuries but were not hospitalized.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, close to the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, a group which aims to draw attention to the people taken hostage following Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

Soliman is alleged to have thrown a device into a group of people who had assembled in a pedestrianized zone for the peaceful rally. The Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time on Sunday of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old University of Colorado student, told Reuters she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, Coffman said.

She said she saw a man whom she presumed to be the attacker holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

“Everybody is yelling: ‘Get water, get water,’” Coffman said.

Alex Osante, from San Diego, told the Associated Press he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In a video of the scene filmed by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had been burned during the attack.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a molotov cocktail but appeared to accidentally set himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

The justice department said one of the victims was a Holocaust survivor.

“She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,” said Leo Terrell, a senior counsel on civil rights in the justice department. “This is all caused by the same type of hatred: antisemitism.” Terrell, who leads the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce, was criticized in March after he shared a post by a white supremacist.

Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, identified Soliman as the lone suspect.

“It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek told a press conference, citing witnesses.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, described the incident as a “targeted terror attack”, and Colorado’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted”.

Soliman was due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time on Monday, according to Boulder county jail records. He is being held on a $10m bond. Law enforcement officials said Soliman was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

On his Truth Social platform on Monday, Donald Trump said the attack “will not be tolerated in the United States of America”. The US president also said acts of terrorism “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”.

In a post on X, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, described Soliman as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed his tourist visa. Miller criticized Joe Biden’s presidential administration, whom he said had given Soliman a work permit.

CNN, citing law enforcement officials, reported that Soliman arrived in the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor. It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump’s presidency.

Soliman had previously applied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005.

Miller said the attack was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration”.

In his Truth post, Trump linked Soliman’s presence in the US to “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our country so badly”.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman was “illegally in our country”.

“He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin said.

The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Israel’s war on Gaza, which in the US has spurred both an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes.

It follows the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

Conservative supporters of Israel have branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, and Trump’s administration has detained several protesters of the war without charge, while cutting off funding to elite US universities where protests against Israel’s war on Gaza have taken place.

Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. It is still holding 58 hostages in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to be still alive. Israel responded to the attack by launching a bombing campaign on Gaza which has killed more than 54,000 people.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement that the Colorado victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law”.","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who allegedly shouted ‘Free Palestine’ during attack, charged with multiple felonies"

Could it upend a hostage-taking murder verdict?,"The text message lit up Juror No. 1’s phone after she had gone home on the night of closing arguments in a six-day trial in San Diego federal court. It came from a Colorado area code and a person identifying themselves as “Vanessa.”

After a brief exchange, the juror concluded it was spam and deleted the conversation.

But checking her trial notes during deliberations the next day, Juror No. 1 began to second-guess her conclusion that the messages were junk. A co-defendant and cooperating witness in the brutal hostage-taking murder case that she and her fellow jurors were deciding had been arrested in Colorado, and in trial testimony the jury had learned that another co-defendant and witness was associated with someone named “Vaness.”

Juror No. 1, whose identity the court has kept anonymous along with all other members of the jury in the case, decided to “get a second opinion” from some of her fellow jurors.

Was this a coincidence, or cause for concern that someone connected to the ultra-violent events detailed during trial was trying to contact her?

Last month, U.S. District Judge William Hayes took the rare step of calling the jurors back into court nearly two months after they convicted Brian Alexis Patron Lopez on multiple charges related to the slaying of a San Diego teenager in Tijuana. But this time, rather than listening to testimony about the drug-related slaying, they were placed under oath and asked about the text messages.

Five jurors testified that they knew nothing about the messages. Juror No. 1 and six others who had seen the conversation or heard about the messages mostly testified that they believed the texts were spam, the kind of unsolicited junk texts that millions of Americans receive daily. All testified that the messages didn’t influence the verdict in any way.

Hayes must now decide what effect, if any, the text messages had on the proceedings.

Bringing jurors back to court to question them “is incredibly uncommon,” said Amy Kimpel, an associate law professor at downtown’s California Western School of Law and the executive director of the school’s Innocence and Justice Clinic.

Kimpel, who is not involved in Patron’s case, said federal rules mostly prevent the court from asking juries about their deliberation process, with very few exceptions.

“It’s almost treated as sacred,” Kimpel said of jury deliberations. “We let that situation play out, trust in the mini-democratic process and typically don’t question their decision making.”

Kimpel said one of the few exceptions — laid out in Federal Rules of Evidence 606 — is to question jurors about extraneous information that came to their attention and may have been prejudicial.

Under oath last month, Juror No. 1 testified that she was “wary” about the messages and brought them to a bailiff’s attention after the trial “because it was going to eat at me.” But she testified that the messages did not influence her decision to convict Patron.

Prosecutors argued in a court filing before the jurors testified that the messages were “innocuous,” unrelated to the case and should be ignored. Patron’s defense attorney argued that Juror No. 1 “tainted the entire panel” and that Patron, who faces mandatory life sentences for two of his crimes, deserves a new trial.

“How related the jurors perceived the messages to be — that’s the hard decision Judge Hayes will have to make,” Kimpel said. “His decision will almost certainly be reviewed by (the 9th U.S. Circuit) Court of Appeals.”

The trial in question took place in March and dealt with the abduction, torture and slaying of 19-year-old San Diego resident Miguel Anthony Rendon in May 2020 in Tijuana. Federal prosecutors said that Patron and several co-conspirators were involved in taking Rendon hostage and extorting his family after the teen stole methamphetamine he had agreed to smuggle into the U.S.

Prosecutors asserted that while others were involved to varying degrees, Patron was the gunman who shot Rendon five times in the head, in part to increase his status in a drug-trafficking organization.

Four other defendants previously pleaded guilty to participating in the kidnapping and killing, but Patron was the only defendant to take his case to trial.

During the proceedings, the jury heard testimony that Jonathan Emmanuel Montellano-Mora, one of Patron’s co-defendants, had been arrested by the FBI in Pueblo, Colo. They also heard testimony from another co-defendant about an associate and suspected drug-smuggler named Vaness.

When the trial ended, the jury deliberated for about five hours over a two-day span and convicted Patron of intentional killing while engaged in drug trafficking, hostage taking resulting in death and conspiracy to take hostages resulting in death.

Patron was sent back to custody to await sentencing. Both his defense attorney and the prosecutors left the courtroom.

Most of the jurors also left the courthouse, but when a bailiff went into the jury room to collect the exhibits and their notes, he encountered Juror No. 1, who told him about her concerns regarding the messages from “Vanessa” and the Colorado connection. The bailiff reported this to Hayes, who set a hearing for the next day to inform the attorneys about the messages.

Had the juror reported her concerns during deliberations and before discussing the messages with other jurors, the court could have fairly easily remedied the situation by removing her from the jury and replacing her with an alternate, according to Kimpel.

“But once a verdict is reached, you don’t have the ability to go back,” Kimpel said.

With her client facing mandatory life sentences, defense attorney Meghan Blanco immediately seized on the texts.

“(Juror No. 1) irrevocably tainted the entire panel by commandeering the jury’s focus, from the facts and evidence, to a disquisition about the origin and meaning of the extraneous communique,” Blanco wrote in a post-trial motion.

That alone, Blanco argued in the court filing, was “sufficient to order a new trial,” and at minimum was enough to hold the evidentiary hearings with the jurors.

Hayes agreed and subpoenaed the jurors to testify. During hearings on May 16, May 19 and May 21, they were called in one at a time to answer questions from the judge.

Juror No. 1 testified that she concluded the messages were spam when “Vanessa” claimed that they met at a charity gala. “I don’t go to charity galas,” Juror No. 1 told the judge. But she testified that the messages nagged at her the next day, anyway.

“Is this something to be concerned about?” she recalled asking at least two other jurors.

Those jurors testified that they told Juror No. 1 there was no cause for concern. One testified that he “made (it) clear” to Juror No. 1 that the messages were “purely coincidence” and “absolutely not” connected to the case.

Neither Blanco nor federal prosecutors have filed motions since the jurors testified, though they are expected to do so in the coming months with arguments about whether Patron should be granted a new trial.

Blanco did not respond to messages seeking comment. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to comment.

If Patron seeks a new trial as expected, there is no deadline for Hayes to decide whether to grant it.

Juliette Kayyem, one of the network’s national security analysts, came under fire after challenging FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino when they declared Sunday’s violence at a pro-Israel rally in Boulder a “targeted terror attack.”

“It makes law enforcement look disorganized and it makes the FBI look so juvenile, like why are you getting ahead of the police chief who says ‘I don’t know what this is,'” Kayyem said on air late Sunday in the wake of the incident.

“We’re going to take a step back, not be responsive to tweets by two heads of the FBI who don’t have a long history in law enforcement,” she continued.

“And we will wait and hope it isn’t what we all worry it is — and if it is, then there’ll be an investigation.”



Kayyem, a former Department of Homeland Security official under President Barack Obama and current Harvard professor, added that if the probe found the violence was spurred by terrorism, she’d be the first to say it’s a “hate crime.”

“But until we do, we all need to, to not follow the FBI’s tweets,” she said.

The backlash again Kayyem was swift on social media, with many pointing to footage of the horror that showed the terror suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, screaming “Free Palestine” before he blasted a crowd who were commemorating the Israeli hostages still in Gaza.

“The guy shouted ‘Free Palestine’ while throwing fire bombs at a crowd of Jewish people,” Ben Williamson, an assistant director for the FBI’s public affairs unit, wrote on X.

“We correctly referred to an investigation of terrorism, will continue to do so and we have zero interest in what either these CNN guests have to say. Kick rocks.”

Eight people — four men and four women — were injured, including one woman who was engulfed in flames. The FBI has described it as a ""targeted terror attack.""

Authorities say the suspect shouted “free Palestine” as he attacked with what was described as a makeshift flamethrower.

The assailant, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, threw incendiary devices into the crowd gathered on the Pearl Street Mall around 1:26 p.m. Sunday, The New York Times reported.

The victims, aged between 52 and 88, were participating in “Run for Their Lives,” a weekly walk commemorating hostages taken during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel. Witnesses told media that smoke and screams filled the pedestrian corridor as victims dropped to the ground and bystanders tried to extinguish the flames.

Among those injured was an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor who had fled Europe during the Nazi regime, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm of the University of Colorado told CBS Colorado. The four men and four women were hospitalized. One of the injured might not survive.

A video recording, which Storyful said it had verified, captured a shirtless man wielding two bottles, yelling amid chaos as parts of the grass near the Boulder County Courthouse burned.

Police Chief Steve Redfearn confirmed that Soliman was apprehended at the scene after witnesses identified him. He was also hospitalized.

Officials said two victims were airlifted to a Denver burn unit, and at least one was in critical condition.

The suspect allegedly shouted “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” before igniting and throwing the devices, which included Molotov cocktails, according to the New York Post.

The organizer of the event, Miri Kornfeld, was quoted as saying Soliman had been waiting for the group near the courthouse, holding bottles of clear liquid. As participants arrived, he lit and threw the containers, setting five people alight.

FBI Denver Special Agent Mark Michalek told the media the incident is being investigated as an act of terrorism.

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence,” he was quoted as saying.

Michalek added there was no evidence yet connecting Soliman to any organized group.

The Department of Homeland Security is also involved in the investigation.

FBI Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on X that the National Counterterrorism Center is working with agencies on the ground.

The group’s organizers said the event is “not a protest,” but a “peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release,” according to Axios.

The suspect, Soliman, is an Egyptian national who overstayed a tourist visa, according to Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Post said, citing sources. He entered the U.S. through Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with permission to stay until Feb. 26, 2023. He later received work authorization, which expired in March 2025.

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller commented on X, “Immigration security is national security. No more hostile migration. Keep them out and send them back.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser stated that the attack “appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” He added, “Violence is never the answer to settling differences.”

Mayor Aaron Brockett of Boulder called the attack “disgusting and appalling,” adding that the victims were marching “for peace and for hostage return.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis also expressed outrage, calling the act “heinous” and “unacceptable.”

The attack occurred less than two weeks after two Israeli Embassy employees were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., by a man who also shouted “Free, free Palestine.” The victims in that case were Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim.

The Anti-Defamation League, which combats antisemitism, has said it is monitoring the Boulder case and noted its timing — just hours before Shavuot, a Jewish holiday that began at sundown.

In response, the NYPD said it would increase police presence at religious sites throughout New York City.

The Boulder Police Department has asked the public to avoid the downtown area near the courthouse while investigations continue.","A man set fire to a group of people participating in a peaceful walk in Boulder, Colorado, supporting Israeli hostages Eight people four men and four women were injured, including one woman who was "

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is alleged to have shouted “Free Palestine” as he attacked the crowd on Sunday. The FBI said Soliman told police he planned the attack for a year and had specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”, the Associated Press reported.

At a press conference on Monday the Boulder county district attorney said Soliman would be prosecuted for a federal hate crime and 16 counts of attempted murder. If convicted, he would be jailed for the rest of his life, with a cumulative sentence of more than 600 years.

At the press conference, the US attorney for the district of Colorado said in a statement that Soliman had resorted to molotov cocktails when he was unable to obtain a gun. At least 16 unused molotov cocktails were recovered from the scene, according to the US attorney’s office.

An FBI affidavit said Soliman – upon confessing to Sunday’s attack after his arrest – told the police he would do it again.

Officials said there was no indication that the attack was associated with any group. NBC reported Soliman was an Egyptian national, and the White House claimed Soliman was in the US without legal status.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old, including a woman that a Department of Justice official said was a survivor of the Holocaust, were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said, with injuries ranging from minor to “very serious”. Four additional victims had minor injuries but were not hospitalized.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, close to the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, a group which aims to draw attention to the people taken hostage following Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

Soliman is alleged to have thrown a device into a group of people who had assembled in a pedestrianized zone for the peaceful rally. The Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time on Sunday of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old University of Colorado student, told Reuters she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, Coffman said.

She said she saw a man whom she presumed to be the attacker holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

“Everybody is yelling: ‘Get water, get water,’” Coffman said.

Alex Osante, from San Diego, told the Associated Press he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground, a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In a video of the scene filmed by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had been burned during the attack.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a molotov cocktail but appeared to accidentally set himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

The justice department said one of the victims was a Holocaust survivor.

“She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,” said Leo Terrell, a senior counsel on civil rights in the justice department. “This is all caused by the same type of hatred: antisemitism.” Terrell, who leads the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce, was criticized in March after he shared a post by a white supremacist.

Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office, identified Soliman as the lone suspect.

“It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” Michalek told a press conference, citing witnesses.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, described the incident as a “targeted terror attack”, and Colorado’s attorney general, Phil Weiser, said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted”.

Soliman was due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time on Monday, according to Boulder county jail records. He is being held on a $10m bond. Law enforcement officials said Soliman was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated, but did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

On his Truth Social platform on Monday, Donald Trump said the attack “will not be tolerated in the United States of America”. The US president also said acts of terrorism “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law”.

In a post on X, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, described Soliman as an “illegal alien” who had overstayed his tourist visa. Miller criticized Joe Biden’s presidential administration, whom he said had given Soliman a work permit.

CNN, citing law enforcement officials, reported that Soliman arrived in the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor. It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump’s presidency.

Soliman had previously applied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005.

Miller said the attack was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration”.

In his Truth post, Trump linked Soliman’s presence in the US to “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our country so badly”.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman was “illegally in our country”.

“He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin said.

The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Israel’s war on Gaza, which in the US has spurred both an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes.

It follows the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

Conservative supporters of Israel have branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, and Trump’s administration has detained several protesters of the war without charge, while cutting off funding to elite US universities where protests against Israel’s war on Gaza have taken place.

Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. It is still holding 58 hostages in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to be still alive. Israel responded to the attack by launching a bombing campaign on Gaza which has killed more than 54,000 people.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement that the Colorado victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law”.","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who allegedly shouted ‘Free Palestine’ during attack, charged with multiple felonies"

It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump’s presidency.

Soliman had previously applied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005.

Miller said the attack was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration”.

In his Truth post, Trump linked Soliman’s presence in the US to “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our country so badly”.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman was “illegally in our country”.

“He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022,” McLaughlin said.

The attack comes amid heightened tensions over Israel’s war on Gaza, which in the US has spurred both an increase in both antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes.

It follows the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC who had attended an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

Conservative supporters of Israel have branded pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic, and Trump’s administration has detained several protesters of the war without charge, while cutting off funding to elite US universities where protests against Israel’s war on Gaza have taken place.

Hamas launched an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. It is still holding 58 hostages in Gaza, of whom 20 are believed to be still alive. Israel responded to the attack by launching a bombing campaign on Gaza which has killed more than 54,000 people.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement that the Colorado victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law”.","Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who allegedly shouted ‘Free Palestine’ during attack, charged with multiple felonies"

Every time there is an event in the world that goes against the dead legacy media's preferred narrative, we don't just fear how atrocious the coverage will be; we've come to expect it. That's how low the Western media has sunk.

Sadly, yesterday's antisemitic, targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, is no exception.

The media were shown photos and videos of the attack as it happened. They were supplied with eyewitness accounts showing the attacker screaming and threatening people with exclamations like 'End Zionism!' and 'Free Palestine!'

None of it mattered.

Last night, Seth Frantzman, author and correspondent for The Jerusalem Post, posted a devastating thread of the media coverage of Boulder, and all of it is simultaneously jaw-dropping yet entirely unsurprising.

Frantzman opened his thread with a question about some VERY unnecessary quotation marks from CNN:

CNN, the network that can show live images of BLM protesters burning down cities and call that mostly peaceful, somehow cannot bring themselves to use the word peaceful regarding the Boulder rally without qualifying it.

As Frantzman asks, 'Why? Why, CNN?'

Oh, but it gets worse.

Again, Mohamad Soliman was ON VIDEO shouting his antisemitic rhetoric while brandishing Molotov cocktails. CNN reported none of it.

We suppose that's an improvement? Maybe?

But still nothing about the attacker. And the BBC also questions whether the attack was 'targeted,' even though THEIR VERY OWN STORY cites the Colorado Attorney General (not to mention the FBI) saying that it was.

We know why.

This is one post where we disagree with Frantzman. NBC did not 'do better' at all.

This was their initial headline:

If your headline is twisting the English language in more directions than a pretzel, you are not doing journalism. You are doing propaganda.

Also, notice how so many of the mainstream media's headlines use the passive voice. That's not an accident. They didn't write 'attacker injures peaceful demonstrators.' They wrote 'Gaza-hostage-awareness marchers injured.'

At least CBS used the active voice. That's something.

But they can't bring themselves to say who the victims were. They're just 'people.'

Let's see if ABC did any better. (Spoiler alert: They did not.)

NPR was no better. They also hid all of the details in a passive voice headline.

Not to harp on this point too much, but using the active voice is Journalism 101. Especially in headlines. You learn that on your very first day.

Even if the headline writers are interns, where are the editors?

Frantzman returned to the CNN headline later in his thread, asking the obvious question.

It is NOT unfair to latch on to that glaring example of media malpractice, and it is NOT unfair to ask why.

Frantzman offered his own answer to that second question:

As we noted, by the time many of these articles came out, there were photos, there were videos, there were eyewitness accounts, and there were statements from the FBI, the Colorado Attorney General, and even the governor.

We know because many of these articles included references to those accounts and statements, even though many buried them deep in the story.

Frantzman correctly observes that this is systematic. It is also intentional.

And sadly, it is entirely unsurprising from today's media.

It's been this way for a while, but it is becoming so egregious as to be downright offensive.

With each successive news event that contradicts the preferred narrative, all we can count on from the legacy media is that they will lie to everyone. Shamelessly. (Some outlets are STILL pushing the debunked story from the weekend that Israel attacked a Gaza aid distribution center.)

And they have the nerve to wonder why everyone hates them.

Yet, in an amusing display of cognitive dissonance, the legislature tried to sabotage ride-sharing — an essential component of public transit.

Democratic legislators should thank Gov. Jared Polis, the state’s highest-ranking Democrat, for protecting ride-sharing with his veto of House Bill 1291.

Uber and Lyft, the two major ride-share companies, are essential to the goal of expanding use of public trains and busses. That’s because they resolve a problem that has forever obstructed public transit’s wide-scale viability: The “last mile” dilemma.

Busses and trains are great for getting passengers near their final destinations. Key word: “near.” The moment riders de-board, they typically find themselves a mile or more from the place they need to be. Rain, snow and excessive heat or cold exacerbate this problem.

Getting to Union Station by bus or train in Any City, USA, may be glorious, but not so much if the terminus is a mile or more away. The single greatest option for resolving this problem are the modern phone apps that empower transit users to quickly summon a car and driver to get them exactly where they need to go, without the burden of parking a car.

This option is often less expensive and cumbersome than hailing a traditional cab. Even taxi users benefit, because the competition of ride-sharing keeps cab fares in check.

Those who want us to use more public transit should move heaven and earth to ease the way for safe ride-sharing options. Instead, pro-transit Democrats passed HB 1291 to add onerous and costly regulations to ride sharing. Executives at Uber and Lyft threatened to shut down their Colorado operations if the bill became law, claiming the regulatory costs would make their services too expensive for average consumers.

HB 1291, introduced by Rep. Jenny Willford following a 2023 assault during a Lyft ride, aimed to curb driver impersonation and enhance passenger safety through measures like mandatory ride recordings (no option for privacy), frequent driver background checks, and easy lawsuits against drivers and companies.

Polis characterized the bill as “unworkable” in his veto letter, explaining that such heavy-handed rules would harm the public more than protect it. His veto preserves a critical service while his letter directs agencies to pursue targeted safety improvements.

The bill was more superfluous business regulation in the country’s sixth-most regulated state. It was a solution in search of a problem, given that ridesharing is remarkably safe.

A 2016 study by Frank Martin-Buck found that ridesharing reduced alcohol-related fatal crashes by 10-11.4% in cities that allow it. The study estimates ridesharing could save up to 500 lives annually if available everywhere.

Uber’s 2021-2022 safety report notes that 99.9% of its 2.5 million daily U.S. trips occur without incident, with fatal crashes occurring in fewer than 60 of 1.3 billion annual rides. Compared to traditional taxis, which have higher incident rates, rideshares offer robust safety features. Those include GPS tracking, driver ratings, and in-app emergency buttons. Lyft’s partnership with ADT and Uber’s trip-sharing tools further enhance security, making rideshares safer than alternatives.

Like most of Colorado’s gratuitous regulations, those proposed in HB 1291 would have been regressive, disproportionately harming low-income residents, seniors, and those with disabilities who rely on affordable, on-demand rides.

Businesses and consumers in Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, Denver, Grand Junction and other Colorado cities benefit immensely from the flexibility and affordability of ridesharing options. The governor’s veto safeguards this lifeline, ensuring Coloradans can travel safely and affordably while keeping our state open for business.","Colorado’s Democratic majority, controlling all elements of Colorado governance, wants us to ditch our cars and use public transit.

Police said eight people – aged 52 to 88 – were injured in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver.

The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices.

Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group and had what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Police got calls around 13:26 local time (19:26 GMT) about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a news conference.

Officers who responded found multiple people injured, including those with burns.

One of the people hurt in the attack was a Holocaust survivor, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Speaking to the BBC’s US partner CBS News, Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a “very loving person”.

The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks that appears to be related to the conflict in Gaza.

A man who shouted “free Palestine” fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.

After Sunday’s incident, witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a “makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” said Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI’s Denver office.

Redfearn added that those devices included Molotov cocktails, which he said were tossed at the crowd.

He is an Egyptian national, government officials told CBS. In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources told the broadcaster. He had been living in Colorado Springs.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr Soliman had been given a work permit after his visa expired under the previous administration of President Joe Biden. The BBC has not verified this.

Three hospitalized after stabbing at IHOP

Three people began their week recovering from injuries suffered in a stabbing in West Omaha.

Police responded to the IHOP near 125th Avenue and West Center Road just before 5 a.m. Sunday.

According to Omaha Police, two of the victims were found on scene. The third showed up at a local hospital.

None of the injuries suffered are life-threatening, according to OPD.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information regarding the stabbing can contact Omaha Crime Stoppers anonymously at 402-444-7867, via theOmaha Crime Stoppers website, or via theP3 Tips mobile app.

The suspect in a terror attack in Boulder, Colorado could be charged with two counts of murder. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, could also face one count of attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, one count of causing serious injury to an at-risk adult or someone over 70 and one count of using explosives or incendiary devices.

In an late Sunday night update, officials said eight people were injured. They have yet to confirm a death, despite the charges.

Soliman is accused of hurling an incendiary device into a group that had assembled to raise attention for Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Soliman was booked into the Boulder County jail. Online records did not immediately show when he would make a court appearance.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” Netanyahu said.

Next NSP superintendent to be sworn in

Col. Bryan Waugh was set to officially take over as the next Nebraska State Patrol superintendent Monday.

Waugh has most recently served as the police chief in Kearney for six years.

Police said eight people – aged 52 to 88 – were injured in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver.

The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices.

Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group and had what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Police got calls around 13:26 local time (19:26 GMT) about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said at a news conference.

Officers who responded found multiple people injured, including those with burns.

One of the people hurt in the attack was a Holocaust survivor, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Speaking to the BBC’s US partner CBS News, Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a “very loving person”.

The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks that appears to be related to the conflict in Gaza.

A man who shouted “free Palestine” fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.

After Sunday’s incident, witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a “makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” said Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI’s Denver office.

Redfearn added that those devices included Molotov cocktails, which he said were tossed at the crowd.

He is an Egyptian national, government officials told CBS. In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources told the broadcaster. He had been living in Colorado Springs.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr Soliman had been given a work permit after his visa expired under the previous administration of President Joe Biden. The BBC has not verified this.

Yet, in an amusing display of cognitive dissonance, the legislature tried to sabotage ride-sharing — an essential component of public transit.

Democratic legislators should thank Gov. Jared Polis, the state’s highest-ranking Democrat, for protecting ride-sharing with his veto of House Bill 1291.

Uber and Lyft, the two major ride-share companies, are essential to the goal of expanding use of public trains and busses. That’s because they resolve a problem that has forever obstructed public transit’s wide-scale viability: The “last mile” dilemma.

Busses and trains are great for getting passengers near their final destinations. Key word: “near.” The moment riders de-board, they typically find themselves a mile or more from the place they need to be. Rain, snow and excessive heat or cold exacerbate this problem.

Getting to Union Station by bus or train in Any City, USA, may be glorious, but not so much if the terminus is a mile or more away. The single greatest option for resolving this problem are the modern phone apps that empower transit users to quickly summon a car and driver to get them exactly where they need to go, without the burden of parking a car.

This option is often less expensive and cumbersome than hailing a traditional cab. Even taxi users benefit, because the competition of ride-sharing keeps cab fares in check.

Those who want us to use more public transit should move heaven and earth to ease the way for safe ride-sharing options. Instead, pro-transit Democrats passed HB 1291 to add onerous and costly regulations to ride sharing. Executives at Uber and Lyft threatened to shut down their Colorado operations if the bill became law, claiming the regulatory costs would make their services too expensive for average consumers.

HB 1291, introduced by Rep. Jenny Willford following a 2023 assault during a Lyft ride, aimed to curb driver impersonation and enhance passenger safety through measures like mandatory ride recordings (no option for privacy), frequent driver background checks, and easy lawsuits against drivers and companies.

Polis characterized the bill as “unworkable” in his veto letter, explaining that such heavy-handed rules would harm the public more than protect it. His veto preserves a critical service while his letter directs agencies to pursue targeted safety improvements.

The bill was more superfluous business regulation in the country’s sixth-most regulated state. It was a solution in search of a problem, given that ridesharing is remarkably safe.

A 2016 study by Frank Martin-Buck found that ridesharing reduced alcohol-related fatal crashes by 10-11.4% in cities that allow it. The study estimates ridesharing could save up to 500 lives annually if available everywhere.

Uber’s 2021-2022 safety report notes that 99.9% of its 2.5 million daily U.S. trips occur without incident, with fatal crashes occurring in fewer than 60 of 1.3 billion annual rides. Compared to traditional taxis, which have higher incident rates, rideshares offer robust safety features. Those include GPS tracking, driver ratings, and in-app emergency buttons. Lyft’s partnership with ADT and Uber’s trip-sharing tools further enhance security, making rideshares safer than alternatives.

Like most of Colorado’s gratuitous regulations, those proposed in HB 1291 would have been regressive, disproportionately harming low-income residents, seniors, and those with disabilities who rely on affordable, on-demand rides.

Businesses and consumers in Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, Denver, Grand Junction and other Colorado cities benefit immensely from the flexibility and affordability of ridesharing options. The governor’s veto safeguards this lifeline, ensuring Coloradans can travel safely and affordably while keeping our state open for business.","Colorado’s Democratic majority, controlling all elements of Colorado governance, wants us to ditch our cars and use public transit.

A group of cannabis companies looking to overturn the plant’s illicit status at the national level could be on their way to the U.S. Supreme Court. And there is reason for them to be optimistic that at least one justice is willing to take the case.

Last week the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the group, upholding a lower courts rejection of their lawsuit challenging the federal prohibition of cannabis.

Verano Holding Corp., which operates in 14 different states, along with Massachusetts-based companies Canna Provisions, Wiseacre Farms, and cannabis courier Gyasi Sellers sued the government in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on Oct. 26, 2023, arguing that the CSA should no longer apply to cannabis because of the federal government’s growing acceptance of legal state markets over the last decade.

At the same time, the plaintiffs say that the law unfairly limits access to federal grants, banking services, payroll services and investments, as well as from processing credit cards for purchases. Cannabis operators are often required to deal in large sums of cash, which they argue makes them ripe for robbery, potentially creating a public safety risk.

""We thus conclude that the appellants have failed to show that there is no rational basis for

concluding that their activity substantially affects interstate commerce,"" wrote Chief Circuit Judge David Barron in a 22-page opinion released May 27.

The next legal venue for the plaintiffs would be the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS), but only if the court agrees to hear the case. There is no guarantee that SCOTUS will agree to hear a case, but Associate Justice Clarence Thomas has made it clear that he thinks it is time that the highest court in the land reconsiders the legality of cannabis.

Clarence Thomas has questioned prohibition in the past

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Standing Akimbo v. United States in 2021, which involved a medical dispensary in Colorado suing over its inability to write off business expenses on their federal taxes.

In declining to hear the case, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a five-page statement in which he argued that it might be time to revisit Gonzalez v. Raich. In that earlier 2005 case, Justice John Paul Stevens argued in his majority opinion that despite state law, there was still a clear intention from the federal government to prevent the spread of illegal pot across state lines.

Since then more states have legalized medical and adult-use cannabis, and the federal government has taken several active steps to allow state-legal cannabis businesses, such as defunding law enforcement efforts against cannabis.

""The Federal Government’s current approach to marijuana bears little resemblance to the watertight nationwide prohibition that a closely divided Court found necessary to justify the Government’s blanket prohibition in Raich,"" wrote Thompson. “A prohibition on intrastate use or cultivation of marijuana may no longer be necessary or proper to support the Federal Government’s piecemeal approach.”

The first major challenge from the federal government to state-legal medical cannabis took place during the George W. Bush administration, when Bush's Department of Justice began cracking down on medical cannabis in California. Angel Raich and Diane Monson sue the federal government after DEA agents raided their homes and destroyed the cannabis plants they each grew for personal use to treat their respective chronic health problems.

That case, Gonzalez v. Raich, ultimately made it to the Supreme Count, which ruled the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause, which bars the federal government from interfering in interstate commerce, does not apply to state-legal cannabis as long there was still a federal prohibition. Justice John Paul Stevens argued in his majority opinion that despite state law, there was still a clear intention from the federal government to prevent the spread of illegal pot across state lines.

The plaintiffs in the Canna Provisions case argued before the First Circuit that this is no longer the case.

Congress allowed Washington D.C. to legalize medical cannabis in 2010. The following year, then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued what became known as the ""Cole Memo"" which instructed the Department of Justice to prioritize enforcement of the federal prohibition against individuals in compliance with state regulations.

Four years later, Congress enacted the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment which effectively defunded any DOJ action against state-legal cannabis. That amendment has been renewed every year since.

Donald Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, actually rescinded the Cole Memo in 2017, but since then the DOJ has continued to operate as if the memo was still in effect.

Meanwhile, about three-quarters of all states have legalized medical and half have legalized adult-use.

So far, the courts have remained unconvinced that these changes represent a significant sea change in how the federal government treats cannabis, but it is entirely possible that the Supreme Court sees things differently.",The court battle to legalize cannabis could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court after the plaintiffs failed to convince the First Circuit Court of Appeals.

President Donald Trump allegedly plans on developing a database of Americans' private information, according to The New York Times.

On Friday, the Times reported that the White House had contracted Colorado-based data analytics and technology firm Palantir, co-founded by longtime Trump backer Peter Thiel, for assistance in compiling a database of personal information on American citizens.

Citing unnamed government officials and Palantir employees, the newspaper said the company had been in talks with various government agencies regarding the project, including the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Education.

When approached by Newsweek for comment on the report, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said, without explicitly confirming the report: ""President Trump signed an executive order to eliminate information silos and streamline data collection across all agencies to increase government efficiency and save hard-earned taxpayer dollars.""

Newsweek has also reached out to Palantir via email for comment.

Palantir has partnered with the U.S. government in the past, but the reported expansion of its work with the Trump administration has raised concerns that this could be the precursor to surveillance of Americans on a mass scale, and accusations online that the plan mimics the actions of authoritarian states and China's ""Social Credit System.""

What To Know

Palantir has been deepening its partnership with the government in recent years, its software being employed by the U.S. Army and, last year, through a co-partnership with Microsoft delivering its AI-powered data analytics capabilities to the intelligence community. The company saw its government revenue grow 45 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025 for a total of $373 million.

The company's stock price is up over 80 percent since Trump took office in January, and was trading at $131.78 ahead of markets opening on Monday.

As The New York Times reports, the company's software is already being employed within the Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and others. Both Wired and CNN reported previously that Palantir had been enlisted by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to help craft a database of undocumented immigrants and expedite deportations.

The Times found that the company is now speaking with various other agencies, including the SSA and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), with a focus on its Foundry product, a comprehensive data integration and analytics platform. Officials who spoke to the outlet said that the adoption of Foundry across numerous agencies would allow for the administration to seamlessly create a unified database of information across the federal government.

Trump signed an executive order in March calling for the elimination of barriers to intra-agency information sharing—""Information Silos""—which stated that ""removing unnecessary barriers to federal employees accessing government data and promoting inter‑agency data sharing are important steps toward eliminating bureaucratic duplication and inefficiency.""

What People Are Saying

Jason Bassler, co-founder of the government accountability-focused outlet The Free Thought Project, posted to X, formerly Twitter: ""No, this Palantir database isn't like the others. It will combine: Tax filings, Student debt, Social Security, Bank accounts, Medical claims, Immigration status. No previous database system has ever centralized this much personal info across various federal agencies.""

Other X users compared the reported plan to the Chinese Social Credit system, with one writing: ""This database will be WEAPONIZED against us all once the Social Credit system is in place, and you can, and will become a target if you dare to dissent. Just like how China runs their society.""

""Trump just hired Palantir to create a master database to surveil and harass the American people,"" another wrote. This is as dystopian as it gets and must be rejected by all.""

Computer scientist and entrepreneur Paul Graham, following reports that Palantir was assisting the administration in tracking immigrants, wrote that the company was ""building the infrastructure of the police state,"" and ""help[ing] the U.S. government violate citizens' constitutional rights.""

Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Wired in April: ""The ultimate concern is a panopticon of a single federal database with everything that the government knows about every single person in this country. What we are seeing is likely the first step in creating that centralized dossier on everyone in this country.""

Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Sankar, during an earnings call in February, said: ""I think DOGE is going to bring meritocracy and transparency to government, and that's exactly what our commercial business is.

""I think the work that we've done in government, it's deeply operational, it's deeply valuable, and we're pretty excited about exceptional engineers getting in there under the hood and being able to see that for a change,"" he added.

They’ve lost battles with mountain lions and been struck down by a bullet from an unknown shooter.

But one wolf encountered an even more sophisticated hunter: a government agency that specializes in killing hundreds of thousands of wild animals each year, from beavers to Colorado's state bird, to protect livestock and airplane passengers.

But wolf 2505-BC’s story began far from people and livestock around the towering peaks and frozen lakes of central British Columbia.

Just five months ago, wolf 2505-BC roamed a blinding white wilderness near an island of frosted pine trees in British Columbia’s central interior.

The three-year-old rarely saw humans as he hunted moose and elk.

Occasionally he’d follow lonely roads cut through pine forests to logging camps and mines.

In the beginning of his life, wolf 2505-BC was lucky.

Conservationists say he avoided British Columbia’s controversial aerial wolf reduction program in this region.

Sharpshooters have picked off more than 2,000 of his fellow wolves in this region to protect declining caribou herds.

The cull has drawn opposition from conservationists including Ian McAllister, who co-founded the environmental group Pacific Wild in Victoria, Canada.

“They probably have witnessed their fellow pack members, their extended families, being killed by helicopters,” McAllister said of wolf 2505-BC.

McAllister said this wolf also avoided They’re animals the Canadian government captures, fits with tracking collars and releases back to the wild here so those sharpshooters can follow them and wipe out their entire pack.

“Their habitat is being systematically destroyed through oil and gas developments, logging, mining, et cetera. So these wolves are living a really quite traumatized existence,” McAllister said.

A report from the British Columbia's Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources said wolf 2505-BC had specifically been targeted for ""predator reduction"" to support caribou recovery.

But on Jan. 11, wolf 2505-BC's life suddenly changed. He was moving through this vast white wilderness. Then, an unnatural buzz pierced the silence and crunching of snow.

It must have sounded surreal to the wolf in this quiet landscape. That growing buzz. A blue dot growing bigger in the sky.

Eric Odell, the species conservation manager for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, was aboard one of the choppers that day. He was shopping for fifteen wolves to bring back home.

Odell said someone dangling from the front of the chopper fired a net to catch the wolf.

“And then there's another person in there that will come out and actually stop the animal from moving, and using a pole to hold them down,” he said in March as he recounted the capture operation for the Parks and Wildlife Commission.

He had no missing eyes or broken bones. He had at least four sharp teeth. He was sedated and put in a blanket with snow so he wouldn’t overheat. Then he was put into a crate with hay and an ice block. His vast world suddenly reduced to a crate just a few feet long.

This was also the day 2505 BC got his name because of the numbers on his new tracking collar.

Then he was loaded onto a plane.

“It was usually about a 12 hour experience from wheels up in British Columbia to doors open in Colorado. So quite a day for all of these animals,” Odell said.

As his flight neared the Eagle County Airport in Colorado, residents fearful of wolves and potential attacks on livestock tracked the plane and posted updates on social media.

Suddenly, the wolf had an audience and followers.

Eventually 2505 and his fellow wolves were brought to a secret location in Pitkin or Eagle county and released into the darkness. Not everyone was excited to leave. One of the wolves stayed in their open crate for 42 minutes before venturing into this new world.

2505-BC ran through sagebrush and snow illuminated by flashlights. His Canadian companions fanned out across Colorado, but 2505 headed north to Routt or Jackson counties. Within a few weeks he crossed into Wyoming.

The wolf’s motives were the subject of speculation online and will never be known for certain.

But Rob Edward of the Rocky Mountain Wolf Project has a guess.

“That wolf was looking for love. That wolf was looking for somebody to pair up with,” Edward said.

Edward, whose group led to the successful ballot initiative to reintroduce wolves, celebrated 2505’s arrival.

He said the wolf “was probably following some relatively recent scent trails and postmarks left by wolves that have come down from Wyoming into Colorado.”

Maybe love set him off on his initial search, but he needed food.

The wolf kept heading north. He saw something he never saw in Canada’s interior. A flock of sheep.

The sheep are attacked. And federal agents charged with protecting livestock eyed the wolf through a rifle scope.

Wolf 2505-BC was legally shot on March 15 by agents with the U.S Department of Agriculture. He had survived the frozen lakes of British Columbia, the aerial culling operation killing thousands of its kind in Canada and the sudden capture operation that flew him 1,500 miles from home.

But Colorado’s newest wolf was just one of the thousands of animals killed each year by a government agency called Wildlife Services. It’s charged with protecting livestock and property across the nation. But it has stoked controversy.

An NPR investigation last year found Wildlife Services killed approximately 11,000 wild animals on Montana properties where no wildlife was recorded as responsible for killing or injuring any livestock over a recent three year period.

In Colorado alone last year, agents killed just under 10,000 wild animals. Most of the exterminated species aren’t considered invasive.

Wendy Keefover, a wildlife advocate with Humane World for Animals, calls Wildlife Services “the most important wildlife management agency that most people don’t know exist.”

“It's just this constant killing,” she said.

Wendy Keefover said she became a carnivore advocate in the 1980s after hearing about Wildlife Services using helicopters to track and kill coyotes in Arizona.

Wildlife Services kills prairie dogs and beavers. They also regularly kill a small number of Colorado’s state bird, the Lark Bunting. The small black and white sparrow is one of several species Wildlife Services shoots, traps or poisons around Denver International Airport to protect plane engines and passengers from bird strikes.

According to a report obtained by KUNC News, Wildlife Services killed more than 6,000 wild animals around the tarmac last year, the cost of protecting one of the busiest airports in the country.

The statistics are concerning for wildlife advocates.

“We need to come back to a place where we can coexist with wildlife and and just killing them isn't the answer,” Keefover said.

Wildlife Services declined an interview with KUNC and hasn’t responded to a list of questions emailed to a spokesperson on May 13.

Keefover and other conservationists say the agency has evolved in recent years. They point to some positive projects, including work to prevent human conflicts with bears in Colorado.

Wildlife Services also has started a non-lethal initiative in recent years that has put employees on the ground in Colorado and other western states. They install electric fencing and give ranchers specialized guard dogs to deter wolves and other predators from approaching livestock.

Still, the $2.5 million dollars spent on these efforts last year represented less than one percent of the agency’s entire budget.

Carter Niemeyer worked for Wildlife Services for three decades managing wolf trapping operations in Montana. He eventually became a wolf advocate. He said last month the nation still needs Wildlife Services.

“There's probably always going to be a need for Wildlife Services field people dealing with livestock predation,” he said.

Niemeyer says more changes should be made though. He says the agency should stop large scale killings of animals like coyotes and focus more on non-lethal deterrents.

“No dead livestock, no dead wolves,” he said. “We want to keep both alive. That means you got to figure ways to be smarter than letting the wolves and livestock mingle.”

Rob Edward of the Rocky Mountain Wolf Project said last month wolf 2505-BC should still be living.

“It’s an abomination,"" he said of it’s death. “The agency continues to operate from a kill first and ask questions later, paradigm, and that's that's just not acceptable. That's got to change.”

Meanwhile, biologists say Colorado’s wolf restoration effort is still on track despite the string of deaths.

“That said, every single one of those wolves that we've moved from Oregon or from British Columbia are extremely valuable to the program, both genetically and culturally,” Edward said.

Now, biologists say they’re monitoring 2505’s fellow wolves in Colorado for signs of pups.",Nearly a third of the wolves Colorado has reintroduced in the last two years have died. They’ve lost battles with mountain lions and been struck down by a bullet from an unknown shooter.But one wolf encountered an even more sophisticated hunter: a government agency that specializes in killing hundreds of thousands of wild animals each year to protect livestock and airplane passengers.

In Western Colorado, Fort Uncompahgre (Fort Rubidoux) is considered the oldest fort or Anglo settlements on this side of the Rockies.

So, who occupied Fort Uncompahgre, and what was it like to live on the Western Slope 30 years before Colorado was even a territory? Let's start by checking out the replica of the fort rebuilt during the early 1990s in Delta, Colorado.

The location of the original 1828 settlement at Fort Uncompahgre has been lost to time. Nobody knows exactly where Antoine Robidoux built his fur trading post, but we do know it was a mile or two South of the confluence of the Gunnison/Uncompahgre Rivers (known as Confluence Park).

Robidoux built his trading post to protect livestock and secure goods, it was not a military fort. It's location meant constant trading between Ute indians, Mexican soldiers, and travelers using the North branch of the Old Spanish Trail.

The Role of Soldiers at the Fort

When Antoine Robidou built his settlement, the land was part of the country of Mexico. Robodou and his family were from the Santa Fe area. Most of his employees were of Mexican descent and signed one-year contracts. Occasionally, Mexican soldiers would stop at the fort as part of an escort.

Soldiers would keep the fort supplied, they would drill, and stick to military discipline. They grew their own food if they stayed for extended periods of time.

Violence between the Ute Indians and Mexican troops would come to a head in 1844. The site was abandoned following the fighting. Robidou would never return to the area, and neither would Mexican troops following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848.

No Other People Share Their DNA.","Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:
• An analysis of bones from ancient people who once lived in Colombia has discovered DNA that does not directly connect them to any other ancient or modern population in South America.
• It is thought that these people might somehow be related to speakers of Chibchan languages, which are spoken in the area where they once lived.
• More genomic research will be needed to demystify who these unknown people were and whose ancestors they might be.

Around 6,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers who migrated south settled in the Bogotá Altiplano of what is now Colombia, transitioning to an agricultural society over the next 4,000 years. Then they vanished.

Whoever these people were, they disappeared from the genetic record. The team of researchers who discovered them through fragmented DNA in their skeletal remains have not been able to find any ancient relatives or modern descendants. They are strangely not related to Indigenous Columbians, having more of a connection to people who now live on the Isthmus of Panama and speak Chibchan languages. It could be possible that they spread through the region, mixing with local populations for so long that their genes were diluted, but no one can be sure.

Genetics tell the story of how the Americas were populated by the ancestors of modern Indigenous people. Their origins lie in Siberian and East Asian groups who are thought to have first mixed 20,000 years ago, during the Late Paleolithic, later crossing a bridge of ice to North America some 16,000 years ago. It was then that this lineage split into northern Native American and southern Native American lines. While the northern Native American ancestry is mostly made up of populations that stayed in North America, three more lineages branched into southern Native American ancestry, which would reach further south.

“The Isthmo-Colombian area, stretching from the coast of Honduras to the northern Colombian Andes, is critical to understanding the peopling of the Americas,” the researchers said in a study recently published in Science Advances. “Besides being the land bridge between North and South America, it is at the center of the three major cultural regions of Mesoamerica, Amazonia, and the Andes.”

Each southern Native American lineage can be traced back to its earliest ancestors. There is one line descending from the Anzick-1 individual discovered in 1968, when construction workers unearthed the 12,700-year-old skull of a child belonging to the Clovis people, one of the earliest known peoples in the Americas. This young boy is related to modern Indigenous people from North, Central and South America. Another lineage that is found in the Central Andes comes from ancient people living in California’s Channel Islands. Yet another lineage, also descended from the Clovis population, is associated with the oldest Central and South Americans from Belize, Brazil and Chile.

When exactly these populations appeared in Central and South America is still mostly unknown, but they must have arrived by traveling over the land bridge that connects the southernmost part of Central America to the South American subcontinent. There is also a linguistic connection. Speakers of Chibchan languages share some genetic and cultural aspects with the mysterious people who cannot be traced directly to any population.

When and where the ancestral Proto-Chibchan language originated is unclear, but distinct languages are thought to have started evolving from it several thousand years ago, possibly in southern Central America. Chibchan speakers in this region have kept the largest number of these languages alive. While genetic analysis of local Indigenous people has shown that they are related to more ancient speakers of Chibchan languages, some findings suggest that they are not directly descended from the first people to settle in that part of Colombia.

By studying both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and genome-wide data from 21 ancient individuals who lived in this region from 6,000 to 500 years ago, the researchers were able to find out some information about who they were, but not all the answers. More ancient Panamanians were found to be related to modern Chibchan speakers than ancient Colombians. However, Indigenous Chibchan speakers from Central America are the modern population genetically closest to ancient Colombians who lived after 2,000 years ago.

Many groups who were around at the same time and spoke similar languages to the unknown people still need further investigation.

“Ancient genomic data from neighboring areas along the Northern Andes that have not yet been analyzed through ancient genomics,” the researchers said, “such as western Colombia, western Venezuela, and Ecuador, will be pivotal to better define the timing and ancestry sources of human migrations into South America.”","If they have no ancestors or descendants, then who are they?"

It's something that we have to push back, and it's something we have to, require, a mandate that our institutions extricate themselves of antisemitism.""

Fetterman also condemned the Colorado attack, along with the other high-profile attacks against Jewish people in recent weeks, and pointed out that he is at odds with many in his party on the issue.

A man has been suspected of using petrol bombs to set people alight at a march in Boulder, Colorado, to remember hostages taken by Hamas

Pearl Street Mall has emptied out for the evening as locals head home at the end of an upsetting day. Those who remain around the attack site are mainly local television news crews, each setting up for their evening news hit.

Flowers to wish the victims well have been placed along the edge of a now-abandoned security perimeter, as well as a lone Israeli flag and a “peace” petition which calls for “bridging differences through collaboration, empathy and our shared humanity”.

A mourner has scattered petals in each of the burn marks left by the attacker on the grass in front of the court house. A second flower bed lies under the lamppost where one of the demonstrators received emergency treatment from first responders, one of the last remaining reminders of the damage done on Sunday.

Mohamed Soliman told police that he dressed up like a gardener to get as close to the Jewish group as possible, wearing an orange vest and purchasing flowers from Home Deport.

According to witnesses, Soliman was seen to throw an incendiary device, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw a second, taking off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest.

He told investigators he had been planning the attack for a year.

Four police officers stood on the roof of Boulder County Jail to greet those attending the first court appearance of Mohamed Soliman. Ten more stood watch inside.

As the handful of attendees waited for the session to start, the only sound was the clunk of prison doors opening and closing inside the complex. During his four-minute hearing Soliman spoke only once, informing Judge Nancy Salomone that he understood an order.

After a quick discussion of bond conditions with his counsel, Salomone ordered all parties to reconvene on Thursday at 3.30pm for Soliman to be formally charged. The Egyptian national, with bandages wrapped around his head, left the courtroom quickly and quietly.

Judge Nancy Salomone ordered Soliman to return to court on Thursday where he will be formally charged with 16 counts of attempted murder, use of an incendiary device and attempted use of an incendiary device.

An arraignment hearing has begun at a courtroom inside Boulder county jail for the Boulder attack suspect.

Soliman, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, appeared behind a glass barrier. He indicated to the judge that he had seen a protective order banning him from contacting any of the victims.

Two victims remain in hospital as they continue to recover from burn injuries suffered during the firebomb attack, Stephen Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said.

Six others who were taken to hospital on Sunday have since been discharged. The four additional victims who came forward on Monday sustained minor injuries, Redfearn added.

Mark Michalek, the FBI’s top agent in Colorado, told reporters that they had found no evidence to suggest Soliman had been assisted in the attack.

“If we uncover evidence that others knew of this attack or supported the subject in this attack, rest assured that we will aggressively move to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Michalek added.

Soliman planned to die in the attack, police said in an arrest warrant.

Mohamed Soliman “mentioned several times he wanted to be dead” in interviews with police. “He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” according to the warrant.

He told investigators that he only threw two petrol bombs because he “got scared and had never hurt anyone before”.

Michael Dougherty, the Boulder district attorney, said that the suspect was facing 16 charges of attempted murder, two charges of use of an incendiary device and 16 charges of attempted use of an incendiary device.

If convicted, Soliman would face a maximum of more than 600 years in state prison.

Authorities have identified four further victims, bringing the total to 12. More charges were likely in the coming days stemming from the additional victims, he said.

J Bishop Grewell, the acting US attorney for Colorado, confirmed that Soliman had been charged with the commission of a hate crime during a press briefing.

Grewell said the suspect had attempted to purchase a firearm to carry out the attack, but was unable to do so and so resorted to using petrol bombs.

“No one should ever be subjected to violence of any kind, but our laws recognise that such violence is particularly pernicious when someone is targeted because of their race, religion or country of origin,” Grewell said. “He had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again.”

The FBI, Boulder police, the Boulder county district-attorney and the US attorney for Colorado are due to hold a press conference any moment to provide updates on the investigation into the Boulder terror attack.

One of Mohamed Soliman’s daughters recently received an academic scholarship from the local newspaper, the Colorado Springs Gazette.

In a profile, Habiba Soliman said she had been born in Egypt and lived in Kuwait for 14 years before relocating to the US two years ago.

She told the Gazette that her father had undergone a surgery that restored his ability to walk when she was young. She said that she considered the operation nothing short of “magic”, and that it had inspired her to pursue a career in medicine.

According to the FBI, Mohamed Soliman told investigators that he had been “planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack”.

The high school graduation ceremony was held on Thursday.

Mohamed Soliman worked as an Uber driver in Denver since 2023, the company confirmed.

An Uber spokesman said the Boulder terror suspect was initially hired as a food courier in 2023, and passed all of the background check requirements.

He began driving passengers about nine months ago and cleared a second background check, which included showing a social security number and having a clean criminal record and driving history.

Soliman had not received any adverse feedback while driving for Uber but his employment has since been terminated, the spokesman said.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman is due to make his first court appearance at 3.30pm local time (5.30pm ET, 10.30pm UK time) in a courtroom inside Boulder county jail.

Soliman was booked into jail on Sunday night on charges including first-degree murder, attempted murder and using explosives or an incendiary device while committing a felony. The eight victims injured in the attack survived, and prosecutors are expected to finalise the charges in the coming days.

The charges have been made in state court, and the appearance will be livestreamed to the public.

The suspect left messages for his wife and five children on an iPhone that he hid inside their apartment before the Boulder terror attack, according to the FBI.

Jessica Krueger, an FBI special agent, said in a sworn affidavit that Mohamed Soliman, the alleged attacker, also left a journal with notes to his family at their Colorado Springs home.

Soliman’s wife brought the iPhone, which belonged to the suspect and was used by other family members, to the Colorado Springs police station after the attack, Krueger added.

Soliman told investigators in an interview after his arrest that he had planned the attack for more than a year, and would do the same again if given the opportunity, Krueger said.

“A lady was down on the floor over there, she was really injured,” Maria Miranda, 57, said as she returned to the attack site on Monday. She had been enjoying a hot dog and ice cream for lunch on Sunday when she heard shouting and approached the courthouse. “It was really scary. I heard all the screaming,” she said. “He was right there on the grass.”

She also saw some of the victims lying on the ground. “Her face and side had started burning. Somebody stopped it, but her hair was completely burnt,” she said.

“They looked really scared, everybody was in a panic, I was very stressed. The ladies that were over here, they were saying ‘Shoot him, shoot him!’”

Miranda, who has lived in north Boulder for seven years, said she had also only been minutes away from the 2021 King Soopers supermarket mass shooting which killed ten people. “I don’t feel safe here,” she said. “They [the authorities] need to really be here, with the residents, in the areas where there are more people so they can take care of them and their safety.”

Alexsandra Varela, 23, was working the usually quiet Sunday shift at the Art Mart Gifts shop in Boulder, Colorado, when screams pierced the afternoon lull.

In the street outside a topless man was yelling while launching firebombs at a small group walking outside the historic Boulder courthouse, Varela said. “When the bottle touched the floor, it exploded,” she added.

Stunned and terrified, Varela ran to lock the shop doors. Some of the braver witnesses told the attacker to stop, she said. Varela could see the victims lying on the floor by the courthouse, their red, burnt skin exposed.

“They were crying,” she said. “I saw this lady. She was laid on the floor, and I don’t know if she is the victim that was really hurt, but she didn’t move at all, and people were putting water on her.”

Varela said some bystanders attempted to intervene: “A lot of people were screaming ‘call the police’. Some people were trying to stop him. They were shouting ‘you cannot do this here’. He was like, ‘yes we can’.”

Police arrived in about five minutes, Varela said, adding: “This is just a beautiful city. It’s small, we’re very close to nature, that’s why people usually seem to be happy here. So that’s why I never expected to see something like that.”

The US will aggressively deport any visa holders who exhibit “anti-American values”, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said during an interview about the Colorado terror attack.

Leavitt described the alleged attack by Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who officials said had overstayed his tourist visa, as an act of “despicable evil” in an interview with Fox News.

“It is a privilege, not a right, to enter the United States of America, and we are not going to allow people who are pushing anti-American values and especially engaging in acts of violence to remain in our country,” Leavitt said.

“Your visa will be revoked, and you will be deported.”

Pam Bondi, the US attorney-general, has condemned the “vile” attack on a Jewish group who were trying to raise awareness of the plight of hostages in Gaza.

“The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Bondi said in a statement.

“This vile antisemitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC. We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.”

The suspect charged with firebombing a group of Jewish marchers told police that he had planned the attack for more than a year, according to the FBI.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman confessed in an interview with investigators to targeting what he described as a “Zionist group”, according to an affidavit released in support of federal hate crime charges.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the affidavit read in part. Soliman learnt how to make the petrol bombs used in the attack by watching videos on YouTube.

He told investigators that he had waited until after his daughter graduated before carrying out the attack.

The suspect accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to attack a group of marchers in Colorado has been charged with a federal hate crime.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was charged with a “hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin”, according to court documents.

Soliman is due to appear in state court on Monday afternoon where he faces a range of potential charges.

The FBI has conducted a search of a property in Colorado Springs where a terror suspect is believed to have lived with his wife and children.

Agents swarmed an apartment building in the Cimarron Hills neighbourhood in a “court-authorised law enforcement activity” connected to the firebomb attack on a march in solidarity with Israelis held hostage by Hamas in Boulder on Sunday.

Neighbours said they were in shock after Mohamed Sabry Soliman was identified as the suspect who allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to injure eight participants in the march.

A woman told the KKTV news site that her daughter had played with Soliman’s children. “That’s the scary part… these are everyday people,” the woman said.

A small clean-up crew has removed most signs of fire damage from the square in front of Boulder court house this morning, although patches of burnt grass remain.

Roads around the site reopened early on Monday morning, and residents have been leaving flowers at a makeshift memorial. Apart from the heightened police presence, life goes on as usual in the surrounding streets and coffee shops.

Police have confirmed there will be another press conference later today to provide an update on their investigation. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is due to make his first appearance in court this afternoon.

President Trump has blamed Joe Biden’s “ridiculous open-border policy” for the suspected terror attack in Colorado in his first public statement about the incident.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“He came in through Biden’s ridiculous open-border policy, which has hurt our country so badly. He must go out under Trump policy,” he added.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders SECURE, and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the great people of Boulder, Colorado!”

The suspect in the Boulder firebomb attack had worked at the Veros Health medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, according to a report.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman spent about six months working at the independent physicians practice from early last year, sources told CBS News. It is unclear what his role was at the clinic, which is about 50 miles south of Boulder in the Denver suburbs. He had been living in Colorado Springs.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a B-2 tourist visa, and was given a 12-month work authorisation in March 2023.

He overstayed the visa and was in the US illegally, officials said.

The suspect filled a garden sprayer with petrol to fashion a makeshift flamethrower that he used to douse marchers in flames during an attack in Boulder, Colorado, according to police sources.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly used a lighter to ignite the petrol and spray it in the direction of marchers as they gathered to call for the release of hostages held by Hamas, CNN reported.

In addition, police found a total of 18 incendiary devices near to where the suspect was arrested. Only two of them had been thrown at the marchers.

A vest that Soliman had been wearing caught fire, and he also suffered burns to his hands during the attack. He was treated for the burns at a nearby hospital.

An 88-year-old Holocaust survivor was injured along with her daughter in the suspected terror attack in Colorado, according to a community leader.

Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said that the mother had “been through certainly enough trauma”.

Funk told CNN that she had spoken to several victims of the attack, including one who had suffered “horrible burns”.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, has accused American media outlets of “contributing to the antisemitic climate” he suggested had led to this attack.

Huckabee cited coverage of an apparent Israeli attack near an aid distribution site that the Hamas health ministry said killed 31 people in the Gaza Strip over the weekend. The Gaza Humanitarian Fund, which is in charge of aid distribution, and the Israel Defence Forces have denied the reports.

“The only source for these misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated stories came from Hamas sources, which are designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States,” Huckabee said.

None of the eight victims of the attack have died, Boulder police have said.

The police have also released a mugshot of the suspect, Mohamed Soliman, and his date of birth, December 15, 1979. Soliman, who was booked on charges including first-degree murder, is due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time (8.30pm UK time).

The authorities say the charges on Soliman’s charge sheet do not necessarily equate to any that prosecutors may file against him. Michael Dougherty, the Boulder county district attorney, said on Sunday that authorities would decide what charges to file against Soliman in the next few days.

The suspected attacker has been named as Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs, 45. He was allegedly heard shouting “Free Palestine” before throwing “incendiary devices” into the group of mostly elderly marchers on Sunday afternoon, the FBI said.

Soliman is from Egypt, which borders the Israeli-occupied Gaza strip. It is not clear if Soliman is of Palestinian heritage, but thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled to Egypt after the 1948 creation of the Israeli state.

Police have not found any immediate indication that the suspect was operating as part of a terror cell or network, according to Mark Michalek, the FBI’s top agent in Colorado.

“This will be a thorough and complete investigation, and those checks are ongoing,” Michalek told reporters on Sunday night.

The FBI is leading a multi-agency investigation into the firebomb attack that left eight people injured in Boulder on Sunday afternoon.

Victims who were set alight during a firebomb attack on a Jewish community march in Boulder, Colorado, were writhing on the ground as bystanders attempted to douse the flames.

Peter Irish, a street performer, saw the aftermath of the attack that left eight marchers aged between 52 and 88 injured. “It was chaos, people were writhing on the ground,” he told CBS Colorado. “It was traumatic to watch.”

Ed Victor, who was participating in the Run for their Lives event, said that he felt the heat as an incendiary device exploded nearby him as the group was preparing to begin the march.

Another marcher saw flames “as high as a tree”, Victor said.

Victor said he had tried to put the fires out, while another participant with medical experience stepped in to take care of a woman who had been set alight.

Run for their Lives, the group attacked on Sunday, holds weekly walking and running events in cities around the world to call for the release of hostages held by Hamas. The movement was started by a group of Israelis in California after the October 7 atrocities, and local events are independently organised.

Participants walk or run for a kilometre wearing branded red T-shirts and are encouraged to carry national flags of the citizens who are among the hostages still held in Gaza.

“This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release,” the group says on its website. According to Israeli officials, about 58 hostages are still being held in Gaza. Only 21 are believed to be alive.

Jared Polis, the governor of Colorado, said it was “unfathomable” that the Jewish-American community was facing the third terror attack on US soil in as many months.

In April, a suspect fire-bombed the official residence of Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, hours after the governor and his family hosted a Passover meal there. On May 21 Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, two Israeli embassy staffers, were shot dead outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington.

Polis noted the marchers in Boulder were targeted on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,” Polis, a Democrat, wrote on X. “I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.”

A Holocaust survivor is said to be among the eight people injured.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, a director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS the victim was an 88-year-old woman.

Chany Scheiner, a friend of the victim, described her as an “amazing person … She has spoken at our synagogues as well as other synagogues and schools just about her background and the Holocaust and from her own perspective,” Scheiner told the KUSA news station. “Her life wasn’t easy, but she is just a bright light. And anybody who is her friend is a friend for life.”

Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said he was praying for the victims.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” he said in a statement posted to X. “I trust the American authorities will prosecute the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law and will do everything possible to prevent future attacks against innocent civilians.

“The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped.”

A suspect charged with setting people alight at a march for Israeli hostages in Colorado was in the United States illegally, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a B2 visa, which is primarily used by tourists on short stays, Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. The visa expired in February 2023, McLaughlin added. Soliman filed for political asylum in September 2022.

A man has been suspected of using petrol bombs to set people alight at a march in Boulder, Colorado, to remember hostages taken by Hamas

Pearl Street Mall has emptied out for the evening as locals head home at the end of an upsetting day. Those who remain around the attack site are mainly local television news crews, each setting up for their evening news hit.

Flowers to wish the victims well have been placed along the edge of a now-abandoned security perimeter, as well as a lone Israeli flag and a “peace” petition which calls for “bridging differences through collaboration, empathy and our shared humanity”.

A mourner has scattered petals in each of the burn marks left by the attacker on the grass in front of the court house. A second flower bed lies under the lamppost where one of the demonstrators received emergency treatment from first responders, one of the last remaining reminders of the damage done on Sunday.

Mohamed Soliman told police that he dressed up like a gardener to get as close to the Jewish group as possible, wearing an orange vest and purchasing flowers from Home Deport.

According to witnesses, Soliman was seen to throw an incendiary device, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw a second, taking off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest.

He told investigators he had been planning the attack for a year.

Four police officers stood on the roof of Boulder County Jail to greet those attending the first court appearance of Mohamed Soliman. Ten more stood watch inside.

As the handful of attendees waited for the session to start, the only sound was the clunk of prison doors opening and closing inside the complex. During his four-minute hearing Soliman spoke only once, informing Judge Nancy Salomone that he understood an order.

After a quick discussion of bond conditions with his counsel, Salomone ordered all parties to reconvene on Thursday at 3.30pm for Soliman to be formally charged. The Egyptian national, with bandages wrapped around his head, left the courtroom quickly and quietly.

Judge Nancy Salomone ordered Soliman to return to court on Thursday where he will be formally charged with 16 counts of attempted murder, use of an incendiary device and attempted use of an incendiary device.

An arraignment hearing has begun at a courtroom inside Boulder county jail for the Boulder attack suspect.

Soliman, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, appeared behind a glass barrier. He indicated to the judge that he had seen a protective order banning him from contacting any of the victims.

Two victims remain in hospital as they continue to recover from burn injuries suffered during the firebomb attack, Stephen Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said.

Six others who were taken to hospital on Sunday have since been discharged. The four additional victims who came forward on Monday sustained minor injuries, Redfearn added.

Mark Michalek, the FBI’s top agent in Colorado, told reporters that they had found no evidence to suggest Soliman had been assisted in the attack.

“If we uncover evidence that others knew of this attack or supported the subject in this attack, rest assured that we will aggressively move to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Michalek added.

Soliman planned to die in the attack, police said in an arrest warrant.

Mohamed Soliman “mentioned several times he wanted to be dead” in interviews with police. “He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” according to the warrant.

He told investigators that he only threw two petrol bombs because he “got scared and had never hurt anyone before”.

Michael Dougherty, the Boulder district attorney, said that the suspect was facing 16 charges of attempted murder, two charges of use of an incendiary device and 16 charges of attempted use of an incendiary device.

If convicted, Soliman would face a maximum of more than 600 years in state prison.

Authorities have identified four further victims, bringing the total to 12. More charges were likely in the coming days stemming from the additional victims, he said.

J Bishop Grewell, the acting US attorney for Colorado, confirmed that Soliman had been charged with the commission of a hate crime during a press briefing.

Grewell said the suspect had attempted to purchase a firearm to carry out the attack, but was unable to do so and so resorted to using petrol bombs.

“No one should ever be subjected to violence of any kind, but our laws recognise that such violence is particularly pernicious when someone is targeted because of their race, religion or country of origin,” Grewell said. “He had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again.”

The FBI, Boulder police, the Boulder county district-attorney and the US attorney for Colorado are due to hold a press conference any moment to provide updates on the investigation into the Boulder terror attack.

One of Mohamed Soliman’s daughters recently received an academic scholarship from the local newspaper, the Colorado Springs Gazette.

In a profile, Habiba Soliman said she had been born in Egypt and lived in Kuwait for 14 years before relocating to the US two years ago.

She told the Gazette that her father had undergone a surgery that restored his ability to walk when she was young. She said that she considered the operation nothing short of “magic”, and that it had inspired her to pursue a career in medicine.

According to the FBI, Mohamed Soliman told investigators that he had been “planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack”.

The high school graduation ceremony was held on Thursday.

Mohamed Soliman worked as an Uber driver in Denver since 2023, the company confirmed.

An Uber spokesman said the Boulder terror suspect was initially hired as a food courier in 2023, and passed all of the background check requirements.

He began driving passengers about nine months ago and cleared a second background check, which included showing a social security number and having a clean criminal record and driving history.

Soliman had not received any adverse feedback while driving for Uber but his employment has since been terminated, the spokesman said.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman is due to make his first court appearance at 3.30pm local time (5.30pm ET, 10.30pm UK time) in a courtroom inside Boulder county jail.

Soliman was booked into jail on Sunday night on charges including first-degree murder, attempted murder and using explosives or an incendiary device while committing a felony. The eight victims injured in the attack survived, and prosecutors are expected to finalise the charges in the coming days.

The charges have been made in state court, and the appearance will be livestreamed to the public.

The suspect left messages for his wife and five children on an iPhone that he hid inside their apartment before the Boulder terror attack, according to the FBI.

Jessica Krueger, an FBI special agent, said in a sworn affidavit that Mohamed Soliman, the alleged attacker, also left a journal with notes to his family at their Colorado Springs home.

Soliman’s wife brought the iPhone, which belonged to the suspect and was used by other family members, to the Colorado Springs police station after the attack, Krueger added.

Soliman told investigators in an interview after his arrest that he had planned the attack for more than a year, and would do the same again if given the opportunity, Krueger said.

“A lady was down on the floor over there, she was really injured,” Maria Miranda, 57, said as she returned to the attack site on Monday. She had been enjoying a hot dog and ice cream for lunch on Sunday when she heard shouting and approached the courthouse. “It was really scary. I heard all the screaming,” she said. “He was right there on the grass.”

She also saw some of the victims lying on the ground. “Her face and side had started burning. Somebody stopped it, but her hair was completely burnt,” she said.

“They looked really scared, everybody was in a panic, I was very stressed. The ladies that were over here, they were saying ‘Shoot him, shoot him!’”

Miranda, who has lived in north Boulder for seven years, said she had also only been minutes away from the 2021 King Soopers supermarket mass shooting which killed ten people. “I don’t feel safe here,” she said. “They [the authorities] need to really be here, with the residents, in the areas where there are more people so they can take care of them and their safety.”

Alexsandra Varela, 23, was working the usually quiet Sunday shift at the Art Mart Gifts shop in Boulder, Colorado, when screams pierced the afternoon lull.

In the street outside a topless man was yelling while launching firebombs at a small group walking outside the historic Boulder courthouse, Varela said. “When the bottle touched the floor, it exploded,” she added.

Stunned and terrified, Varela ran to lock the shop doors. Some of the braver witnesses told the attacker to stop, she said. Varela could see the victims lying on the floor by the courthouse, their red, burnt skin exposed.

“They were crying,” she said. “I saw this lady. She was laid on the floor, and I don’t know if she is the victim that was really hurt, but she didn’t move at all, and people were putting water on her.”

Varela said some bystanders attempted to intervene: “A lot of people were screaming ‘call the police’. Some people were trying to stop him. They were shouting ‘you cannot do this here’. He was like, ‘yes we can’.”

Police arrived in about five minutes, Varela said, adding: “This is just a beautiful city. It’s small, we’re very close to nature, that’s why people usually seem to be happy here. So that’s why I never expected to see something like that.”

The US will aggressively deport any visa holders who exhibit “anti-American values”, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said during an interview about the Colorado terror attack.

Leavitt described the alleged attack by Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who officials said had overstayed his tourist visa, as an act of “despicable evil” in an interview with Fox News.

“It is a privilege, not a right, to enter the United States of America, and we are not going to allow people who are pushing anti-American values and especially engaging in acts of violence to remain in our country,” Leavitt said.

“Your visa will be revoked, and you will be deported.”

Pam Bondi, the US attorney-general, has condemned the “vile” attack on a Jewish group who were trying to raise awareness of the plight of hostages in Gaza.

“The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Bondi said in a statement.

“This vile antisemitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC. We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.”

The suspect charged with firebombing a group of Jewish marchers told police that he had planned the attack for more than a year, according to the FBI.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman confessed in an interview with investigators to targeting what he described as a “Zionist group”, according to an affidavit released in support of federal hate crime charges.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the affidavit read in part. Soliman learnt how to make the petrol bombs used in the attack by watching videos on YouTube.

He told investigators that he had waited until after his daughter graduated before carrying out the attack.

The suspect accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to attack a group of marchers in Colorado has been charged with a federal hate crime.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was charged with a “hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin”, according to court documents.

Soliman is due to appear in state court on Monday afternoon where he faces a range of potential charges.

The FBI has conducted a search of a property in Colorado Springs where a terror suspect is believed to have lived with his wife and children.

Agents swarmed an apartment building in the Cimarron Hills neighbourhood in a “court-authorised law enforcement activity” connected to the firebomb attack on a march in solidarity with Israelis held hostage by Hamas in Boulder on Sunday.

Neighbours said they were in shock after Mohamed Sabry Soliman was identified as the suspect who allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to injure eight participants in the march.

A woman told the KKTV news site that her daughter had played with Soliman’s children. “That’s the scary part… these are everyday people,” the woman said.

A small clean-up crew has removed most signs of fire damage from the square in front of Boulder court house this morning, although patches of burnt grass remain.

Roads around the site reopened early on Monday morning, and residents have been leaving flowers at a makeshift memorial. Apart from the heightened police presence, life goes on as usual in the surrounding streets and coffee shops.

Police have confirmed there will be another press conference later today to provide an update on their investigation. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is due to make his first appearance in court this afternoon.

President Trump has blamed Joe Biden’s “ridiculous open-border policy” for the suspected terror attack in Colorado in his first public statement about the incident.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“He came in through Biden’s ridiculous open-border policy, which has hurt our country so badly. He must go out under Trump policy,” he added.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders SECURE, and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the great people of Boulder, Colorado!”

The suspect in the Boulder firebomb attack had worked at the Veros Health medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, according to a report.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman spent about six months working at the independent physicians practice from early last year, sources told CBS News. It is unclear what his role was at the clinic, which is about 50 miles south of Boulder in the Denver suburbs. He had been living in Colorado Springs.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a B-2 tourist visa, and was given a 12-month work authorisation in March 2023.

He overstayed the visa and was in the US illegally, officials said.

The suspect filled a garden sprayer with petrol to fashion a makeshift flamethrower that he used to douse marchers in flames during an attack in Boulder, Colorado, according to police sources.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly used a lighter to ignite the petrol and spray it in the direction of marchers as they gathered to call for the release of hostages held by Hamas, CNN reported.

In addition, police found a total of 18 incendiary devices near to where the suspect was arrested. Only two of them had been thrown at the marchers.

A vest that Soliman had been wearing caught fire, and he also suffered burns to his hands during the attack. He was treated for the burns at a nearby hospital.

An 88-year-old Holocaust survivor was injured along with her daughter in the suspected terror attack in Colorado, according to a community leader.

Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said that the mother had “been through certainly enough trauma”.

Funk told CNN that she had spoken to several victims of the attack, including one who had suffered “horrible burns”.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, has accused American media outlets of “contributing to the antisemitic climate” he suggested had led to this attack.

Huckabee cited coverage of an apparent Israeli attack near an aid distribution site that the Hamas health ministry said killed 31 people in the Gaza Strip over the weekend. The Gaza Humanitarian Fund, which is in charge of aid distribution, and the Israel Defence Forces have denied the reports.

“The only source for these misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated stories came from Hamas sources, which are designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States,” Huckabee said.

None of the eight victims of the attack have died, Boulder police have said.

The police have also released a mugshot of the suspect, Mohamed Soliman, and his date of birth, December 15, 1979. Soliman, who was booked on charges including first-degree murder, is due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time (8.30pm UK time).

The authorities say the charges on Soliman’s charge sheet do not necessarily equate to any that prosecutors may file against him. Michael Dougherty, the Boulder county district attorney, said on Sunday that authorities would decide what charges to file against Soliman in the next few days.

The suspected attacker has been named as Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs, 45. He was allegedly heard shouting “Free Palestine” before throwing “incendiary devices” into the group of mostly elderly marchers on Sunday afternoon, the FBI said.

Soliman is from Egypt, which borders the Israeli-occupied Gaza strip. It is not clear if Soliman is of Palestinian heritage, but thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled to Egypt after the 1948 creation of the Israeli state.

Police have not found any immediate indication that the suspect was operating as part of a terror cell or network, according to Mark Michalek, the FBI’s top agent in Colorado.

“This will be a thorough and complete investigation, and those checks are ongoing,” Michalek told reporters on Sunday night.

The FBI is leading a multi-agency investigation into the firebomb attack that left eight people injured in Boulder on Sunday afternoon.

Victims who were set alight during a firebomb attack on a Jewish community march in Boulder, Colorado, were writhing on the ground as bystanders attempted to douse the flames.

Peter Irish, a street performer, saw the aftermath of the attack that left eight marchers aged between 52 and 88 injured. “It was chaos, people were writhing on the ground,” he told CBS Colorado. “It was traumatic to watch.”

Ed Victor, who was participating in the Run for their Lives event, said that he felt the heat as an incendiary device exploded nearby him as the group was preparing to begin the march.

Another marcher saw flames “as high as a tree”, Victor said.

Victor said he had tried to put the fires out, while another participant with medical experience stepped in to take care of a woman who had been set alight.

Run for their Lives, the group attacked on Sunday, holds weekly walking and running events in cities around the world to call for the release of hostages held by Hamas. The movement was started by a group of Israelis in California after the October 7 atrocities, and local events are independently organised.

“They were crying,” she said. “I saw this lady. She was laid on the floor, and I don’t know if she is the victim that was really hurt, but she didn’t move at all, and people were putting water on her.”

Varela said some bystanders attempted to intervene: “A lot of people were screaming ‘call the police’. Some people were trying to stop him. They were shouting ‘you cannot do this here’. He was like, ‘yes we can’.”

Police arrived in about five minutes, Varela said, adding: “This is just a beautiful city. It’s small, we’re very close to nature, that’s why people usually seem to be happy here. So that’s why I never expected to see something like that.”

The US will aggressively deport any visa holders who exhibit “anti-American values”, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said during an interview about the Colorado terror attack.

Leavitt described the alleged attack by Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who officials said had overstayed his tourist visa, as an act of “despicable evil” in an interview with Fox News.

“It is a privilege, not a right, to enter the United States of America, and we are not going to allow people who are pushing anti-American values and especially engaging in acts of violence to remain in our country,” Leavitt said.

“Your visa will be revoked, and you will be deported.”

Pam Bondi, the US attorney-general, has condemned the “vile” attack on a Jewish group who were trying to raise awareness of the plight of hostages in Gaza.

“The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Bondi said in a statement.

“This vile antisemitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC. We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.”

The suspect charged with firebombing a group of Jewish marchers told police that he had planned the attack for more than a year, according to the FBI.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman confessed in an interview with investigators to targeting what he described as a “Zionist group”, according to an affidavit released in support of federal hate crime charges.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the affidavit read in part. Soliman learnt how to make the petrol bombs used in the attack by watching videos on YouTube.

He told investigators that he had waited until after his daughter graduated before carrying out the attack.

The suspect accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to attack a group of marchers in Colorado has been charged with a federal hate crime.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was charged with a “hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin”, according to court documents.

Soliman is due to appear in state court on Monday afternoon where he faces a range of potential charges.

The FBI has conducted a search of a property in Colorado Springs where a terror suspect is believed to have lived with his wife and children.

Agents swarmed an apartment building in the Cimarron Hills neighbourhood in a “court-authorised law enforcement activity” connected to the firebomb attack on a march in solidarity with Israelis held hostage by Hamas in Boulder on Sunday.

Neighbours said they were in shock after Mohamed Sabry Soliman was identified as the suspect who allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to injure eight participants in the march.

A woman told the KKTV news site that her daughter had played with Soliman’s children. “That’s the scary part… these are everyday people,” the woman said.

A small clean-up crew has removed most signs of fire damage from the square in front of Boulder court house this morning, although patches of burnt grass remain.

Roads around the site reopened early on Monday morning, and residents have been leaving flowers at a makeshift memorial. Apart from the heightened police presence, life goes on as usual in the surrounding streets and coffee shops.

Police have confirmed there will be another press conference later today to provide an update on their investigation. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is due to make his first appearance in court this afternoon.

President Trump has blamed Joe Biden’s “ridiculous open-border policy” for the suspected terror attack in Colorado in his first public statement about the incident.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“He came in through Biden’s ridiculous open-border policy, which has hurt our country so badly. He must go out under Trump policy,” he added.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders SECURE, and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the great people of Boulder, Colorado!”

The suspect in the Boulder firebomb attack had worked at the Veros Health medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, according to a report.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman spent about six months working at the independent physicians practice from early last year, sources told CBS News. It is unclear what his role was at the clinic, which is about 50 miles south of Boulder in the Denver suburbs. He had been living in Colorado Springs.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a B-2 tourist visa, and was given a 12-month work authorisation in March 2023.

He overstayed the visa and was in the US illegally, officials said.

The suspect filled a garden sprayer with petrol to fashion a makeshift flamethrower that he used to douse marchers in flames during an attack in Boulder, Colorado, according to police sources.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly used a lighter to ignite the petrol and spray it in the direction of marchers as they gathered to call for the release of hostages held by Hamas, CNN reported.

In addition, police found a total of 18 incendiary devices near to where the suspect was arrested. Only two of them had been thrown at the marchers.

A vest that Soliman had been wearing caught fire, and he also suffered burns to his hands during the attack. He was treated for the burns at a nearby hospital.

An 88-year-old Holocaust survivor was injured along with her daughter in the suspected terror attack in Colorado, according to a community leader.

Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said that the mother had “been through certainly enough trauma”.

Funk told CNN that she had spoken to several victims of the attack, including one who had suffered “horrible burns”.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, has accused American media outlets of “contributing to the antisemitic climate” he suggested had led to this attack.

Huckabee cited coverage of an apparent Israeli attack near an aid distribution site that the Hamas health ministry said killed 31 people in the Gaza Strip over the weekend. The Gaza Humanitarian Fund, which is in charge of aid distribution, and the Israel Defence Forces have denied the reports.

“The only source for these misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated stories came from Hamas sources, which are designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States,” Huckabee said.

None of the eight victims of the attack have died, Boulder police have said.

The police have also released a mugshot of the suspect, Mohamed Soliman, and his date of birth, December 15, 1979. Soliman, who was booked on charges including first-degree murder, is due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time (8.30pm UK time).

The authorities say the charges on Soliman’s charge sheet do not necessarily equate to any that prosecutors may file against him. Michael Dougherty, the Boulder county district attorney, said on Sunday that authorities would decide what charges to file against Soliman in the next few days.

The suspected attacker has been named as Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs, 45. He was allegedly heard shouting “Free Palestine” before throwing “incendiary devices” into the group of mostly elderly marchers on Sunday afternoon, the FBI said.

Soliman is from Egypt, which borders the Israeli-occupied Gaza strip. It is not clear if Soliman is of Palestinian heritage, but thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled to Egypt after the 1948 creation of the Israeli state.

Police have not found any immediate indication that the suspect was operating as part of a terror cell or network, according to Mark Michalek, the FBI’s top agent in Colorado.

“This will be a thorough and complete investigation, and those checks are ongoing,” Michalek told reporters on Sunday night.

The FBI is leading a multi-agency investigation into the firebomb attack that left eight people injured in Boulder on Sunday afternoon.

Victims who were set alight during a firebomb attack on a Jewish community march in Boulder, Colorado, were writhing on the ground as bystanders attempted to douse the flames.

Peter Irish, a street performer, saw the aftermath of the attack that left eight marchers aged between 52 and 88 injured. “It was chaos, people were writhing on the ground,” he told CBS Colorado. “It was traumatic to watch.”

Ed Victor, who was participating in the Run for their Lives event, said that he felt the heat as an incendiary device exploded nearby him as the group was preparing to begin the march.

Another marcher saw flames “as high as a tree”, Victor said.

Victor said he had tried to put the fires out, while another participant with medical experience stepped in to take care of a woman who had been set alight.

Run for their Lives, the group attacked on Sunday, holds weekly walking and running events in cities around the world to call for the release of hostages held by Hamas. The movement was started by a group of Israelis in California after the October 7 atrocities, and local events are independently organised.

Participants walk or run for a kilometre wearing branded red T-shirts and are encouraged to carry national flags of the citizens who are among the hostages still held in Gaza.

“This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release,” the group says on its website. According to Israeli officials, about 58 hostages are still being held in Gaza. Only 21 are believed to be alive.

Jared Polis, the governor of Colorado, said it was “unfathomable” that the Jewish-American community was facing the third terror attack on US soil in as many months.

In April, a suspect fire-bombed the official residence of Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, hours after the governor and his family hosted a Passover meal there. On May 21 Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, two Israeli embassy staffers, were shot dead outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington.

Polis noted the marchers in Boulder were targeted on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,” Polis, a Democrat, wrote on X. “I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.”

A Holocaust survivor is said to be among the eight people injured.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, a director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS the victim was an 88-year-old woman.

Chany Scheiner, a friend of the victim, described her as an “amazing person … She has spoken at our synagogues as well as other synagogues and schools just about her background and the Holocaust and from her own perspective,” Scheiner told the KUSA news station. “Her life wasn’t easy, but she is just a bright light. And anybody who is her friend is a friend for life.”

Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said he was praying for the victims.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” he said in a statement posted to X. “I trust the American authorities will prosecute the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law and will do everything possible to prevent future attacks against innocent civilians.

“The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped.”

A suspect charged with setting people alight at a march for Israeli hostages in Colorado was in the United States illegally, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a B2 visa, which is primarily used by tourists on short stays, Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. The visa expired in February 2023, McLaughlin added. Soliman filed for political asylum in September 2022.

Several news outlets have reported that Soliman is Egyptian, citing law enforcement sources. He is due to make an initial appearance in court this afternoon.",Mohamed Soliman has been detained after a march to honour Hamas hostages was attacked with petrol bombs; a Holocaust survivor was among the victims

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Mayor Karen Bass is calling for an emergency meeting at City Hall to evaluate security in Los Angeles following what is being described as a ""terror"" attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.

Four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88 were taken to hospitals in Denver for treatment Sunday after a suspect used a homemade flamethrower and molotov cocktails on a crowd walking in a weekly event to call for the return of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas militants during an attack on Israel Oct. 7, 2023.

""What happened in Boulder, Colorado today -- an especially brutal targeting of elders -- is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,"" Bass said. ""This was the second terrorist attack against Jews in two weeks.""

Bass noted that the Los Angeles Police Department is conducting extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers throughout the city. The L.A. County Sheriff's Department is also doing the same, out of an abundance of caution.

""Antisemitism will not be tolerated in this city,"" she said.

The emergency meeting will happen after the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, celebrated from sundown Sunday through sundown Tuesday, to celebrate when Moses and the Israelites were given the Torah at Mount Sinai.

New information has been released about the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, after he appeared in court on Monday.

He's charged with 16 counts of attempted murder and a federal hate crime.

Prosecutors revealed in court papers that he had been planning the attack for more than a year. When Soliman was interviewed, investigators say he told them he had no regrets and would go back and do it all again.

Federal authorities said they haven't ruled out terrorism charges.

Cell phone video captured the chaos and panic after the deliberate attack on peaceful protesters in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday.

""He had three Molotov cocktails, one of them he threw inside a group, and one lady lit on fire from head to toe,"" witness Alex Osante said.

Investigators have identified 12 victims who were burned during the attack.

""Mr. Solimon stated that he had been planning this attack for a year, and he acted because he hated what he called, 'the zionist group,'"" said J. Bishop Grewell, the U.S. attorney for the district of Colorado. ""And when he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die. He had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again.""

The Department of Homeland Security says Egyptian-born Soliman, who lived in Colorado Springs, is in the country illegally after overstaying a work permit.

""He said that he had previously tried to purchase a firearm, but resorted to the Molotov cocktails when he could not purchase a gun because he was not a legal citizen,"" Grewell said.

Solimon is due back in court on Thursday.

Two people are still in the hospital in critical condition.

The attack comes two weeks after two Israeli embassy staffers were shot and killed in D.C., and a month and a half after an arson at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's mansion.","Mayor Karen Bass will call for an emergency meeting at City Hall to evaluate security in Los Angeles following what is being described as a ""terror"" attack on Jewish demonstrators."

A man has been suspected of using petrol bombs to set people alight at a march in Boulder, Colorado, to remember hostages taken by Hamas

Pearl Street Mall has emptied out for the evening as locals head home at the end of an upsetting day. Those who remain around the attack site are mainly local television news crews, each setting up for their evening news hit.

Flowers to wish the victims well have been placed along the edge of a now-abandoned security perimeter, as well as a lone Israeli flag and a “peace” petition which calls for “bridging differences through collaboration, empathy and our shared humanity”.

A mourner has scattered petals in each of the burn marks left by the attacker on the grass in front of the court house. A second flower bed lies under the lamppost where one of the demonstrators received emergency treatment from first responders, one of the last remaining reminders of the damage done on Sunday.

Mohamed Soliman told police that he dressed up like a gardener to get as close to the Jewish group as possible, wearing an orange vest and purchasing flowers from Home Deport.

According to witnesses, Soliman was seen to throw an incendiary device, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw a second, taking off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest.

He told investigators he had been planning the attack for a year.

Four police officers stood on the roof of Boulder County Jail to greet those attending the first court appearance of Mohamed Soliman. Ten more stood watch inside.

As the handful of attendees waited for the session to start, the only sound was the clunk of prison doors opening and closing inside the complex. During his four-minute hearing Soliman spoke only once, informing Judge Nancy Salomone that he understood an order.

After a quick discussion of bond conditions with his counsel, Salomone ordered all parties to reconvene on Thursday at 3.30pm for Soliman to be formally charged. The Egyptian national, with bandages wrapped around his head, left the courtroom quickly and quietly.

Judge Nancy Salomone ordered Soliman to return to court on Thursday where he will be formally charged with 16 counts of attempted murder, use of an incendiary device and attempted use of an incendiary device.

An arraignment hearing has begun at a courtroom inside Boulder county jail for the Boulder attack suspect.

Soliman, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, appeared behind a glass barrier. He indicated to the judge that he had seen a protective order banning him from contacting any of the victims.

Two victims remain in hospital as they continue to recover from burn injuries suffered during the firebomb attack, Stephen Redfearn, the Boulder police chief, said.

Six others who were taken to hospital on Sunday have since been discharged. The four additional victims who came forward on Monday sustained minor injuries, Redfearn added.

Mark Michalek, the FBI’s top agent in Colorado, told reporters that they had found no evidence to suggest Soliman had been assisted in the attack.

“If we uncover evidence that others knew of this attack or supported the subject in this attack, rest assured that we will aggressively move to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Michalek added.

Soliman planned to die in the attack, police said in an arrest warrant.

Mohamed Soliman “mentioned several times he wanted to be dead” in interviews with police. “He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” according to the warrant.

He told investigators that he only threw two petrol bombs because he “got scared and had never hurt anyone before”.

Michael Dougherty, the Boulder district attorney, said that the suspect was facing 16 charges of attempted murder, two charges of use of an incendiary device and 16 charges of attempted use of an incendiary device.

If convicted, Soliman would face a maximum of more than 600 years in state prison.

Authorities have identified four further victims, bringing the total to 12. More charges were likely in the coming days stemming from the additional victims, he said.

J Bishop Grewell, the acting US attorney for Colorado, confirmed that Soliman had been charged with the commission of a hate crime during a press briefing.

Grewell said the suspect had attempted to purchase a firearm to carry out the attack, but was unable to do so and so resorted to using petrol bombs.

“No one should ever be subjected to violence of any kind, but our laws recognise that such violence is particularly pernicious when someone is targeted because of their race, religion or country of origin,” Grewell said. “He had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again.”

The FBI, Boulder police, the Boulder county district-attorney and the US attorney for Colorado are due to hold a press conference any moment to provide updates on the investigation into the Boulder terror attack.

One of Mohamed Soliman’s daughters recently received an academic scholarship from the local newspaper, the Colorado Springs Gazette.

In a profile, Habiba Soliman said she had been born in Egypt and lived in Kuwait for 14 years before relocating to the US two years ago.

She told the Gazette that her father had undergone a surgery that restored his ability to walk when she was young. She said that she considered the operation nothing short of “magic”, and that it had inspired her to pursue a career in medicine.

According to the FBI, Mohamed Soliman told investigators that he had been “planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack”.

The high school graduation ceremony was held on Thursday.

Mohamed Soliman worked as an Uber driver in Denver since 2023, the company confirmed.

An Uber spokesman said the Boulder terror suspect was initially hired as a food courier in 2023, and passed all of the background check requirements.

He began driving passengers about nine months ago and cleared a second background check, which included showing a social security number and having a clean criminal record and driving history.

Soliman had not received any adverse feedback while driving for Uber but his employment has since been terminated, the spokesman said.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman is due to make his first court appearance at 3.30pm local time (5.30pm ET, 10.30pm UK time) in a courtroom inside Boulder county jail.

Soliman was booked into jail on Sunday night on charges including first-degree murder, attempted murder and using explosives or an incendiary device while committing a felony. The eight victims injured in the attack survived, and prosecutors are expected to finalise the charges in the coming days.

The charges have been made in state court, and the appearance will be livestreamed to the public.

The suspect left messages for his wife and five children on an iPhone that he hid inside their apartment before the Boulder terror attack, according to the FBI.

Jessica Krueger, an FBI special agent, said in a sworn affidavit that Mohamed Soliman, the alleged attacker, also left a journal with notes to his family at their Colorado Springs home.

Soliman’s wife brought the iPhone, which belonged to the suspect and was used by other family members, to the Colorado Springs police station after the attack, Krueger added.

Soliman told investigators in an interview after his arrest that he had planned the attack for more than a year, and would do the same again if given the opportunity, Krueger said.

“A lady was down on the floor over there, she was really injured,” Maria Miranda, 57, said as she returned to the attack site on Monday. She had been enjoying a hot dog and ice cream for lunch on Sunday when she heard shouting and approached the courthouse. “It was really scary. I heard all the screaming,” she said. “He was right there on the grass.”

She also saw some of the victims lying on the ground. “Her face and side had started burning. Somebody stopped it, but her hair was completely burnt,” she said.

“They looked really scared, everybody was in a panic, I was very stressed. The ladies that were over here, they were saying ‘Shoot him, shoot him!’”

Miranda, who has lived in north Boulder for seven years, said she had also only been minutes away from the 2021 King Soopers supermarket mass shooting which killed ten people. “I don’t feel safe here,” she said. “They [the authorities] need to really be here, with the residents, in the areas where there are more people so they can take care of them and their safety.”

Alexsandra Varela, 23, was working the usually quiet Sunday shift at the Art Mart Gifts shop in Boulder, Colorado, when screams pierced the afternoon lull.

In the street outside a topless man was yelling while launching firebombs at a small group walking outside the historic Boulder courthouse, Varela said. “When the bottle touched the floor, it exploded,” she added.

Stunned and terrified, Varela ran to lock the shop doors. Some of the braver witnesses told the attacker to stop, she said. Varela could see the victims lying on the floor by the courthouse, their red, burnt skin exposed.

“They were crying,” she said. “I saw this lady. She was laid on the floor, and I don’t know if she is the victim that was really hurt, but she didn’t move at all, and people were putting water on her.”

Varela said some bystanders attempted to intervene: “A lot of people were screaming ‘call the police’. Some people were trying to stop him. They were shouting ‘you cannot do this here’. He was like, ‘yes we can’.”

Police arrived in about five minutes, Varela said, adding: “This is just a beautiful city. It’s small, we’re very close to nature, that’s why people usually seem to be happy here. So that’s why I never expected to see something like that.”

The US will aggressively deport any visa holders who exhibit “anti-American values”, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said during an interview about the Colorado terror attack.

Leavitt described the alleged attack by Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who officials said had overstayed his tourist visa, as an act of “despicable evil” in an interview with Fox News.

“It is a privilege, not a right, to enter the United States of America, and we are not going to allow people who are pushing anti-American values and especially engaging in acts of violence to remain in our country,” Leavitt said.

“Your visa will be revoked, and you will be deported.”

Pam Bondi, the US attorney-general, has condemned the “vile” attack on a Jewish group who were trying to raise awareness of the plight of hostages in Gaza.

“The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” Bondi said in a statement.

“This vile antisemitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC. We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.”

The suspect charged with firebombing a group of Jewish marchers told police that he had planned the attack for more than a year, according to the FBI.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman confessed in an interview with investigators to targeting what he described as a “Zionist group”, according to an affidavit released in support of federal hate crime charges.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the affidavit read in part. Soliman learnt how to make the petrol bombs used in the attack by watching videos on YouTube.

He told investigators that he had waited until after his daughter graduated before carrying out the attack.

The suspect accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to attack a group of marchers in Colorado has been charged with a federal hate crime.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was charged with a “hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin”, according to court documents.

Soliman is due to appear in state court on Monday afternoon where he faces a range of potential charges.

The FBI has conducted a search of a property in Colorado Springs where a terror suspect is believed to have lived with his wife and children.

Agents swarmed an apartment building in the Cimarron Hills neighbourhood in a “court-authorised law enforcement activity” connected to the firebomb attack on a march in solidarity with Israelis held hostage by Hamas in Boulder on Sunday.

Neighbours said they were in shock after Mohamed Sabry Soliman was identified as the suspect who allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices to injure eight participants in the march.

A woman told the KKTV news site that her daughter had played with Soliman’s children. “That’s the scary part… these are everyday people,” the woman said.

A small clean-up crew has removed most signs of fire damage from the square in front of Boulder court house this morning, although patches of burnt grass remain.

Roads around the site reopened early on Monday morning, and residents have been leaving flowers at a makeshift memorial. Apart from the heightened police presence, life goes on as usual in the surrounding streets and coffee shops.

Police have confirmed there will be another press conference later today to provide an update on their investigation. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is due to make his first appearance in court this afternoon.

President Trump has blamed Joe Biden’s “ridiculous open-border policy” for the suspected terror attack in Colorado in his first public statement about the incident.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“He came in through Biden’s ridiculous open-border policy, which has hurt our country so badly. He must go out under Trump policy,” he added.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders SECURE, and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the great people of Boulder, Colorado!”

The suspect in the Boulder firebomb attack had worked at the Veros Health medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, according to a report.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman spent about six months working at the independent physicians practice from early last year, sources told CBS News. It is unclear what his role was at the clinic, which is about 50 miles south of Boulder in the Denver suburbs. He had been living in Colorado Springs.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a B-2 tourist visa, and was given a 12-month work authorisation in March 2023.

He overstayed the visa and was in the US illegally, officials said.

The suspect filled a garden sprayer with petrol to fashion a makeshift flamethrower that he used to douse marchers in flames during an attack in Boulder, Colorado, according to police sources.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly used a lighter to ignite the petrol and spray it in the direction of marchers as they gathered to call for the release of hostages held by Hamas, CNN reported.

In addition, police found a total of 18 incendiary devices near to where the suspect was arrested. Only two of them had been thrown at the marchers.

A vest that Soliman had been wearing caught fire, and he also suffered burns to his hands during the attack. He was treated for the burns at a nearby hospital.

An 88-year-old Holocaust survivor was injured along with her daughter in the suspected terror attack in Colorado, according to a community leader.

Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said that the mother had “been through certainly enough trauma”.

Funk told CNN that she had spoken to several victims of the attack, including one who had suffered “horrible burns”.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, has accused American media outlets of “contributing to the antisemitic climate” he suggested had led to this attack.

Huckabee cited coverage of an apparent Israeli attack near an aid distribution site that the Hamas health ministry said killed 31 people in the Gaza Strip over the weekend. The Gaza Humanitarian Fund, which is in charge of aid distribution, and the Israel Defence Forces have denied the reports.

“The only source for these misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated stories came from Hamas sources, which are designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States,” Huckabee said.

None of the eight victims of the attack have died, Boulder police have said.

The police have also released a mugshot of the suspect, Mohamed Soliman, and his date of birth, December 15, 1979. Soliman, who was booked on charges including first-degree murder, is due to appear in court at 1.30pm local time (8.30pm UK time).

The authorities say the charges on Soliman’s charge sheet do not necessarily equate to any that prosecutors may file against him. Michael Dougherty, the Boulder county district attorney, said on Sunday that authorities would decide what charges to file against Soliman in the next few days.

The suspected attacker has been named as Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs, 45. He was allegedly heard shouting “Free Palestine” before throwing “incendiary devices” into the group of mostly elderly marchers on Sunday afternoon, the FBI said.

Soliman is from Egypt, which borders the Israeli-occupied Gaza strip. It is not clear if Soliman is of Palestinian heritage, but thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled to Egypt after the 1948 creation of the Israeli state.

Police have not found any immediate indication that the suspect was operating as part of a terror cell or network, according to Mark Michalek, the FBI’s top agent in Colorado.

“This will be a thorough and complete investigation, and those checks are ongoing,” Michalek told reporters on Sunday night.

The FBI is leading a multi-agency investigation into the firebomb attack that left eight people injured in Boulder on Sunday afternoon.

Victims who were set alight during a firebomb attack on a Jewish community march in Boulder, Colorado, were writhing on the ground as bystanders attempted to douse the flames.

Peter Irish, a street performer, saw the aftermath of the attack that left eight marchers aged between 52 and 88 injured. “It was chaos, people were writhing on the ground,” he told CBS Colorado. “It was traumatic to watch.”

Ed Victor, who was participating in the Run for their Lives event, said that he felt the heat as an incendiary device exploded nearby him as the group was preparing to begin the march.

Another marcher saw flames “as high as a tree”, Victor said.

Victor said he had tried to put the fires out, while another participant with medical experience stepped in to take care of a woman who had been set alight.

Run for their Lives, the group attacked on Sunday, holds weekly walking and running events in cities around the world to call for the release of hostages held by Hamas. The movement was started by a group of Israelis in California after the October 7 atrocities, and local events are independently organised.

Participants walk or run for a kilometre wearing branded red T-shirts and are encouraged to carry national flags of the citizens who are among the hostages still held in Gaza.

“This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release,” the group says on its website. According to Israeli officials, about 58 hostages are still being held in Gaza. Only 21 are believed to be alive.

Jared Polis, the governor of Colorado, said it was “unfathomable” that the Jewish-American community was facing the third terror attack on US soil in as many months.

In April, a suspect fire-bombed the official residence of Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, hours after the governor and his family hosted a Passover meal there. On May 21 Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, two Israeli embassy staffers, were shot dead outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington.

Polis noted the marchers in Boulder were targeted on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,” Polis, a Democrat, wrote on X. “I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.”

A Holocaust survivor is said to be among the eight people injured.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, a director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS the victim was an 88-year-old woman.

Chany Scheiner, a friend of the victim, described her as an “amazing person … She has spoken at our synagogues as well as other synagogues and schools just about her background and the Holocaust and from her own perspective,” Scheiner told the KUSA news station. “Her life wasn’t easy, but she is just a bright light. And anybody who is her friend is a friend for life.”

Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said he was praying for the victims.

“This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,” he said in a statement posted to X. “I trust the American authorities will prosecute the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law and will do everything possible to prevent future attacks against innocent civilians.

“The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped.”

A suspect charged with setting people alight at a march for Israeli hostages in Colorado was in the United States illegally, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a B2 visa, which is primarily used by tourists on short stays, Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. The visa expired in February 2023, McLaughlin added. Soliman filed for political asylum in September 2022.

Several news outlets have reported that Soliman is Egyptian, citing law enforcement sources. He is due to make an initial appearance in court this afternoon.",Mohamed Soliman has been detained after a march to honour Hamas hostages was attacked with petrol bombs; a Holocaust survivor was among the victims

Here’s what to know about what took place in Boulder:

The FBI and local authorities said on Sunday they are investigating the incident as a terror attack.

“We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available,” FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement posted to the social platform X.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

“I am closely monitoring the situation in Boulder, and my thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” Polis wrote on X.

Authorities identified the suspect arrested on scene as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45.

FBI special agent in charge Mark Michalek said at an evening press conference the suspect used a “makeshift flamethrower” and incendiary devices to attack the victims, as they attended a weekly walk to demonstrate solidarity with the hostages.

The attack took place at a pedestrian mall near 13th and Pearl streets.

Michalek said the suspect “was heard to yell ‘free Palestine,’” during the attack.

Eight people were injured in the attack, according to updated information from local police. Victims include four men and four women, who range in age from 52 to 88.

Initially, police confirmed six victims, ages 67-88, including two victims who had to be airlifted to a burn unit and four taken to a local hospital. One was possibly in critical condition at the time.

White House says suspect in US illegally

The White House said late Sunday that the suspect arrested in connection to the attack is an “illegal alien” who overstayed his visa.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien,” Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser, said in a statement on X.

“He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” he continued.

The local Boulder Jewish community said in a statement that the incident took place during a walk organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization that aims to raise awareness for hostages still held in Gaza.

“We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza,” the statement read. “We don’t have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed.”

“Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured,” read the statement, which was signed by three rabbis of local congregations, two representatives of the Boulder Jewish Community Center, and a representative of the University of Colorado Boulder Hillel.

Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt condemned the recent “rage-filled, violent attacks” at Jewish gatherings and called on public officials to do more before “the crisis escalates even further.”

In a post Sunday on X, Greenblatt connected the Sunday attack in Boulder to the killing of a young couple outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., last month. In both scenarios, the suspected perpetrators were heard to shout “free Palestine” during or after the attack.

“This is the second violent attack on the US Jewish community in two weeks,” Greenblatt wrote in a post on X. “First, a young couple slaughtered in DC. And now, a firebomb thrown at a group in Boulder, Colorado, as they gathered to express solidarity with the 58 hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists.”

“Two peaceful Jewish events that ended with rage-filled, violent attacks,” he added.

Greenblatt also pointed to recent examples of vandalism and violence against Jewish people in places around the world.

“We’re witnessing a global campaign of intimidation and terror deliberately directed against the Jewish people,” Greenblatt said, adding, “Sadly, none of this is surprising. In fact, it’s entirely predictable. This is precisely where anti-Jewish incitement leads. This is exactly what vicious anti-Zionism enables.”

The victims ranged in age from 67 to 88 years old.

One of them, according to a friend who spoke to 9News, survived the Holocaust, an actual genocide where Nazis systematically murdered millions of Jews.

Boulder Terrorist Identified—Reportedly Came to US Under Biden and Lived Here Illegally

To have escaped such a horror only to become a burn victim at the hands of a deranged leftist on the streets of America is horrifying.

""She is an amazing person. Not because she is hurt. She always is an amazing person,"" the friend said in an interview with the outlet.

The Holocaust survivor was known to be active in the community and very passionate about their beliefs, trying to educate people based on their past experiences.

""She speaks -- she has spoken at our synagogues as well as other synagogues and schools just about her background and the Holocaust and from her own perspective. She is passionate about standing up for good things, and she is an extremely exceptional person,"" the friend added.

""Always a smile on her face. Her life wasn’t easy, but she is just a bright light. And anybody who is her friend is a friend for life.""

Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian national, carried out a targeted terror attack against a peaceful rally on behalf of Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza.

He carried out the horrific attack while shouting the leftist rallying cry, ""Free Palestine.""

Soliman, multiple outlets have since reported, has been identified as an illegal immigrant who overstayed his B1/B2 visa after entering the U.S. in August 2022.

He was allowed to remain in the country by the Biden administration, which granted him work authorization in March 2023 despite his expired visa. That permit was only valid until March of this year.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis (D) condemned the attack as an antisemitic act of terror.

""I am closely monitoring the situation in Boulder, and my thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror,"" he wrote. ""Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable. While details emerge, the state works with local and federal law enforcement to support this investigation.""

The founder of Run for Their Lives, Shany Klein, a licensed attorney in California and Israel, thanked law enforcement and fire department officials for “their quick response” and said her “thoughts and prayers were with the victims,” who she hoped would have a “speedy recovery.”

She stressed that Run for Their Lives would continue to be “committed to our mission until all the hostages are returned back home.”

According to the group's LinkedIn page, Run for the Lives was set up in response to the October 7 attack and calls for ""the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas.""

The international advocacy group leads running and walking events to peacefully demand the release of the hostages taken by Hamas in the October 7, 2023, terror attack, according to their website.

“The term 'Run' is symbolic, emphasizing that the hostages cannot run for their lives,” they state. “We run or walk on their behalf, because they can’t—and to act before it’s too late.”

They also emphasize that attendees “Don’t protest” and instead “Focus on humanity,” stressing that their activism is a rallying cry for the “innocent children, women, the elderly, and other civilians being held by terrorists – not about the war.”

Rachel Amaru, an organizer with Run for Their Lives' Boulder chapter, told CBS News the attack was ""blatantly antisemitic.""

Mohamed Soliman, 45, was arrested by police on Sunday. Authorities have not yet announced any charges against him, but the FBI said the attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism. Soliman is a native of Egypt and entered the country on a visa issued during the administration of former President Joe Biden. His documents expired in March 2025, according to Trump administration officials, who told Fox News.

Soliman reportedly yelled, ""End Zionist!"" and “Free Palestine” during the attack, according to two sources and an FBI Denver official to CBS.

Ed Victor, who attended the walk on Sunday, said the organization has been holding silent marches every week since October 7, 2023.

The attack has sent shockwaves through the community, he said. The marchers would occasionally encounter hecklers, but would try not to respond. Others would nod, clap, or thank the participants as they walked by, he added.

“All of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown,” he told CBS. He said he never could have anticipated that someone would attack them.

The weekly march typically attracts fewer than 50 people each week, and it usually consists of older individuals, said Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the director of Chabad at the University of Colorado. Yet this week, “there happened to be children”, he said.

Four women and four men, aged between 52 and 88, were taken to hospitals in the Denver metro area for injuries sustained in the attack. One of the victims remains in critical condition.

Twelve people were wounded when a pro-Palestinian attacker threw incendiary devices into a crowd gathered in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Colorado on Sunday, police said.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with first-degree murder and a federal hate crime, records show, after the attack on a vigil in Boulder, Colorado, for Israeli hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Soliman shouted ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, according to law enforcement officials, and the FBI is investigating it as an act of terror. The Boulder Police Department said as of Monday afternoon that none of the victims have died.

Soliman is also facing felony charges for using explosives or incendiary devices, first-degree assault, and causing serious injury to the elderly, but prosecutors may decide on different charges. He is being held in Boulder County Jail on a $10 million bond.

What To Know

Eight of the 12 victims were aged between 52 and 88 and attending a Run for Their Lives rally, which was raising awareness for the hostages' ongoing plight.

One of the victims is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado.

""She is an amazing person,"" Wilhelm said.

Two victims were flown by helicopter to the University of Colorado Health's burn unit, the facility confirmed. Four of them were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said. Their ages range from 67 to 88.

The identities of the victims have not yet been released. All had been transferred or discharged by Sunday night, according to the hospital.

Boulder County Sheriff’s Department records show he was taken into custody on two charges of first-degree murder, among eight total counts, though state prosecutors have yet to file official charges. His arraignment is scheduled for Monday at 3:30 p.m ET. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also said Monday on Fox News the Department of Justice and FBI are investigating the attack as an act of terrorism.

What Else Do We Know About The Attack?

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said they do not believe any accomplice of the suspect was still at large and they have not been able to confirm initial reports suggesting there were two people involved in the attack. “We are not going to say that with absolute certainty, because we are still conducting a lot of interviews,” the police chief said. Michalek said there was no immediate indication that the suspect was linked any specific group, but noted that the investigation was still ongoing.

What Do We Know About The Event Targeted By The Attack?

The gathering targeted by the attack was organized by a national group called “Run for Their Lives”, which does weekly demonstrations to raise awareness about the hostages still being held by Hamas and its affiliates in Gaza. The group’s website describes the event as a weekly 1-kilometer (0.6-mile) walk or run. In a statement on Instagram, the group said their walk in Boulder was “disrupted in a violent assault that Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is calling a hate crime.” The statement added that Run for Their Lives is a “an apolitical global organization with the sole mission of walking peacefully to raise awareness for the 58 hostages still held in captivity by Hamas in Gaza.”

“My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community…As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot…Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

His arraignment is scheduled for Monday at 3:30 p.m ET. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also said Monday on Fox News the Department of Justice and FBI are investigating the attack as an act of terrorism.

What Else Do We Know About The Attack?

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said they do not believe any accomplice of the suspect was still at large and they have not been able to confirm initial reports suggesting there were two people involved in the attack. “We are not going to say that with absolute certainty, because we are still conducting a lot of interviews,” the police chief said. Michalek said there was no immediate indication that the suspect was linked any specific group, but noted that the investigation was still ongoing.

What Do We Know About The Event Targeted By The Attack?

The gathering targeted by the attack was organized by a national group called “Run for Their Lives”, which does weekly demonstrations to raise awareness about the hostages still being held by Hamas and its affiliates in Gaza. The group’s website describes the event as a weekly 1-kilometer (0.6-mile) walk or run. In a statement on Instagram, the group said their walk in Boulder was “disrupted in a violent assault that Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is calling a hate crime.” The statement added that Run for Their Lives is a “an apolitical global organization with the sole mission of walking peacefully to raise awareness for the 58 hostages still held in captivity by Hamas in Gaza.”

“My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community…As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot…Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

Huckabee said the reports were “contributing to the antisemitic climate” which resulted in the murder of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington and an attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Colorado.

Huckabee added in his Monday statement the accusation that the media sources had parroted Hamas and its collaborators' claims without authenticating the information.

In particular, Huckabee noted that the media outlets had reported claims that Palestinians seeking food boxes from the Gaza Humanitarian Fund were killed by the GHF, a claim that was proven false by the Israeli military.

“Drone video and first-hand accounts clearly showed that there were no injuries, no fatalities, no shooting, no chaos. It is Hamas that continues to terrorize and intimidate those who seek food aid,” Huckabee wrote. “The only source for these misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated stories came from Hamas sources, which are designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States.“

“The efforts of GHF have resulted in over 5 million meals to civilians without incident. For the New York Times, AP, and CNN to be part of a Hamas-fed false narrative is reprehensible. It represents more than mere sloppy journalism. It’s feeding and inciting violence against innocent people in the United States,” he added. “We are demanding an immediate retraction of the lies and are appealing to all media sources to act with objective professionalism to cover actual events instead of being a partner of terrorism by blindly following Hamas news releases.”

On Sunday, a pro-Palestinian attacker wounded a number of people with a Molotov cocktail and homemade flamethrower at a vigil for the 58 hostages remaining in Hamas captivity. Witnesses noted the attacker shouted a number of anti-Israel statements during the attack.",Huckabee asserted that the media sources responsible for the “libelous allegations” owe an apology and should “recant their fake news.”

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said.

Michalek named the suspect as Mohamed Soliman, who was hospitalized shortly after the attack. Reuters could not immediately locate contact information for him or his family.

FBI Director Kash Patel also described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be ""a hate crime given the group that was targeted."" Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved.

""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel.

In a statement, the group said the walks have been held every week since then for the hostages, ""without any violent incidents until today.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law.""

""The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,"" he said.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel, led by President Donald Trump, to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. His administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite U.S. universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

In a post to X, a social network, Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Soliman had overstayed his visa and been allowed to work by the previous administration. He said it was further evidence of the need to ""fully reverse"" what he described as ""suicidal migration.""

Reuters was not able to independently verify the suspect's immigration status. When asked about Soliman, the Department of Homeland Security said more information would be provided as it became available.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

""Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water,'"" Coffman said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said it was an antisemitic attack.

""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism,"" he said on X.

The attack follows last month's arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fueled polarization in the United States over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

The GAO released a new report Thursday, revealing some of the shortfalls in the process of reversing the decision to locate the new U.S. Space Command Headquarters at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville.

“The GAO report yet again affirms that Huntsville is the best option for Space Command’s headquarters. When making his decision to locate the combatant command headquarters in Huntsville, President Trump prioritized transparency, national security, and a commitment to saving taxpayer dollars,” said U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Saks). “Multiple GAO reports and the recent Inspector General’s report have validated this.”

Rogers, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said the actions by the Biden administration put partisan politics over national security.

“President Biden ignored multiple Air Force analyses and put his political ambitions above the welfare of the American people when he made the decision to put the headquarters in Colorado Springs,” he said. “President Biden cited ‘military readiness’ to justify his choice, but we now know his own administration officials repeatedly told him that Huntsville was the best location, and “military readiness” concerns were fictional.

“This blatant interference and politization of a critical decision on national security would cost the taxpayer over $420,000,000,” he added. “The contrast could not be clearer. President Trump chose the best location for SPACECOM headquarters. I look forward to working with the Trump Administration to rectify yet another one of Biden’s national security blunders.”

U.S. Rep. Dale Strong (R-Huntsville) said he believes the report is another reason the Trump administration will soon announce that Space Command HQ will be moved to Huntsville.

“This report was released and it says the same thing that Alabama already knows the cost to construct and maintain in Alabama would save the taxpayers of America $426 million,” Strong said. “You look, this report also talks about that what’s in Colorado is unsustainable. They’ve got multiple locations. It is not working like it should and all of it would have to be replaced.”

“We feel comfortable that we’re moving forward and I feel that Donald Trump’s going to do what’s right for national security and that is to bring Space Command to Huntsville,” he added. “That would be about 1,700 jobs with a 3,000-job spin-off.”

It is widely expected that the newly confirmed Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink will soon officially move the Space Command HQ back to Huntsville.

The Colorado River Basin spans over 246,000 square miles and supplies water to seven US states, including Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Arizona, Nevada, and California.

Researchers used more than two decades of satellite data to track water loss in the region.

Between April 2002 and October 2024, the basin lost more than 13 trillion gallons of freshwater that is nearly two-thirds of it from underground reserves.

Since 2003, nearly 28 million acre-feet of groundwater roughly the full capacity of Lake Mead has depleted, driven by unregulated pumping and drought.

They used data from NASA to monitor underground water loss.

It shows that since 2015, the groundwater has been depleting 2.4 times faster than surface water, marking a sharp acceleration in water loss.

The groundwater loss is driven largely by over-pumping in the Lower Colorado River Basin, particularly in Arizona, Nevada, and California where regulation is minimal or nonexistent.

Professor Jay Famiglietti, the study's senior from Arizona State University, said: 'Everyone in the US should be worried about it, because we grow a lot of food in the Colorado River Basin and that's food that's used all over the entire country.'

The Colorado River and its underground supply support everything from drinking water for cities like Los Angeles and Phoenix to massive agricultural operations growing water-heavy crops like alfalfa, much of which is exported.

'Over-pumping is the main cause of groundwater losses over the past 20 years,' Professor Famiglietti said. 'There's nothing illegal about it, it's just unprotected.'

The Colorado River Basin has long depended on snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains to refill its rivers, reservoirs, and aquifers.

But rising temperatures and droughts, driven by climate change, are shrinking snowpack and reducing surface water flow.

The decreasing supply of surface water is visually apparent throughout the region.

Lake Powell and Lake Mead have seen sharply falling levels, and the Colorado River's overall flow has diminished, a trend researchers say will likely continue if warming intensifies.

As surface water becomes less reliable, cities and farms are leaning more heavily on groundwater but that safety net is also collapsing.

'We used to say the Colorado River is the lifeblood of the western US,' Professor Famiglietti told The Guardian. 'Now it's becoming clear that groundwater is the lifeblood and it's vanishing.'

The study highlights that the Lower Basin including Arizona, Nevada, and parts of California has been hit hardest. Groundwater accounts for more than 71 percent of total water loss in that region.

Arizona in particular faces critical risk. Outside of designated management areas, groundwater pumping remains largely unregulated. As a result, wells are drying up, pumping costs are rising, and food security is under growing threat.

As groundwater vanishes, wells run dry, pumping costs rise, and food security is threatened.

About 80 percent of the Colorado River Basin's water goes to agriculture, supporting a $1.4 billion industry in Arizona alone, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The new study conducted by Arizona State University offers one of the most detailed looks yet at water loss in the Colorado River Basin.

Since 2015, most of the Colorado River Basin's freshwater loss has been driven by aggressive groundwater pumping in Arizona, where the absence of statewide regulations outside designated Active Management Areas has allowed unchecked extraction for agriculture and growing urban demand.

The research used satellite-based gravity data to measure changes in total water storage including snow, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater.

The Lower Basin, which includes Arizona, Nevada, and parts of California, was hit hardest, with groundwater making up more than 71 percent of its total water loss.

This isn't the first warning. Previous studies using NASA's data have documented steady groundwater declines in the region between 2003 and 2014.

But the latest research confirms that the pace of depletion has accelerated, especially since 2015.

The Colorado River's flow has dropped 13 percent below its 20th-century average in recent years, and if current warming trends continue, experts warn it could shrink by as much as 30 percent by mid-century.

States in the region were forced to reach a federal agreement in 2023 to limit water usage and try to protect the river's supply.

The more water that is lost from the river, Professor Famigletti told the Washington Post, 'the more pressure there's going to be on the groundwater' in the basin.

'And then,' he said, 'it becomes a ticking time bomb.'

Meanwhile, demand is only rising, with the region attracting water-intensive industries like data centers and semiconductor factories.",Officials have warned that 40 million Americans could soon lose access to drinking water as the nation's vital source of water is vanishing.

The image captures the battered face of Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, who cops say turned a homemade flamethrower on a group of Israeli hostage supporters and lobbed Molotov cocktails.

Soliman was in the US illegally after overstaying his visa, authorities said.

He originally entered the country legally through Los Angeles International Airport on a B2 visa on Aug. 27, 2022, sources told The Post and Fox News.

B2 visas are given to people who are supposed to be temporarily visiting the country for such things as tourism and to visit family and friends. Soliman’s visitor’s visa expired in February 2023, sources told The Post.

But the suspect meanwhile applied for asylum in September 2022, sources said. He also applied for a work visa.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with multiple felonies after allegedly shouting “Free Palestine” as he attacked the crowd on Sunday. The incident occurred during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, a group that aims to draw attention to people taken hostage following Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023.

The FBI is treating the attack as an “act of terrorism”, with Pam Bondi, the attorney general, saying that “FBI agents are on the ground in Colorado following what appears to be a horrific antisemitic attack”.

Hakeem Jeffries described the incident as targeting “the Jewish community in America” and called it an “unconscionable act of terror”. The House Democratic leader posted on X: “As residents of Boulder gathered on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot to raise awareness for the hostages still being held captive in Gaza, the peacefulness of their assembly was shattered.”

Many of Colorado’s politicians denounced the attack. Jason Crow, a Democratic representative, characterized the attack as “targeted political violence at the Jewish community meant to spread fear”, adding: “Antisemitism is real. Sadly, it’s on the rise in America.”

Another Colorado representative, Lauren Boebert, linked the attack to broader pro-Palestine rhetoric, saying: “When progressives allow and encourage hate speech toward Jews for their mere existence, people get hurt.” She called for the incident to be investigated “as an act of targeted terrorism”.

Michael Bennet, Colorado’s Democratic senator, said he and his wife were “praying for the victims of today’s horrific antisemitic attack against Coloradans marching peacefully in support of the hostages Hamas has held in Gaza for over 600 days”.

Joe Neguse, a representative of Colorado, said the attack demonstrated how “the scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country”, calling for more to “stop this violence”.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, close to the University of Colorado, on Sunday afternoon. Four women and four men, aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to “very serious”, according to Boulder police.

CNN, citing law enforcement officials, reported that Soliman arrived in the US in August 2022 as a non-immigrant visitor. It reported that the officials said he was granted a work authorization in March 2023, which expired at the end of March this year, more than two months into Trump’s presidency.

Soliman had previously applied for asylum in the US, CNN reported. He was denied a visa to enter the country in 2005.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, described Soliman as “an illegal alien” who had been “granted a tourist visa by the Biden administration” before overstaying.

The Boulder attack is the latest in a series of violent incidents in the US since the outset of the Israel-Gaza war. On 21 May, a shooter killed two Israeli embassy employees in Washington after attending an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee. Pro-Palestinian protesters have also been targeted, most notably at UCLA in April 2024 when counter-protesters attacked demonstrators with pepper spray, sticks and fireworks, injuring at least 15-16 people and requiring some hospitalizations. In December 2023, a man fired at three Palestinian students while they were walking down the street near their university in Vermont and wearing keffiyehs, with two sustaining injuries and one now paralyzed from the waist down.

Officials said there was no indication that Sunday’s attack was associated with any organized group. Soliman has been booked into Boulder county jail and has a hearing scheduled for Monday afternoon.

In their latest annual reports, the Anti-Defamation League says it has tabulated 9,354 antisemitic incidents over the last year, while the Council on American-Islamic Relations says it counted 8,658 complaints in the same span.

Huckabee said the reports were “contributing to the antisemitic climate” which resulted in the murder of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington and an attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Colorado.

Huckabee added in his Monday statement the accusation that the media sources had parroted Hamas and its collaborators' claims without authenticating the information.

In particular, Huckabee noted that the media outlets had reported claims that Palestinians seeking food boxes from the Gaza Humanitarian Fund were killed by the GHF, a claim that was proven false by the Israeli military.

“Drone video and first-hand accounts clearly showed that there were no injuries, no fatalities, no shooting, no chaos. It is Hamas that continues to terrorize and intimidate those who seek food aid,” Huckabee wrote. “The only source for these misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated stories came from Hamas sources, which are designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States.“

“The efforts of GHF have resulted in over 5 million meals to civilians without incident. For the New York Times, AP, and CNN to be part of a Hamas-fed false narrative is reprehensible. It represents more than mere sloppy journalism. It’s feeding and inciting violence against innocent people in the United States,” he added. “We are demanding an immediate retraction of the lies and are appealing to all media sources to act with objective professionalism to cover actual events instead of being a partner of terrorism by blindly following Hamas news releases.”

On Sunday, a pro-Palestinian attacker wounded a number of people with a Molotov cocktail and homemade flamethrower at a vigil for the 58 hostages remaining in Hamas captivity. Witnesses noted the attacker shouted a number of anti-Israel statements during the attack.",Huckabee asserted that the media sources responsible for the “libelous allegations” owe an apology and should “recant their fake news.”

Eight people were injured when the suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into a crowd.

The incident, which injured several elderly participants, has renewed concerns over rising antisemitic violence nationwide.

What we know:

Bass is calling for an emergency meeting at City Hall to evaluate security in Los Angeles.

This comes after what is being described as a ""terror"" attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.

The demonstrators were participating in a weekly gathering called ""Run for Their Lives,"" which raises awareness for hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas following the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. Witnesses said the suspect yelled ""Free Palestine"" during the attack.

According to officials, eight people—four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88—were hospitalized in Denver for burn injuries.

The victims were described as elderly and defenseless, and eyewitnesses reported scenes of panic and trauma at the outdoor mall where the incident occurred.

Boulder police took 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman into custody. Law enforcement officials—including bomb squad teams and K-9 units—shut down several city blocks while searching for additional devices.

Authorities now believe the suspect acted alone.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa and is in the country illegally.

He has been booked on charges that include murder in the first degree, although there have been no confirmed reports that any of the victims died. According to Boulder County Jail records, other charges against Soliman include first degree assault and crimes against an at-risk adult over 70.

Mayor Karen Bass issued a statement Sunday condemning the attack and announcing increased security in Los Angeles:

""What happened in Boulder, Colorado today — an especially brutal targeting of elders — is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,"" Bass said. ""This was the second terrorist attack against Jews in two weeks — I will be calling an emergency meeting at City Hall regarding safety and security here in Los Angeles immediately after Shavuot.""

""LAPD is conducting extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers throughout L.A. Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in this city.""

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa and is in the country illegally.

He has been booked on charges that include murder in the first degree, although there have been no confirmed reports that any of the victims died. According to Boulder County Jail records, other charges against Soliman include first degree assault and crimes against an at-risk adult over 70.

Mayor Karen Bass issued a statement Sunday condemning the attack and announcing increased security in Los Angeles:

""What happened in Boulder, Colorado today — an especially brutal targeting of elders — is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,"" Bass said. ""This was the second terrorist attack against Jews in two weeks — I will be calling an emergency meeting at City Hall regarding safety and security here in Los Angeles immediately after Shavuot.""

""LAPD is conducting extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers throughout L.A. Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in this city.""
• None Sunday: Demonstrators gathered for a weekly event organized by ""Run for Their Lives"" in Boulder.
• None Later Sunday: Mayor Bass issued her statement and announced extra LAPD patrols.
• None On May 21, in Washington, D.C., a man armed with a handgun opened fire on a group of people outside of the Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, killing two staff members of the Embassy of Israel.

What we don't know:

It’s unclear whether the attack is part of a broader trend of coordinated antisemitic violence or an isolated incident.

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., called for both the alleged perpetrator and his family to be kicked out of the United States in an interview with Fox News Digital Monday.

""I'm very angry, if you can't tell. Many of us have been talking about this stuff for years,"" Fine said sternly. ""Maybe next time somebody says, ‘Globalize the Intifada, resistance by any means necessary,’ maybe people will take it seriously.""

A man identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly threw Molotov cocktails and used a ""makeshift flamethrower"" to set peaceful Jewish activists on fire Sunday, according to officials. He allegedly yelled, ""Free Palestine,"" while committing the attack.

SUSPECT IN BOULDER TERROR ATTACK DETERMINED TO BE EGYPTIAN MAN IN US ILLEGALLY: FBI

""The entire Palestinian cause is a lie… The entire justification of the cause is to eradicate Israel and to exterminate Jews,"" Fine said.

""Find me a single person who yells, ‘Fee Palestine,’ who says they're OK with Israel existing. You won't find them. Find someone who says, ‘Globalize the intifada,’ who thinks Israel should exist. This is a philosophy built on evil. And this is what happens when we don't do anything about it.""

Fine told Fox News Digital that House Republicans' massive tax and spending reconciliation bill – President Donald Trump's ""one big, beautiful bill"" – would give the White House resources to help mitigate such risks.

""President Trump needs the resources to round up and deport every single illegal immigrant, everyone – number one, starting with the family of Mohamed, who's sitting at home illegally in Colorado right now.""

The immigration status of Soliman's relatives – and whether he has family in the U.S. – is not immediately clear.

But the Department of Homeland Security said Monday morning that the suspect was in the U.S. illegally. Spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wrote on X, ""He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.""

It comes after Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sources told Fox News that Soliman is an Egyptian immigrant who overstayed a visa but then was given a work permit during the Biden administration.

Eight people aged 52 to 88 were injured in the attack, including a Holocaust survivor. No fatalities have been reported so far. The activists were marching in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Soliman has been hit with multiple charges, including murder in the first degree.

""Jews were burned alive in the United States in 2025. We got burned 80 years ago, and we said, ‘Never again.’ And I'll be damned if I let this continue,"" Fine said.

He also called on Congress to pass his recent legislation that would make religion a protected class on college campuses, and for the U.S. to ""cut off"" Qatar's financial influence in the U.S.

Asked how he would accomplish that, Fine pointed out he had previously been given the nickname, ""Hebrew Hammer.""

""I didn't come up with it, but they gave it to me for a reason,"" Fine said.","Rep. Randy Fine is speaking out about the suspected terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, during a peaceful pro-Israel demonstration."

In the latest terrorist attack aimed at Jews, a pro-Palestinian terrorist used Molotov cocktails, a makeshift flamethrower, and other devices to kill and maim. He did this while shouting “free Palestine.”

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm (the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder) notified the media that one elderly Holocaust survivor was injured.

CBS News reports, “A walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place in Boulder’s downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled ‘End Zionist’ during the attack.”

Naturally, “free West Papua,” “free the Chittagong Hill Tracts,” “free the Yazidis,” “free Balochistan,” “free Darfur from Arab Muslim pogroms,” “free Tibet,” and so on, isn’t part of the daily media mantra – nor mentioned to a great extent by protesters.

The BBC reports, “Police said eight people – aged 52 to 88 – were injured in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver.”

Mark Michalek (Head of the FBI’s Denver office) named the suspect. He said Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is an Egyptian national.

Michalek said, “Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country.”

Only recently, two Israeli embassy employees were brutally killed by a pro-Palestinian terrorist. This happened in Washington (District of Columbia). Therefore, Jews are being targeted by pro-Palestinian terrorists in America – similar to how Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist forces single out Jews.

The politically correct mass media in the northern hemisphere, similar to Islamist media outlets, are whipping up anti-Israel and anti-Jewish hatred through biased reporting. After all, do the same media outlets focus daily on Arab Muslims butchering black Africans in Darfur, Arab Muslims killing each other in Yemen and mass malnutrtion, ISIS (Islamic State) holding Yazidi slaves, the Alawites residing in fear in Syria (brutal pogrom this year by Sunni Islamists against the Alawites), and other realities in West Asia?

Danny Danon (Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations) said, “Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said, “As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot.”

Polis continued, “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Pro-Palestinian terrorism in America is picking up from endless intimidation to killings and attacks on Jews with flamethrowers.

Accordingly, America is witnessing the same terrorist mechanisms that are used against Alawites, Christians, Jews, Shabaks, Yazidis, and other minorities in West Asia.

A pro-Israel group was sprayed with fire on Sunday at a peaceful demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, leaving eight people injured, almost all of them senior citizens.

A man shouting ""Free Palestine"" burned the victims with fire and threw Molotov cocktails into a crowd at a pedestrian mall in Boulder, scorching people who were walking to raise awareness for the plight of the Israeli hostages who have been held captive for more than 600 days in Gaza. The F.B.I. says it's investigating the incident as a terror attack.

One bureau official called it ""targeted terror,"" although the Boulder police chief was initially reluctant to call it terrorism.

Police arrested a subject identified as Mohamed Sobry Soliman, 45, an Egyptian national. Authorities did not share details about Soliman, who was reportedly injured in the attack.

The White House called Soliman an ""illegal alien."" White House Advisor Stephen Miller stated, “He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration, and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit.""

The victims were part of a weekly walking group called Run for Their Lives and ranged in age from 67 to 88. Their wounds were described as ranging from minor to serious.

Eyewitness Alex Osante said, ""I saw fire, I saw people falling and screaming and crying and tripping. I saw the attacker have a Molotov, he had three Molotov cocktails, one of them he threw inside of a group at the group, and one lady lit on fire from head to toe and then the other four people were also injured and in the fire but not as bad as the first one.""

Another eyewitness reported seeing ""shoots of fire, linear, about 20 feet long.""

The attack comes just two weeks after another man acting in the name of Palestinians reportedly admitted to the shooting deaths of two young staffers from the Israeli Embassy in Washington outside a Jewish museum.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who is Jewish, observed that the attack occurred on the eve of the Shavuot holiday.

“As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, DC, it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" he observed.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser issued a statement saying, ""This attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,"" noting that the people gathered to support the hostages were Jewish.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement, said he, his wife, and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the attack. He blamed the attack on ""blood libels against the Jewish state and people.""

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar posted on X, ""Shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder, Colorado.""

Sa'ar continued, ""This is pure antisemitism, fueled by the blood libels spread in the media. I spoke with our Ambassador in the US and our Consul General in LA. I pray for those who were wounded in the attack.""

The Jewish Community Relations Council of Colorado announced it is “outraged and heartbroken” over the attack.

The head of the group, Brandon Rattiner, added, “Our community has consistently warned that hateful and reductive rhetoric about Israel and Jews puts us in danger. We’re not being alarmist – we’re just paying attention. Violence against Jews is immoral and must end.”",Another devastating terror attack has been perpetrated against Jews here in America.

BREAKING: Three senior DHS sources tell @FoxNews that the Boulder terror suspect is an Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally as a visa overstay who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration. I’m told Mohamed Sabry Soliman arrived at LAX on 8/27/22 on a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through 2/26/23, but he overstayed & never left. I’m told on 9/29/22, he filed some sort of claim with USCIS, potentially an asylum claim, and on 3/29/23, USCIS under the Biden admin gave him work authorization, which expired on 3/28/25.

Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa. He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left. On Sept. 9, 2022, he filed a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

According to The New York Times, the FBI allowed a woman into the house with the agents. A neighbor said “a family with three children lived there.”

Soliman stands accused of attacking the “Run for Their Lives” pro-Israel vigil, a weekly activity to demand the release of Israeli hostages from Hamas.
• Murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent
• Murder in the first degree – extreme indifference
• Criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies
• Use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony.

I don’t know how Soliman faces murder charges since no one died.

Supposedly, Soliman waited for the group to show up for their weekly vigil.

The suspect set the victims on fire as he screamed, “Free Palestine.” The eight victims, four women and four men, are aged 52 to 99. One is in critical condition.

Therefore, Jews are being targeted by pro-Palestinian terrorists in America – similar to how Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist forces single out Jews.

The politically correct mass media in the northern hemisphere, similar to Islamist media outlets, are whipping up anti-Israel and anti-Jewish hatred through biased reporting. After all, do the same media outlets focus daily on Arab Muslims butchering black Africans in Darfur, Arab Muslims killing each other in Yemen and mass malnutrtion, ISIS (Islamic State) holding Yazidi slaves, the Alawites residing in fear in Syria (brutal pogrom this year by Sunni Islamists against the Alawites), and other realities in West Asia?

Danny Danon (Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations) said, “Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America.”

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said, “As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot.”

Polis continued, “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Pro-Palestinian terrorism in America is picking up from endless intimidation to killings and attacks on Jews with flamethrowers.

Accordingly, America is witnessing the same terrorist mechanisms that are used against Alawites, Christians, Jews, Shabaks, Yazidis, and other minorities in West Asia.

In the latest terrorist attack aimed at Jews, a pro-Palestinian terrorist used Molotov cocktails, a makeshift flamethrower, and other devices to kill and maim. He did this while shouting “free Palestine.”

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm (the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder) notified the media that one elderly Holocaust survivor was injured.

CBS News reports, “A walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place in Boulder’s downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled ‘End Zionist’ during the attack.”

Naturally, “free West Papua,” “free the Chittagong Hill Tracts,” “free the Yazidis,” “free Balochistan,” “free Darfur from Arab Muslim pogroms,” “free Tibet,” and so on, isn’t part of the daily media mantra – nor mentioned to a great extent by protesters.

The BBC reports, “Police said eight people – aged 52 to 88 – were injured in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver.”

Mark Michalek (Head of the FBI’s Denver office) named the suspect. He said Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is an Egyptian national.

BREAKING: Three senior DHS sources tell @FoxNews that the Boulder terror suspect is an Egyptian national in the U.S. illegally as a visa overstay who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration. I’m told Mohamed Sabry Soliman arrived at LAX on 8/27/22 on a B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through 2/26/23, but he overstayed & never left. I’m told on 9/29/22, he filed some sort of claim with USCIS, potentially an asylum claim, and on 3/29/23, USCIS under the Biden admin gave him work authorization, which expired on 3/28/25.

Soliman first arrived in the U.S. after landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 27, 2022, with a non-immigrant visa. He was authorized to stay through Feb. 2, 2023, but never left. On Sept. 9, 2022, he filed a claim with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

According to The New York Times, the FBI allowed a woman into the house with the agents. A neighbor said “a family with three children lived there.”

Soliman stands accused of attacking the “Run for Their Lives” pro-Israel vigil, a weekly activity to demand the release of Israeli hostages from Hamas.
• Murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent
• Murder in the first degree – extreme indifference
• Criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies
• Use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony.

I don’t know how Soliman faces murder charges since no one died.

Supposedly, Soliman waited for the group to show up for their weekly vigil.

The suspect set the victims on fire as he screamed, “Free Palestine.” The eight victims, four women and four men, are aged 52 to 99. One is in critical condition.

UPDATE (8:25 AM): The suspect in Sunday's attack on a march supporting Israeli hostages held by Hamas is potentially facing two counts of first-degree murder.

The Boulder County Sheriff's Office says 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman could be charged with one count of first-degree murder with extreme indifference and another first-degree murder charge listed as ""deliberation with intent non-family gun.""

Soliman could also be charged with one count of attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, one count of causing serious injury to an at-risk adult or someone over 70 and one count of using explosives or incendiary devices.

He was booked late Sunday night, and his bail has been set at $10 million.

Eight people were hospitalized with burns and other injuries from the attack, authorities have said.

BOULDER, Colo. (NBC, KYMA/KECY) - Boulder police say several people were injured, one critically, at an outdoor mall during a pro-Israel march.

""It is clear this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" said Special Agent Mark Michalek with the FBI Denver Office.

Videos from the scene show a man shouting and waving bottles filled with some kind of liquid.

Authorities now identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman. Two senior law enforcement officials say he's an Egyptian national, and while the investigation is in the early stages, he appears to have acted alone.

Police arrested him at the scene.

""They immediately ran into a chaotic situation where a man was throwing Molotov cocktails and using other devices to hurt people,"" said Chief Stephen Redfearn with the Boulder Police Department.

Witnesses then joined in, rushing to help the victims between the ages of 52 to 88, some with very serious burns.

""I was like how can I help and they had like really bad burns on their legs and I went over to this other grass area by the front entrance and there was another lady on the ground with bad burns on her legs like screaming,"" said Brooke Coffman, a witness.

The attack follows the deadly shooting, less than two weeks ago, of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and said at least one of them was in critical condition.

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said.

Mr. Michalek named the suspect Mohamed Soliman, who was hospitalized shortly after the attack. Reuters could not immediately locate contact information for him or his family.

FBI Director Kash Patel also described the incident as a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved.

“We’re fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,” he said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas’ 2023 attack on Israel.

In a statement, the group said the walks have been held every week since then for the hostages, “without any violent incidents until today.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law.”

“The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,” he said.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel’s war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel, led by President Donald J. Trump, to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. His administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite US universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

In a post to X, a social network, Mr. Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr. Soliman had overstayed his visa and been allowed to work by the previous administration. He said it was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration.”

Reuters was not able to independently verify the suspect’s immigration status. When asked about Soliman, the Department of Homeland Security said more information would be provided as it became available.

VICTIMS BURNED

 Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

“Everybody is yelling, ‘get water, get water,’” Coffman said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said it was an antisemitic attack.

“This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism,” he said on X.

The attack follows last month’s arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, DC. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fueled polarization in the United States over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, told investigators that he wanted to ""kill all Zionist people"" but had delayed committing the attack until after his daughter had graduated from high school, according to state and federal court documents charging him with attempted murder, assault and a federal hate crime.

Police and FBI affidavits quoted the suspect as saying he took firearms training to obtain a concealed-carry permit but ended up using Molotov cocktails because of his immigration status. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the fire bombs from YouTube.

Federal authorities said Soliman was in the country illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa and an expired work permit.

Trump administration officials immediately seized on Sunday's violence as an example of why they are cracking down on illegal immigration.

A police affidavit filed in support of Soliman's arrest warrant said he was born in Egypt, lived in Kuwait for 17 years and moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, about 100 miles (161 km) south of Boulder, where he lived with his wife and five children.

""In light of yesterday’s horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X.

Federal and local authorities at an afternoon news conference in Boulder said Soliman had done nothing to draw law enforcement attention before Sunday's incident. He was believed to have acted alone, they said.

According to the Boulder police affidavit, Soliman had planned for a year to carry out the attack, which unfolded on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado.

The affidavit said the suspect ""threw two lit Molotov cocktails at individuals participating in the pro-Israel gathering,"" yelling, ""Free Palestine"" as they ignited in the crowd.

The victims, many of them elderly, were taking part in an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel.

The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans linked to outrage over Israel's escalating military offensive in Gaza. It followed the fatal shooting of two Israel Embassy aides that took place outside Washington's Capital Jewish Museum last month.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi described the fire-bombing as an ""antisemitic terror attack.""

Authorities said they found 16 gasoline-filled Molotov cocktails near where the suspect was detained.

The police also found a gasoline canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with gasoline at the scene. The federal affidavit references a video posted on social media during the attack showing Soliman ""shirtless, pacing back and forth while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails.""

During a brief court appearance on Monday, Soliman appeared via a video feed from the Boulder County Jail, wearing an orange jumpsuit. He answered ""yes"" to some procedural questions from the judge but otherwise did not speak.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, said during the hearing that she would reserve any arguments regarding his bond conditions until a future date. He was initially detained in lieu of $10 million cash bail.

The suspect faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty on the federal hate crime charge because he was also charged with attempted-murder in state court.

The multiple attempted-murder counts are punishable by up to 384 years in prison, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said.

Department of Homeland Security officials said Soliman had entered the United States in August 2022 on a tourist visa, filed for asylum the following month, and remained in the country after his visa expired in February 2023.

""There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren't properly screened that were allowed in,"" Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said during a press conference in Boston.

In a social media post, U.S. President Donald Trump called Sunday's attack ""yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.""

Under former President Joe Biden, ICE prioritized arrests of serious criminals and called for officers to consider humanitarian factors when detaining migrants.

Authorities had identified eight victims by late Sunday - four women and four men, 52 to 88 years of age. Two victims remained hospitalized on Monday. In addition, four more victims who were less seriously injured came forward on Monday.

Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told CBS Colorado that the 88-year-old victim was a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

The 'Red Planet' is the fourth from the Sun

NASA has shared huge news about a discovery made on Mars. After a decade of searching, NASA’s MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere Volatile Evolution) mission has reported a direct observation of an elusive atmospheric escape process called sputtering.

The new observation could help answer longstanding questions about the history of water loss on Mars. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbours, as well as Venus.

Robotic explorers, like NASA's Perseverance rover and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter serve as pathfinders to eventually get astronauts to the surface of the Red Planet. The plan to get astronauts onto the planet is well underway and the space agency is aiming to achieve this landmark achievement in the 2030s.

Scientists have known for a long time that water was present on Mars’ surface billions of years ago, there is an abundance of evidence that has been collected over the years. However, a key question asked by NASA is “where did the water go and why?”

Early on in Mars’ history, the atmosphere of the Red Planet lost its magnetic field, and its atmosphere became directly exposed to the solar wind and solar storms. This meant that liquid water was no longer stable on the surface and as a result, much of it escaped the planet, entering space.

NASA stated on May 29 that ""sputtering could explain it"", this is an atmospheric escape process in which atoms are knocked out of the atmosphere by energetic charge particles.

Shannon Curry, principal investigator of MAVEN at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder and lead author of the study, explained: ""it's like doing a cannonball into a pool. The cannonball, in this case, is the heavy ions crashing into the atmosphere really fast and splashing neutral atoms and molecules out.""

This is the first time the process of sputtering has been observed directly. Scientists has only found traces of evidence previously. Discussing the major breakthrough in further detail, Curry added: ""It is like we found the ashes from a campfire. But we wanted to see the actual fire, in this case sputtering, directly.""

According to NASA: ""To observe sputtering, the team needed simultaneous measurements in the right place at the right time from three instruments aboard the MAVEN spacecraft: the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer, the Magnetometer, and the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer.

""Additionally, the team needed measurements across the dayside and the nightside of the planet at low altitudes, which takes years to observe.""

After the data from the instruments was looked at by scientists, they discovered that that this process is happening at a rate ""four times higher"" than previously predicted and that this rate increases during solar storms.

The direct observation of sputtering confirms that the process was a primary source of atmospheric loss in Mars’ early history when the Sun’s activity was much stronger.

Curry commented further: ""These results establish sputtering’s role in the loss of Mars’ atmosphere and in determining the history of water on Mars."" The new finding has been described as ""critical"" by the space agency, for scientists' understanding of the conditions that allowed liquid water to exist on the Martian surface.

Last month, NASA made a 'step towards Mars'. As the planet is dry, rocky and bitter cold, a lot of planning and organisation has gone into preparing for future missions to the celestial object.

Outlining plans for living and working on Mars, the space agency is focusing on oxygen, food, water, power, spacesuits, communications and shelter. One day on Mars lasts about 37 minutes longer than an Earth day, and a year on the planet is almost twice as long as it is on our planet.

The 'Red Planet' is the fourth from the Sun

NASA has shared huge news about a discovery made on Mars. After a decade of searching, NASA’s MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere Volatile Evolution) mission has reported a direct observation of an elusive atmospheric escape process called sputtering.

The new observation could help answer longstanding questions about the history of water loss on Mars. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbours, as well as Venus.

Robotic explorers, like NASA's Perseverance rover and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter serve as pathfinders to eventually get astronauts to the surface of the Red Planet. The plan to get astronauts onto the planet is well underway and the space agency is aiming to achieve this landmark achievement in the 2030s.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and said at least one of them was in critical condition.

""As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said.

Michalek named the suspect as Mohamed Soliman, who was hospitalized shortly after the attack. Reuters could not immediately locate contact information for him or his family.

FBI Director Kash Patel also described the incident as a ""targeted terror attack,"" and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be ""a hate crime given the group that was targeted."" Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved.

""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel.

In a statement, the group said the walks have been held every week since then for the hostages, ""without any violent incidents until today.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold-blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law.""

""The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,"" he said.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel's war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel, led by President Donald Trump, to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. His administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite U.S. universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

In a post on the social platform X, Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Soliman had overstayed his visa and been allowed to work by the previous administration. He said it was further evidence of the need to ""fully reverse"" what he described as ""suicidal migration.""

Reuters was not able to independently verify the suspect's immigration status. When asked about Soliman, the Department of Homeland Security said more information would be provided as it became available.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

""Everybody is yelling, 'get water, get water,'"" Coffman said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said it was an antisemitic attack.

""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism,"" he said on X.

The attack follows last month's arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fueled polarization in the United States over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

Federal and local authorities are investigating Sunday’s incident as an act of terrorism.

The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, entered the U.S. in August 2022 and remained after his visa expired in February 2023, according to Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokeswoman. She said that Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022, but did not share details about the status of his claim.

“The Colorado terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” McLaughlin told TIME in a statement.

Soliman was arrested Sunday after authorities said he used a makeshift flamethrower to assault participants in a weekly march called Run for Their Lives, held in downtown Boulder to draw attention to the 58 hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas after the group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Witnesses said he shouted “Free Palestine” as he threw an incendiary device into the crowd.

At least eight people, ranging from ages 52 to 88, were hospitalized with burns and other injuries, authorities said. Four additional victims who sustained “more minor” injuries were identified on Monday after they came forward to be interviewed, according to Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn. Boulder Police said Monday morning that none of the victims have died.

Soliman, who was living in Colorado Springs, was also injured and taken to a hospital to be medically evaluated before being booked into the Boulder County Jail on multiple charges. He faces 16 counts of first-degree attempted murder, two counts of use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device, District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Monday. The Justice Department also charged Soliman with a federal hate crime, according to an affidavit. He is being held on a $10 million bond.

“The facts we have at this time make it clear that this is a targeted act of violence,” said Redfearn at a Sunday evening press conference. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement that the attack “appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.”

The incident has stirred anxiety within the Jewish community, which has already been reeling from a series of recent attacks. Two weeks ago, two Israeli Embassy aides were shot and killed outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. And in April, a man set fire to the home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

Here’s what to know about Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack.

The Trump Administration on Monday said that Soliman entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa, which typically allows stays of up to six months, and remained illegally after it expired in February 2023. He had applied for asylum in September 2022, but his claim may have been delayed amid a court backlog of more than 3.6 million cases.

In a social media post, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called the suspect an “illegal alien” and criticized the Biden Administration for approving his work permit. “Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” Miller said.

The Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment on the status of his asylum claim.

Little else is publicly known about Soliman’s time in the U.S. or what he was doing in Colorado before the attack.

During the incident, he is heard on video saying “How many children have you killed?” and “We have to end Zionists, they are killers.” One law enforcement official told CNN that following the attack he said, “I did it to avenge my people.”

An F.B.I. affidavit said that Soliman confessed to the attack and told police he would do it again. He told investigators that he had researched and planned the attack for more than a year, according to court documents.

Soliman also told authorities he had previously tried to buy a firearm but could not because he is not a legal citizen, so instead used Molotov cocktails, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado J. Bishop Grewell said Monday.

Sixteen unused Molotov cocktails were found in Soliman's vicinity at the time of his arrest, law enforcement officials said.

President Donald Trump expressed condolences for the victims on Truth Social. “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” he said in a post, claiming that Soliman “came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” and that “he must go out under ‘TRUMP’ Policy.”

Did he act alone?

“At this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone,” Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, Mark Michalek, said at a Monday afternoon press conference. But he noted that authorities “do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads.”

“If we uncover evidence that others knew of this attack or supported the subject in this attack, rest assured that we will aggressively move to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” he said.

The F.B.I. searched Soliman’s home in Colorado Springs on Sunday after he was identified as the suspect. There was no immediate indication that he was linked to any particular organization or group, authorities said.

The attack follows last month's arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fueled polarization in the United States over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is an Egyptian citizen who had overstayed a tourist visa and was living illegally in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security said Monday. He entered the U.S. in August 2022 and remained after his visa expired in February 2023, according to Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. She said that Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022, but did not share details about the status of his claim.

“The Colorado terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” McLaughlin told TIME in a statement. Soliman was arrested Sunday after authorities said he used a makeshift flamethrower to assault participants in a weekly march called Run for Their Lives, held in downtown Boulder to draw attention to the 58 hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas after the group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Witnesses said he shouted “Free Palestine” as he threw an incendiary device into the crowd.At least fifteen people, ranging in age from 25 to 88, were injured in the attack, as well as a dog. Authorities said at least eight were hospitalized with burns and other injuries.

He faces 28 counts of first-degree attempted murder on the state level, as well as a number of assault, explosives, and other charges, according to court documents. The Justice Department has also charged Soliman with a federal hate crime. He is being held on a $10 million bond.

Soliman’s wife and five children were taken into ICE custody on Tuesday, the White House said in a post on its official X account, adding that they could be deported as soon as that night under expedited removal. A federal judge temporarily blocked their deportation in a Wednesday ruling. Hearings are set to be held in the case next week. Federal and local authorities are investigating Sunday’s attack as an act of terrorism. “The facts we have at this time make it clear that this is a targeted act of violence,” said Redfearn at a Sunday evening press conference. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement that the attack “appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” The incident has stirred anxiety within the Jewish community, which has already been reeling from a series of recent attacks. Two weeks ago, two Israeli Embassy aides were shot and killed outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. And in April, a man set fire to the home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish.

The Trump Administration on Monday said that Soliman entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa, which typically allows stays of up to six months, and remained illegally after it expired in February 2023. He had applied for asylum in September 2022, but his claim may have been delayed amid a court backlog of more than 3.6 million cases.

The Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately return a request for comment on the status of his asylum claim. During the incident, he is heard on video saying “How many children have you killed?” and “We have to end Zionists, they are killers.” One law enforcement official told CNN that following the attack he said, “I did it to avenge my people.” An F.B.I. affidavit said that Soliman confessed to the attack and told police he would do it again. He told investigators that he had researched and planned the attack for more than a year, according to court documents. Soliman also told authorities he had previously tried to buy a firearm but could not because he is not a legal citizen, so instead used Molotov cocktails, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado J. Bishop Grewell said Monday. Sixteen unused Molotov cocktails were found in Soliman's vicinity at the time of his arrest, law enforcement officials said.

President Donald Trump expressed condolences for the victims on Truth Social. “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” he said in a post, claiming that Soliman “came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” and that “he must go out under ‘TRUMP’ Policy.” Read more: Ehud Barak: Israel Must Back Donald Trump’s Deal To End the War in Gaza Did he act alone? “At this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone,” Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, Mark Michalek, said at a Monday afternoon press conference. But he noted that authorities “do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads.” “If we uncover evidence that others knew of this attack or supported the subject in this attack, rest assured that we will aggressively move to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” he said.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a post on X on Tuesday announcing the detainment of Soliman’s wife and children that authorities were “investigating to what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it.”

Soliman is next set to appear in court for a preliminary hearing in the federal hate crime case on June 18. A preliminary hearing in the state case is set for July 15.",Authorities are investigating Mohamed Sabry Soliman’s attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Boulder as an act of terrorism.

This is a critical element of deterrence: If a nuclear-armed enemy perceives the command structure to be vulnerable, it may consider attempting a nuclear decapitation strike.

Today, the United States faces not only Russia’s nuclear forces but also a Chinese nuclear arsenal that is growing at an unprecedented rate. Beijing’s nuclear force, which experts estimated at roughly 200 warheads a few years ago, has already tripled to some 600 warheads today. Moreover, the most recent U.S. Defense Department report on the Chinese military, released in December 2024, suggests that Beijing is on its way to more than 1,000 warheads by 2030. No wonder that in 2021, the then-head of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Charles Richard, described the growth of the Chinese arsenal as “breathtaking.” (Under the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty expiring in 2026, the United States and Russia are each allowed to deploy 1,550 warheads, but these numbers are less important for protecting the command structure than the exotic nuclear capabilities that Washington’s adversaries have been developing.)

The Chinese buildup has given rise to discussion of the so-called three-body problem: How can one nuclear power simultaneously deter two nuclear peers?​

Further complicating this complex situation is tightening cooperation between Russia and China. U.S. nuclear planners face not only the challenge of simultaneously deterring two adversaries and the risks of opportunistic aggression, but they also need to plan for the possibility of a combined Sino-Russian nuclear attack. Actions such as the recent joint Chinese-Russian strategic bomber patrols near Alaska demonstrate that this is not just a theoretical concern.

Of particular concern is the fact that both China and Russia are developing—and in some cases deploying—capabilities that could threaten the United States’ nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) system. These capabilities include anti-satellite systems, cyberweapons, and hypersonic delivery vehicles that have been designed to evade U.S. missile defenses.

These emerging capabilities raise a specter that the U.S. government has not had to face for at least 35 years: the prospect of nuclear decapitation. As recently as 2013, the Obama administration’s report on the U.S. nuclear employment strategy concluded that the nation faced a “significantly diminished possibility of a disarming surprise nuclear attack.” Today, Russian and Chinese capabilities have created a dramatically different situation.

A nuclear decapitation attack would seek to eliminate the U.S. president and his or her designated successors—the so-called National Command Authority—and to damage the NC3 system to the extent that it prevents a U.S. retaliatory response. The possibility of such a decapitation attack, however slight, “is probably the only imaginable route to decisive victory in nuclear war,” international relations scholar John Steinbruner wrote in Foreign Policy in 1981. U.S. nuclear planners learned during the Cold War that a robust nuclear deterrent must rely not only on assured means of delivering nuclear weapons but also on an equally robust NC3 system. “Weapons and strategic doc­trine are meaningless,” future U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter observed in 1985, without “the means to know what is happening in the chaos of crisis or war, to provide for deci­sions by legitimate authorities and to have orders carried out precisely and faithfully.”

Failure to fully fund ongoing efforts to modernize the U.S. NC3 system could encourage the illusion among the United States’ nuclear adversaries that a decapitating first strike might succeed.

This is not a far-fetched theory. Beijing clearly sees counter-space operations a way to “blind and deafen the enemy,” according to the Pentagon report. It has tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon that left tens of thousands of pieces of space debris in orbit; it subsequently launched a rocket that apparently reached its apogee at roughly 30,000 kilometers, which U.S. officials believe was probably a test to intercept a geosynchronous satellite. Beijing has deployed multiple ground-based lasers that can currently “disrupt, degrade, or damage” space-based sensors and ultimately destroy satellites. Recently, China has reportedly had some of its satellites engage in “dogfighting” in space.

In July 2021, China tested a system that would appear to provide it with a capability akin to the fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) that the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War. The main advantage of such a system, and virtually its only use, is to conduct a strike with little or no warning.

In January, the Financial Times reported that satellite photography had shown “deep holes that military experts assess will house large, hardened bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during any conflict—including potentially a nuclear war.” This huge facility—about 10 times the size of the Pentagon—would be the “world’s largest military command centre” and, according to former U.S. intelligence officer Dennis Wilder, would provide China with an “advanced nuclear warfighting capability.”

For their part, Russian officials have said the country’s new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Sarmat, is essentially a FOBS capability. Never one for subtlety, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a speech in 2018 that featured an animation of the system on a trajectory over the South Pole striking a target in Florida that was suspiciously close to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.

Like China, Russia has tested an anti-satellite capability in the past several years. In November 2021, Russia destroyed a defunct Soviet-era communications satellite in low-Earth orbit using its Nudol direct-ascent anti-satellite missile; the test endangered other spacecraft, including the International Space Station and China’s Tiangong Space Station.

Most alarmingly, the Russians appear to be developing a satellite that would carry a nuclear weapon in space. U.S. and Soviet tests of nuclear weapons in space during the Cold War showed that such a weapon would threaten commercial satellites as well as military spacecraft. Russia’s April 2024 veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution reaffirming the Outer Space Treaty’s ban on nuclear weapons in space underscores concerns about Russian intentions.

Russia has also modernized its NC3. In 2011, the then-director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Gen. Ronald Burgess, testified before Congress that “Russia is upgrading massive underground facilities that provide command and control of its strategic nuclear forces.” In late 2020, Putin announced the completion of “an absolutely secure facility for controlling strategic nuclear forces … and that it will have a very high safety margin.”

Although Russia and China have spent the past decade and a half modernizing and expanding their nuclear forces and associated capabilities, the United States has only belatedly begun its nuclear modernization. The Defense Department is currently modernizing its early-warning radars and satellites, as well as its space-based communications systems. But several other elements of the NC3 system demand special attention to ensure their survivability.

First is what’s known as continuity of operations/continuity of government (COOP/COG). When the Carter and Reagan administrations faced the fears of decapitation that resulted from the Soviet nuclear buildup of the 1970s, they both moved to refresh and exercise COOP/COG procedures in case of nuclear attack, including direct participation or observation by senior officials, including President Ronald Reagan.

Subsequent administrations have largely let COOP/COG languish. The one exception was after 9/11, when the Bush administration gave it renewed attention in the face of potential government decapitation resulting from a terrorist attack. But as real and serious as that threat may be, it is of a totally different order than the risk represented by peer nuclear adversaries seeking to not only decapitate the U.S. government but the entire NC3 system.

A refresh of COOP/COG procedures would benefit by helping U.S. officials to understand the potential risks of nuclear decapitation as well as the fixed and mobile airborne facilities that exist to ensure the survival of the nation’s leaders and line of command.

The second element of NC3 requiring attention is the survivability of mobile alternate command posts. The United States has maintained several fixed sites as alternatives to the Pentagon’s National Military Command Center, including Stratcom’s Global Operations Center at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska; the Raven Rock Mountain Complex in Pennsylvania; and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado, near the headquarters of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command.

These fixed sites, however, would be prime targets for any nuclear decapitation attempt. During the Cold War, the Kennedy administration determined that decapitating the U.S. leadership might require only a relatively small missile force. Ever since then, the United States has invested in an airborne component of the NC3 architecture to provide a survivable command center. These included the National Emergency Airborne Command Post, later replaced by the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center, as well as the Navy’s Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) aircraft to provide a mechanism for connectivity in a crisis to the ballistic missile submarine fleet and an alternate airborne launch control system for ICBMs.

In today’s new context, the modernization of these mobile command posts is crucial to reinforcing deterrence by raising doubts about the effectiveness of decapitation as a strategy. This is particularly urgent given the heavy investment that Russia and China are making in counter-space capabilities. The U.S. Air Force is currently modernizing the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center through the Survivable Airborne Operations Center program, a $13 billion effort to replace, by 2036, legacy 1970s-era aircraft with a fleet of adapted civilian aircraft fitted out with modern communications, networks, and advanced command and control subsystems.

Meanwhile, the Navy is upgrading its TACAMO aircraft to extend their service life until 2038. The first block of upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2023 in nearly record time.

The challenge of deterring two nuclear peers simultaneously will continue to bedevil the United States for years to come. But the first order of business is to ensure that NC3 remains robust, the programs to support it are fully funded, and upgraded capabilities are delivered on time.",New Russian and Chinese weapons make Washington’s nuclear command structure vulnerable to attack.

President Donald Trump has expressed his sympathy for the eight victims wounded at a vigil in Boulder, Colorado, for hostages held by Hamas.

And, expressing his anger over the violence, he added in a social media post that the flamethrower attack ""WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.""

Recent footage of starving Gazans and disputes around humanitarian aid supplies have intensified calls to end the Gaza Strip conflict. At Least 31 people were reported to have died there on Sunday after Israeli troops fired on a crowd. The IDF denied attacking civilians. Since October 7, 2023, when Hamas led an attack against Israel, killing 1,200 and abducting 251 people, 54,000 people have been killed in the Strip by Israel's counteroffensive, according to The Associated Press. Israel has said 58 hostages remain in Gaza, and Trump has said 21 remain alive.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was arrested on Sunday after allegedly throwing bottles of flammable liquid at people attending the vigil. He yelled ""free Palestine"" during the attack, according to officials, and the FBI said the attack was being investigated as terrorism. Of the eight people injured, including a Holocaust survivor, two were wounded seriously and taken to a burns unit.

What to Know

Trump responded to the attack in a post to Truth Social Monday afternoon.

""Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,"" Trump wrote. ""He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under 'TRUMP' Policy.""

He continued, ""Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!""

Soliman, 45, was booked on charges including murder in the first degree, though police have not said anyone died in the attack. He also faces felony charges for using explosives or incendiary devices, first-degree assault, and causing serious injury to the elderly, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reported that there were at least 9,354 antisemitic attacks in the U.S. in 2024, a 344 percent increase over the past five years, in a report released in April. A majority of those attacks ""contained elements related to Israel or Zionism,"" the report read.

Senior White House official Stephen Miller wrote on X that the suspect had been granted a tourist visa by the Biden administration and ""illegally overstayed that visa.""

What People Are Saying

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, wrote on X: ""I am horrified by last night's horrific attack in Boulder. My heart is with the victims and our Jewish communities across the country. Antisemitism is on the rise here at home, and we have a moral responsibility to confront and stop it everywhere it exists.""

Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, on X: ""As the American Jewish community continues to reel from the horrific antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C, it is unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot no less. Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. I condemn this vicious act of terrorism, and pray for the recovery of the victims.""

Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X: ""FBI agents are on the ground in Colorado following what appears to be a horrific antisemitic attack. My heart and my prayers are with the Jewish community. We will not tolerate this hatred and we will put the perpetrator of this violence behind bars.""

What Happens Next

Mohamed Sabry Soliman remains in custody at Boulder County Jail and is scheduled to appear in court at 1:30 p.m. local time on Monday. He is being held on a $10 million bond.

Eight people in Boulder were taken to hospitals after a man wielding a makeshift flamethrower and hurling an incendiary device attacked a crowd of people participating in a demonstration calling for the release of hostages in Gaza, police said.

Suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was in the U.S. illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told HuffPost on Monday. The man was heard yelling “Free Palestine” while carrying out the afternoon violence, which injured four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, local authorities said.

Soliman was charged with a federal hate crime Monday, according to court documents.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday afternoon that pointedly blamed his predecessor for the violence and repeated his campaign for mass deportations.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” he said.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who in the wake of the attack has directed local law enforcement agencies to bolster security efforts at Jewish places of worship, also called for the suspect to be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.”

“Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,” the Democrat said in a statement Sunday. “Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.”

Colorado’s Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper also slammed the violence, with Bennet asserting that “hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado.”

“In recent years, antisemitism has reached unprecedented levels in the U.S. — leading to attacks like this hate-fueled incident in Boulder and the recent murders in Washington, D.C.,” Bennet said in a statement that also cited the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers. The suspect in that attack said, “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,” upon his arrest, according to an FBI special agent’s affidavit in the case.

“It is particularly painful that this attack occurred as the Jewish community prepares to celebrate Shavuot. We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to combating antisemitism in all of its forms,” Bennet added.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) expressed similar sentiments, with all three calling it a shared responsibility to stand up against antisemitic acts.

“When antisemitism is allowed to fester, when it spreads unchecked, and when too many look the other way, history has shown us where it leads: to hatred, to violence, to terror,” Schumer said.

“Antisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed,” Jeffries said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were targeted “simply because they were Jews” and that he expected the “cold blood perpetrator” would be prosecuted to “the fullest extent of the law.”

“The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,” he said.

Several Trump administration officials have spoken out, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sharing that her department is monitoring the incident and “praying for the victims and their families.”

“This violence must stop,” she posted on social media.

FBI Director Kash Patel also said his agency is “fully investigating” what his deputy director called a suspected “act of ideologically motivated violence.”

“We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence. All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation,” Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a statement.

Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller meanwhile also blamed Joe Biden’s administration for the suspect’s ability to carry out the attack.

“Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” he said. “Immigration security is national security.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) similarly blamed the Biden administration for what happened.

“This act of terror could have been prevented, but Biden made a mockery of our national security and America is paying the price for his failures,” he posted on social media.

“What happened in Boulder, Colorado today — an especially brutal targeting of elders — is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,” Bass said. “This was the second terrorist attack against Jews in two weeks.”

Bass noted that the Los Angeles Police Department is conducting extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers throughout the city. “Antisemitism will not be tolerated in this city,” she said.

The emergency meeting will happen after the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, celebrated from sundown Sunday through sundown Tuesday, to celebrate when Moses and the Israelites were given the Torah at Mount Sinai.

In Colorado, suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was taken into custody and booked on charges that included murder in the first degree, although there have been no confirmed reports that any of the victims died.

Moreover, the most recent U.S. Defense Department report on the Chinese military, released in December 2024, suggests that Beijing is on its way to more than 1,000 warheads by 2030. No wonder that in 2021, the then-head of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Charles Richard, described the growth of the Chinese arsenal as “breathtaking.” (Under the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty expiring in 2026, the United States and Russia are each allowed to deploy 1,550 warheads, but these numbers are less important for protecting the command structure than the exotic nuclear capabilities that Washington’s adversaries have been developing.)

The Chinese buildup has given rise to discussion of the so-called three-body problem: How can one nuclear power simultaneously deter two nuclear peers?​

Further complicating this complex situation is tightening cooperation between Russia and China. U.S. nuclear planners face not only the challenge of simultaneously deterring two adversaries and the risks of opportunistic aggression, but they also need to plan for the possibility of a combined Sino-Russian nuclear attack. Actions such as the recent joint Chinese-Russian strategic bomber patrols near Alaska demonstrate that this is not just a theoretical concern.

Of particular concern is the fact that both China and Russia are developing—and in some cases deploying—capabilities that could threaten the United States’ nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) system. These capabilities include anti-satellite systems, cyberweapons, and hypersonic delivery vehicles that have been designed to evade U.S. missile defenses.

These emerging capabilities raise a specter that the U.S. government has not had to face for at least 35 years: the prospect of nuclear decapitation. As recently as 2013, the Obama administration’s report on the U.S. nuclear employment strategy concluded that the nation faced a “significantly diminished possibility of a disarming surprise nuclear attack.” Today, Russian and Chinese capabilities have created a dramatically different situation.

A nuclear decapitation attack would seek to eliminate the U.S. president and his or her designated successors—the so-called National Command Authority—and to damage the NC3 system to the extent that it prevents a U.S. retaliatory response. The possibility of such a decapitation attack, however slight, “is probably the only imaginable route to decisive victory in nuclear war,” international relations scholar John Steinbruner wrote in Foreign Policy in 1981. U.S. nuclear planners learned during the Cold War that a robust nuclear deterrent must rely not only on assured means of delivering nuclear weapons but also on an equally robust NC3 system. “Weapons and strategic doc­trine are meaningless,” future U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter observed in 1985, without “the means to know what is happening in the chaos of crisis or war, to provide for deci­sions by legitimate authorities and to have orders carried out precisely and faithfully.”

Failure to fully fund ongoing efforts to modernize the U.S. NC3 system could encourage the illusion among the United States’ nuclear adversaries that a decapitating first strike might succeed.

This is not a far-fetched theory. Beijing clearly sees counter-space operations a way to “blind and deafen the enemy,” according to the Pentagon report. It has tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon that left tens of thousands of pieces of space debris in orbit; it subsequently launched a rocket that apparently reached its apogee at roughly 30,000 kilometers, which U.S. officials believe was probably a test to intercept a geosynchronous satellite. Beijing has deployed multiple ground-based lasers that can currently “disrupt, degrade, or damage” space-based sensors and ultimately destroy satellites. Recently, China has reportedly had some of its satellites engage in “dogfighting” in space.

In July 2021, China tested a system that would appear to provide it with a capability akin to the fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) that the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War. The main advantage of such a system, and virtually its only use, is to conduct a strike with little or no warning.

In January, the Financial Times reported that satellite photography had shown “deep holes that military experts assess will house large, hardened bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during any conflict—including potentially a nuclear war.” This huge facility—about 10 times the size of the Pentagon—would be the “world’s largest military command centre” and, according to former U.S. intelligence officer Dennis Wilder, would provide China with an “advanced nuclear warfighting capability.”

For their part, Russian officials have said the country’s new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Sarmat, is essentially a FOBS capability. Never one for subtlety, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a speech in 2018 that featured an animation of the system on a trajectory over the South Pole striking a target in Florida that was suspiciously close to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.

Like China, Russia has tested an anti-satellite capability in the past several years. In November 2021, Russia destroyed a defunct Soviet-era communications satellite in low-Earth orbit using its Nudol direct-ascent anti-satellite missile; the test endangered other spacecraft, including the International Space Station and China’s Tiangong Space Station.

Most alarmingly, the Russians appear to be developing a satellite that would carry a nuclear weapon in space. U.S. and Soviet tests of nuclear weapons in space during the Cold War showed that such a weapon would threaten commercial satellites as well as military spacecraft. Russia’s April 2024 veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution reaffirming the Outer Space Treaty’s ban on nuclear weapons in space underscores concerns about Russian intentions.

Russia has also modernized its NC3. In 2011, the then-director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Gen. Ronald Burgess, testified before Congress that “Russia is upgrading massive underground facilities that provide command and control of its strategic nuclear forces.” In late 2020, Putin announced the completion of “an absolutely secure facility for controlling strategic nuclear forces … and that it will have a very high safety margin.”

Although Russia and China have spent the past decade and a half modernizing and expanding their nuclear forces and associated capabilities, the United States has only belatedly begun its nuclear modernization. The Defense Department is currently modernizing its early-warning radars and satellites, as well as its space-based communications systems. But several other elements of the NC3 system demand special attention to ensure their survivability.

First is what’s known as continuity of operations/continuity of government (COOP/COG). When the Carter and Reagan administrations faced the fears of decapitation that resulted from the Soviet nuclear buildup of the 1970s, they both moved to refresh and exercise COOP/COG procedures in case of nuclear attack, including direct participation or observation by senior officials, including President Ronald Reagan.

Subsequent administrations have largely let COOP/COG languish. The one exception was after 9/11, when the Bush administration gave it renewed attention in the face of potential government decapitation resulting from a terrorist attack. But as real and serious as that threat may be, it is of a totally different order than the risk represented by peer nuclear adversaries seeking to not only decapitate the U.S. government but the entire NC3 system.

A refresh of COOP/COG procedures would benefit by helping U.S. officials to understand the potential risks of nuclear decapitation as well as the fixed and mobile airborne facilities that exist to ensure the survival of the nation’s leaders and line of command.

The second element of NC3 requiring attention is the survivability of mobile alternate command posts. The United States has maintained several fixed sites as alternatives to the Pentagon’s National Military Command Center, including Stratcom’s Global Operations Center at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska; the Raven Rock Mountain Complex in Pennsylvania; and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado, near the headquarters of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command.

These fixed sites, however, would be prime targets for any nuclear decapitation attempt. During the Cold War, the Kennedy administration determined that decapitating the U.S. leadership might require only a relatively small missile force. Ever since then, the United States has invested in an airborne component of the NC3 architecture to provide a survivable command center. These included the National Emergency Airborne Command Post, later replaced by the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center, as well as the Navy’s Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) aircraft to provide a mechanism for connectivity in a crisis to the ballistic missile submarine fleet and an alternate airborne launch control system for ICBMs.

In today’s new context, the modernization of these mobile command posts is crucial to reinforcing deterrence by raising doubts about the effectiveness of decapitation as a strategy. This is particularly urgent given the heavy investment that Russia and China are making in counter-space capabilities. The U.S. Air Force is currently modernizing the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center through the Survivable Airborne Operations Center program, a $13 billion effort to replace, by 2036, legacy 1970s-era aircraft with a fleet of adapted civilian aircraft fitted out with modern communications, networks, and advanced command and control subsystems.

Meanwhile, the Navy is upgrading its TACAMO aircraft to extend their service life until 2038. The first block of upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2023 in nearly record time.

The challenge of deterring two nuclear peers simultaneously will continue to bedevil the United States for years to come. But the first order of business is to ensure that NC3 remains robust, the programs to support it are fully funded, and upgraded capabilities are delivered on time.",New Russian and Chinese weapons make Washington’s nuclear command structure vulnerable to attack.

But he had second thoughts and only threw two out of the 18 incendiary devices he had into the group of about 20 people, yelling ""Free Palestine"" and accidentally burning himself, police said. Twelve people were injured in the Sunday attack. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn't spray it on anyone but himself ""because he had planned on dying.""

“He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” police wrote in an affidavit. He didn’t carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before.”

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime. The suspect’s first name also was spelled Mohammed in some court documents.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado said during a press conference Monday.

Federal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment.

During a state court hearing Monday, Soliman appeared briefly via a video link from the Boulder County Jail wearing an orange jumpsuit. Another court hearing is set for Thursday. Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after the hearing.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled ""Free Palestine"" was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

The victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88, and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. All four of the latest victims had what police described as minor injuries.

Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.

The volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration when video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails."" A police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Witness Alex Osante of San Diego said he was across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking and a “boom” followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.

Soliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, police wrote.

Osante said that after the suspect threw the two incendiary devices, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw the second, he took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.

District Attorney Michael Dougherty said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were recovered by law enforcement. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said.

Soliman told investigators he constructed the devices after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Soliman also told investigators he took a concealed carry class and tried to buy a gun but was denied because he is not a legal U.S. citizen.

Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

In video and photos shot right after the attack by a woman at the gathering, Soliman can be seen pacing without his shirt on with what appears to be burns down one of his arms. He and a small group of people around him are screaming at each other, with some witnesses filming him.

Soliman, who was born in Egypt, moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five kids, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his wife as kindly neighbors with three young kids and two teenagers who’d play with Pruiett’s kids.

Another neighbor, Kierra Johnson, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman’s home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.

This story has been updated to correct that the suspect's first name is spelled Mohamed, not Mohamad.

Eight people in Boulder were taken to hospitals after a man wielding a makeshift flamethrower and hurling an incendiary device attacked a crowd of people participating in a demonstration calling for the release of hostages in Gaza, police said.

Suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was in the U.S. illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told HuffPost on Monday. The man was heard yelling “Free Palestine” while carrying out the afternoon violence, which injured four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, local authorities said.

Soliman was charged with a federal hate crime Monday, according to court documents.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday afternoon that pointedly blamed his predecessor for the violence and repeated his campaign for mass deportations.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” he said.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who in the wake of the attack has directed local law enforcement agencies to bolster security efforts at Jewish places of worship, also called for the suspect to be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.”

“Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,” the Democrat said in a statement Sunday. “Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.”

Colorado’s Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper also slammed the violence, with Bennet asserting that “hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado.”

“In recent years, antisemitism has reached unprecedented levels in the U.S. — leading to attacks like this hate-fueled incident in Boulder and the recent murders in Washington, D.C.,” Bennet said in a statement that also cited the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers. The suspect in that attack said, “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,” upon his arrest, according to an FBI special agent’s affidavit in the case.

“It is particularly painful that this attack occurred as the Jewish community prepares to celebrate Shavuot. We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to combating antisemitism in all of its forms,” Bennet added.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) expressed similar sentiments, with all three calling it a shared responsibility to stand up against antisemitic acts.

“When antisemitism is allowed to fester, when it spreads unchecked, and when too many look the other way, history has shown us where it leads: to hatred, to violence, to terror,” Schumer said.

“Antisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed,” Jeffries said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were targeted “simply because they were Jews” and that he expected the “cold blood perpetrator” would be prosecuted to “the fullest extent of the law.”

“The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,” he said.

Several Trump administration officials have spoken out, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sharing that her department is monitoring the incident and “praying for the victims and their families.”

“This violence must stop,” she posted on social media.

FBI Director Kash Patel also said his agency is “fully investigating” what his deputy director called a suspected “act of ideologically motivated violence.”

“We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence. All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation,” Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a statement.

Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller meanwhile also blamed Joe Biden’s administration for the suspect’s ability to carry out the attack.

“Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” he said. “Immigration security is national security.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) similarly blamed the Biden administration for what happened.

“This act of terror could have been prevented, but Biden made a mockery of our national security and America is paying the price for his failures,” he posted on social media.

The Jewish festival that started hours after Boulder, Colorado, attack","Sunday afternoon’s attack in Boulder, Colorado, took place hours before the start of a major Jewish festival, Shavuot.

Authorities say a man threw two incendiary devices into a group holding one of its regular rallies in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a “targeted terror attack.”

Shavuot (pronounced Shah-voo-OTE), Hebrew for “weeks,” has been observed since biblical times. It marks the passing of seven weeks (49 days) from the holiday of Passover, with Shavuot falling on the 50th day.

In biblical times, Shavuot was an agricultural festival, when Israelites would bring harvest offerings to the temple.

Today, it’s primarily commemorated as the traditional date on which God gave the Torah — the law that forms the heart of the Jewish Scriptures — to Moses on Mount Sinai, as described in the Bible.

The 50-day time period gives the festival its Greek name, Pentecost, which is also the name for a holy day on the Christian calendar.

Shavuot falls on the 6th of Sivan on the Jewish calendar, which reckons days as beginning at sundown. This year, Shavuot began Sunday evening and continues for one or two days, depending on tradition.

For Jews inside Israel and for Reform Jews, the festival lasts for one day. Other traditions outside of Israel observe Shavuot for two days, ending Tuesday evening this year. (The variation stems from different traditions on when to observe lunar holidays, which historically were based on moon observations in ancient Israel.)

Shavuot typically falls in May or June on the Gregorian calendar.

Jews celebrate with readings of the biblical book of Exodus, including the Ten Commandments. Some mark the occasion with all-night readings from the Torah and other religious texts. Observant Jews refrain from work on Shavuot. The biblical book of Ruth, about a woman who embraces the Jewish faith, is often read and studied.

Shavuot celebrations are often marked by the consumption of dairy products, such as cheesecake and cheese-filled blintzes. Explanations for this tradition vary; one is that the Torah is like nourishing milk for the spirit.

Reform Judaism has traditionally connected Shavuot to its rite of confirmation for teens, in which they affirmed their commitment to Jewish life.

Tragically, this year’s Shavuot is not the first time in recent memory that Jews have marked a normally festive holiday in grim circumstances.

Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, claiming about 1,200 lives, took place on Simchat Torah, a date when Jews celebrate the completion of their year-long cycle of Torah readings.

Sunday’s gathering in Boulder was to raise attention for the 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, who are still being held by Hamas.

A statement from Rabbi Yisroel and Leah Wilhelm, directors of the Rohr Chabad House at the University of Colorado in Boulder, asked people to celebrate the holiday while keeping the victims in their prayers.

“We encourage everyone to respond energetically to this attack by celebrating Shavuot joyously, by attending the reading of the Ten Commandments, and by recommitting to the heritage and traditions we hold so dear,” they said.

“It is particularly painful that this attack occurred as the Jewish community prepares to celebrate Shavuot. We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to combating antisemitism in all of its forms,” Bennet added.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) expressed similar sentiments, with all three calling it a shared responsibility to stand up against antisemitic acts.

“When antisemitism is allowed to fester, when it spreads unchecked, and when too many look the other way, history has shown us where it leads: to hatred, to violence, to terror,” Schumer said.

“Antisemitism has no place in our nation or anywhere throughout the world. It must be crushed,” Jeffries said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were targeted “simply because they were Jews” and that he expected the “cold blood perpetrator” would be prosecuted to “the fullest extent of the law.”

“The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,” he said.

Several Trump administration officials have spoken out, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sharing that her department is monitoring the incident and “praying for the victims and their families.”

“This violence must stop,” she posted on social media.

FBI Director Kash Patel also said his agency is “fully investigating” what his deputy director called a suspected “act of ideologically motivated violence.”

“We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence. All of the necessary assets will be dedicated to this investigation,” Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a statement.

Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller meanwhile also blamed Joe Biden’s administration for the suspect’s ability to carry out the attack.

“Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” he said. “Immigration security is national security.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) similarly blamed the Biden administration for what happened.

“This act of terror could have been prevented, but Biden made a mockery of our national security and America is paying the price for his failures,” he posted on social media.

Eight people in Boulder were taken to hospitals after a man wielding a makeshift flamethrower and hurling an incendiary device attacked a crowd of people participating in a demonstration calling for the release of hostages in Gaza, police said.

Suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was in the U.S. illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told HuffPost on Monday. The man was heard yelling “Free Palestine” while carrying out the afternoon violence, which injured four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, local authorities said.

Soliman was charged with a federal hate crime Monday, according to court documents.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” President Donald Trump said in a statement Monday afternoon that pointedly blamed his predecessor for the violence and repeated his campaign for mass deportations.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” he said.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who in the wake of the attack has directed local law enforcement agencies to bolster security efforts at Jewish places of worship, also called for the suspect to be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.”

“Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days,” the Democrat said in a statement Sunday. “Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.”

Colorado’s Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper also slammed the violence, with Bennet asserting that “hate and violence of any kind will not be tolerated in Colorado.”

This is a critical element of deterrence: If a nuclear-armed enemy perceives the command structure to be vulnerable, it may consider attempting a nuclear decapitation strike.

The United States is rapidly moving into a new era that will force it to confront some of the most complex and challenging questions about nuclear weapons since the dawn of the nuclear age. We will soon be in a world where Russia and China each possess nuclear arsenals on par with the United States’—and where the probability of great-power war is growing.

As the Strategic Posture Commission established by Congress noted in 2023, this is “an existential challenge for which the United States is ill-prepared, unless its leaders make decisions now to adjust the U.S. strategic posture.” One essential element of this challenge involves ensuring that the national command authority—the ability of the U.S. president and key military advisors to be in communication with U.S. nuclear (and conventional) forces at all times—remains intact and protected. This is a critical element of deterrence: If a nuclear-armed enemy perceives the command structure to be vulnerable, it may consider attempting a nuclear decapitation strike.

Today, the United States faces not only Russia’s nuclear forces but also a Chinese nuclear arsenal that is growing at an unprecedented rate. Beijing’s nuclear force, which experts estimated at roughly 200 warheads a few years ago, has already tripled to some 600 warheads today. Moreover, the most recent U.S. Defense Department report on the Chinese military, released in December 2024, suggests that Beijing is on its way to more than 1,000 warheads by 2030. No wonder that in 2021, the then-head of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Charles Richard, described the growth of the Chinese arsenal as “breathtaking.” (Under the terms of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty expiring in 2026, the United States and Russia are each allowed to deploy 1,550 warheads, but these numbers are less important for protecting the command structure than the exotic nuclear capabilities that Washington’s adversaries have been developing.)

The Chinese buildup has given rise to discussion of the so-called three-body problem: How can one nuclear power simultaneously deter two nuclear peers?​

Further complicating this complex situation is tightening cooperation between Russia and China. U.S. nuclear planners face not only the challenge of simultaneously deterring two adversaries and the risks of opportunistic aggression, but they also need to plan for the possibility of a combined Sino-Russian nuclear attack. Actions such as the recent joint Chinese-Russian strategic bomber patrols near Alaska demonstrate that this is not just a theoretical concern.

Of particular concern is the fact that both China and Russia are developing—and in some cases deploying—capabilities that could threaten the United States’ nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) system. These capabilities include anti-satellite systems, cyberweapons, and hypersonic delivery vehicles that have been designed to evade U.S. missile defenses.

These emerging capabilities raise a specter that the U.S. government has not had to face for at least 35 years: the prospect of nuclear decapitation. As recently as 2013, the Obama administration’s report on the U.S. nuclear employment strategy concluded that the nation faced a “significantly diminished possibility of a disarming surprise nuclear attack.” Today, Russian and Chinese capabilities have created a dramatically different situation.

A nuclear decapitation attack would seek to eliminate the U.S. president and his or her designated successors—the so-called National Command Authority—and to damage the NC3 system to the extent that it prevents a U.S. retaliatory response. The possibility of such a decapitation attack, however slight, “is probably the only imaginable route to decisive victory in nuclear war,” international relations scholar John Steinbruner wrote in Foreign Policy in 1981. U.S. nuclear planners learned during the Cold War that a robust nuclear deterrent must rely not only on assured means of delivering nuclear weapons but also on an equally robust NC3 system. “Weapons and strategic doc­trine are meaningless,” future U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter observed in 1985, without “the means to know what is happening in the chaos of crisis or war, to provide for deci­sions by legitimate authorities and to have orders carried out precisely and faithfully.”

Failure to fully fund ongoing efforts to modernize the U.S. NC3 system could encourage the illusion among the United States’ nuclear adversaries that a decapitating first strike might succeed.

This is not a far-fetched theory. Beijing clearly sees counter-space operations a way to “blind and deafen the enemy,” according to the Pentagon report. It has tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon that left tens of thousands of pieces of space debris in orbit; it subsequently launched a rocket that apparently reached its apogee at roughly 30,000 kilometers, which U.S. officials believe was probably a test to intercept a geosynchronous satellite. Beijing has deployed multiple ground-based lasers that can currently “disrupt, degrade, or damage” space-based sensors and ultimately destroy satellites. Recently, China has reportedly had some of its satellites engage in “dogfighting” in space.

In July 2021, China tested a system that would appear to provide it with a capability akin to the fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) that the Soviet Union developed during the Cold War. The main advantage of such a system, and virtually its only use, is to conduct a strike with little or no warning.

In January, the Financial Times reported that satellite photography had shown “deep holes that military experts assess will house large, hardened bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during any conflict—including potentially a nuclear war.” This huge facility—about 10 times the size of the Pentagon—would be the “world’s largest military command centre” and, according to former U.S. intelligence officer Dennis Wilder, would provide China with an “advanced nuclear warfighting capability.”

For their part, Russian officials have said the country’s new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Sarmat, is essentially a FOBS capability. Never one for subtlety, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a speech in 2018 that featured an animation of the system on a trajectory over the South Pole striking a target in Florida that was suspiciously close to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.

Like China, Russia has tested an anti-satellite capability in the past several years. In November 2021, Russia destroyed a defunct Soviet-era communications satellite in low-Earth orbit using its Nudol direct-ascent anti-satellite missile; the test endangered other spacecraft, including the International Space Station and China’s Tiangong Space Station.

Most alarmingly, the Russians appear to be developing a satellite that would carry a nuclear weapon in space. U.S. and Soviet tests of nuclear weapons in space during the Cold War showed that such a weapon would threaten commercial satellites as well as military spacecraft. Russia’s April 2024 veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution reaffirming the Outer Space Treaty’s ban on nuclear weapons in space underscores concerns about Russian intentions.

Russia has also modernized its NC3. In 2011, the then-director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Gen. Ronald Burgess, testified before Congress that “Russia is upgrading massive underground facilities that provide command and control of its strategic nuclear forces.” In late 2020, Putin announced the completion of “an absolutely secure facility for controlling strategic nuclear forces … and that it will have a very high safety margin.”

Although Russia and China have spent the past decade and a half modernizing and expanding their nuclear forces and associated capabilities, the United States has only belatedly begun its nuclear modernization. The Defense Department is currently modernizing its early-warning radars and satellites, as well as its space-based communications systems. But several other elements of the NC3 system demand special attention to ensure their survivability.

First is what’s known as continuity of operations/continuity of government (COOP/COG). When the Carter and Reagan administrations faced the fears of decapitation that resulted from the Soviet nuclear buildup of the 1970s, they both moved to refresh and exercise COOP/COG procedures in case of nuclear attack, including direct participation or observation by senior officials, including President Ronald Reagan.

Subsequent administrations have largely let COOP/COG languish. The one exception was after 9/11, when the Bush administration gave it renewed attention in the face of potential government decapitation resulting from a terrorist attack. But as real and serious as that threat may be, it is of a totally different order than the risk represented by peer nuclear adversaries seeking to not only decapitate the U.S. government but the entire NC3 system.

A refresh of COOP/COG procedures would benefit by helping U.S. officials to understand the potential risks of nuclear decapitation as well as the fixed and mobile airborne facilities that exist to ensure the survival of the nation’s leaders and line of command.

The second element of NC3 requiring attention is the survivability of mobile alternate command posts. The United States has maintained several fixed sites as alternatives to the Pentagon’s National Military Command Center, including Stratcom’s Global Operations Center at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska; the Raven Rock Mountain Complex in Pennsylvania; and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado, near the headquarters of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command.

These fixed sites, however, would be prime targets for any nuclear decapitation attempt. During the Cold War, the Kennedy administration determined that decapitating the U.S. leadership might require only a relatively small missile force. Ever since then, the United States has invested in an airborne component of the NC3 architecture to provide a survivable command center. These included the National Emergency Airborne Command Post, later replaced by the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center, as well as the Navy’s Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) aircraft to provide a mechanism for connectivity in a crisis to the ballistic missile submarine fleet and an alternate airborne launch control system for ICBMs.

In today’s new context, the modernization of these mobile command posts is crucial to reinforcing deterrence by raising doubts about the effectiveness of decapitation as a strategy. This is particularly urgent given the heavy investment that Russia and China are making in counter-space capabilities. The U.S. Air Force is currently modernizing the E-4B National Airborne Operations Center through the Survivable Airborne Operations Center program, a $13 billion effort to replace, by 2036, legacy 1970s-era aircraft with a fleet of adapted civilian aircraft fitted out with modern communications, networks, and advanced command and control subsystems.

Meanwhile, the Navy is upgrading its TACAMO aircraft to extend their service life until 2038. The first block of upgraded aircraft was delivered in 2023 in nearly record time.

The challenge of deterring two nuclear peers simultaneously will continue to bedevil the United States for years to come. But the first order of business is to ensure that NC3 remains robust, the programs to support it are fully funded, and upgraded capabilities are delivered on time.",New Russian and Chinese weapons make Washington’s nuclear command structure vulnerable to attack.

President Donald Trump has expressed his sympathy for the eight victims wounded at a vigil in Boulder, Colorado, for hostages held by Hamas.

And, expressing his anger over the violence, he added in a social media post that the flamethrower attack ""WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.""

Recent footage of starving Gazans and disputes around humanitarian aid supplies have intensified calls to end the Gaza Strip conflict. At Least 31 people were reported to have died there on Sunday after Israeli troops fired on a crowd. The IDF denied attacking civilians. Since October 7, 2023, when Hamas led an attack against Israel, killing 1,200 and abducting 251 people, 54,000 people have been killed in the Strip by Israel's counteroffensive, according to The Associated Press. Israel has said 58 hostages remain in Gaza, and Trump has said 21 remain alive.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was arrested on Sunday after allegedly throwing bottles of flammable liquid at people attending the vigil. He yelled ""free Palestine"" during the attack, according to officials, and the FBI said the attack was being investigated as terrorism. Of the eight people injured, including a Holocaust survivor, two were wounded seriously and taken to a burns unit.

Soliman, 45, was booked on charges including murder in the first degree, though police have not said anyone died in the attack. He also faces felony charges for using explosives or incendiary devices, first-degree assault, and causing serious injury to the elderly, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reported that there were at least 9,354 antisemitic attacks in the U.S. in 2024, a 344 percent increase over the past five years, in a report released in April. A majority of those attacks ""contained elements related to Israel or Zionism,"" the report read.

In addition to including speakers from Hungary and throughout Europe, the two-day conference also featured American and Israeli speakers, including for a key conversation between Israeli commentator Yaír Netanyahu and Bryan Leib, a senior fellow at the Center for Fundamental Rights in the United States.

CPAC, in Hungary and the United States, has had a decidedly pro-Israel view, but this year felt different. Just over a week before the conference began, two Israeli embassy staff members were murdered outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC. Before beginning the conversation, Leib asked audience members to stand for a moment of silence for the victims, Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky.

Since October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, there has been a significant amount of pro-Hamas and antisemitic protests going on in the United States and around the world. This especially includes but is not limited to college campuses. Hostages kept captive by Hamas--with terrorists taking approximately 250 that day and close to 60 still being held--were even taunted by images of terrorist sympathizers at Columbia University, which has been a particularly problematic institution.

When it comes to these protests, Netanyahu made a particularly crucial point about the so-called ""Free Palestine"" movements, which is that it's not really about ""Palestine"" at all. Rather, these protests are about the red-green alliance, Netanyahu explained, which represents the Marxists (red) and the Islamists (green) partnering together in an effort to destroy Judeo-Christian values and western civilization.

At pro-Israel demonstrations, we're used to seeing the Israel flags, and, if the event takes place in the United States, an American flag, Leib and Netanyahu also touched upon. When pro-Hamas activity takes place, however, the American and Israeli flags are burned. Burning these flags, Netanyahu stressed, makes clear their intentions are really about ""destroying western civilization.""

The United States and the world have seen calls for globalizing the intifada. Unfortunately, we've seen that actually means happening in real time with targeted attacks against Jews at home.

Not only had a terrorist attack against Israeli employees taken place a week before the conference began, but days later, as Townhall has been covering, Mohamed Soliman allegedly targeted pro-Israel participants of a ""Run for Their Lives"" event in Boulder, Colorado. Soliman is reportedly an illegal immigrant from Egypt who had overstayed his visa. As those who have been sharing footage of the horrific attack on social media have pointed out, they're not just burning flags anymore, which speaks to Netanyahu's point during the conversation with Leib last Thursday, they're burning people.

Later on Thursday, Ben Shapiro touched upon a variety of topics during a Question & Answer period. Israel was referenced for having birth rates above replacement level, unlike much of the rest of the world, but also because Shapiro was quite candid in his views on the Israel-Hamas conflict.

As Leib and Netanyahu had discussed, and Shapiro also touched upon, Hamas comes for ""first the Saturday people, then the Sunday people,"" in reference to terrorists targeting not just Jews but also Christians. Shapiro also strongly spoke out against those who claim Israel is committing a genocide. As he pointed out, they are using ""ulterior motive that is not factually driven.""

There was also mockery for those who would be pro-Hamas and yet support the LGBTQ+ movement, specifically at the ignorance of those who ""have a Hamas armband and a rainbow flag,"" which is ""so historically ignorant,"" Shapiro also warned that such ignorance is ""societal suicide.""

Leib also spoke with Townhall at the conference after he had his conversation with Netanyahu about the importance of such a message at the conference. ""CPAC Hungary is more than a conference—it’s a coalition building event of sovereign nations rising to meet the defining challenge of our time. When the United States, Hungary, Israel, and patriots from across Europe come together, we are not just strengthening alliances, we are standing united to protect our borders, preserve our national cultures, and defend the principle of sovereignty in the face of globalist pressures. This is how we secure freedom for the next generation,"" he shared.

Since Sunday's attack, Leib has posted and reposted extensively, emphasizing in particular how important it is for Jews to be armed. This includes troubling video of the suspect.",

Four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88 were taken to hospitals in Denver for treatment Sunday after a suspect used a makeshift flame thrower and threw an incendiary device into a crowd walking in a weekly event to call for the return of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas militants during an attack on Israel Oct. 7, 2023.

TERROR ATTACK: What we know about the suspect and victims in the Boulder attack

“What happened in Boulder, Colorado today — an especially brutal targeting of elders — is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,” Bass said. “This was the second terrorist attack against Jews in two weeks.”

Bass noted that the Los Angeles Police Department is conducting extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers throughout the city. “Antisemitism will not be tolerated in this city,” she said.

The emergency meeting will happen after the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, celebrated from sundown Sunday through sundown Tuesday, to celebrate when Moses and the Israelites were given the Torah at Mount Sinai.

In Colorado, suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was taken into custody and booked on charges that included murder in the first degree, although there have been no confirmed reports that any of the victims died. Other charges included first degree assault and crimes against an at-risk adult over 70, according to Boulder County Jail records.",Karen Bass calls attack “an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles.”

The Jewish festival that started hours after Boulder, Colorado, attack","Sunday afternoon’s attack in Boulder, Colorado, took place hours before the start of a major Jewish festival, Shavuot.

Authorities say a man threw two incendiary devices into a group holding one of its regular rallies in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a “targeted terror attack.”

Shavuot (pronounced Shah-voo-OTE), Hebrew for “weeks,” has been observed since biblical times. It marks the passing of seven weeks (49 days) from the holiday of Passover, with Shavuot falling on the 50th day.

In biblical times, Shavuot was an agricultural festival, when Israelites would bring harvest offerings to the temple.

Today, it’s primarily commemorated as the traditional date on which God gave the Torah — the law that forms the heart of the Jewish Scriptures — to Moses on Mount Sinai, as described in the Bible.

The 50-day time period gives the festival its Greek name, Pentecost, which is also the name for a holy day on the Christian calendar.

Shavuot falls on the 6th of Sivan on the Jewish calendar, which reckons days as beginning at sundown. This year, Shavuot began Sunday evening and continues for one or two days, depending on tradition.

For Jews inside Israel and for Reform Jews, the festival lasts for one day. Other traditions outside of Israel observe Shavuot for two days, ending Tuesday evening this year. (The variation stems from different traditions on when to observe lunar holidays, which historically were based on moon observations in ancient Israel.)

Shavuot typically falls in May or June on the Gregorian calendar.

Jews celebrate with readings of the biblical book of Exodus, including the Ten Commandments. Some mark the occasion with all-night readings from the Torah and other religious texts. Observant Jews refrain from work on Shavuot. The biblical book of Ruth, about a woman who embraces the Jewish faith, is often read and studied.

Shavuot celebrations are often marked by the consumption of dairy products, such as cheesecake and cheese-filled blintzes. Explanations for this tradition vary; one is that the Torah is like nourishing milk for the spirit.

Reform Judaism has traditionally connected Shavuot to its rite of confirmation for teens, in which they affirmed their commitment to Jewish life.

Tragically, this year’s Shavuot is not the first time in recent memory that Jews have marked a normally festive holiday in grim circumstances.

Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, claiming about 1,200 lives, took place on Simchat Torah, a date when Jews celebrate the completion of their year-long cycle of Torah readings.

Sunday’s gathering in Boulder was to raise attention for the 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, who are still being held by Hamas.

A statement from Rabbi Yisroel and Leah Wilhelm, directors of the Rohr Chabad House at the University of Colorado in Boulder, asked people to celebrate the holiday while keeping the victims in their prayers.

“We encourage everyone to respond energetically to this attack by celebrating Shavuot joyously, by attending the reading of the Ten Commandments, and by recommitting to the heritage and traditions we hold so dear,” they said.

President Donald Trump has expressed his sympathy for the eight victims wounded at a vigil in Boulder, Colorado, for hostages held by Hamas.

And, expressing his anger over the violence, he added in a social media post that the flamethrower attack ""WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.""

Recent footage of starving Gazans and disputes around humanitarian aid supplies have intensified calls to end the Gaza Strip conflict. At Least 31 people were reported to have died there on Sunday after Israeli troops fired on a crowd. The IDF denied attacking civilians. Since October 7, 2023, when Hamas led an attack against Israel, killing 1,200 and abducting 251 people, 54,000 people have been killed in the Strip by Israel's counteroffensive, according to The Associated Press. Israel has said 58 hostages remain in Gaza, and Trump has said 21 remain alive.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was arrested on Sunday after allegedly throwing bottles of flammable liquid at people attending the vigil. He yelled ""free Palestine"" during the attack, according to officials, and the FBI said the attack was being investigated as terrorism. Of the eight people injured, including a Holocaust survivor, two were wounded seriously and taken to a burns unit.

What to Know

Trump responded to the attack in a post to Truth Social Monday afternoon.

""Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,"" Trump wrote. ""He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under 'TRUMP' Policy.""

He continued, ""Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!""

Soliman, 45, was booked on charges including murder in the first degree, though police have not said anyone died in the attack. He also faces felony charges for using explosives or incendiary devices, first-degree assault, and causing serious injury to the elderly, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reported that there were at least 9,354 antisemitic attacks in the U.S. in 2024, a 344 percent increase over the past five years, in a report released in April. A majority of those attacks ""contained elements related to Israel or Zionism,"" the report read.

Senior White House official Stephen Miller wrote on X that the suspect had been granted a tourist visa by the Biden administration and ""illegally overstayed that visa.""

Several people were injured in an attack at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, police said on Sunday.

The attack occurred at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall known for attracting tourists and college students, where a rally in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza was taking place.

The suspect was identified as a 45-year-old who shouted ""Free Palestine"" and used makeshift incendiary devices in the attack, said Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver field office.

The suspect was taken into custody at the scene.

On Monday, he was charged with a federal hate crime for the attack. He faces other charges including assault and the use of explosives. The US Department of Homeland Security said Monday that the man had entered the US on a tourist visa in 2022 and was in the country ""illegally.""

The FBI said Monday the suspect said he plotted the attack for a year.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals after the attack, Boulder police said.

The suspect was also injured and taken to the hospital, but authorities didn't elaborate on the nature of his injuries.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved. ""We're fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,"" he said.

""This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on Pearl Street and this act was unacceptable,"" Redfearn said at an earlier press conference. ""I ask that you join me in thinking about the victims, the families of those victims, and everyone involved in this tragedy.""

The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said on X that the attack occurred at Sunday's ""Boulder Run for Their Lives"" event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community to remember and raise visibility for the Israeli hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was ""shocked by the terrible antisemitic terror attack targeting Jews."" In a post on social media, he described it as ""antisemitism, fueled by the blood libels spread in the media."" without elaborating.

US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said he was closely monitoring the situation. ""This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism.""

The attack comes over a week after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect who shouted ""Free Palestine"" was taken into custody by police.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis posted on social media that it was ""unfathomable that the Jewish community is facing another terror attack here in Boulder.""

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations in New York also expressed outrage at the attack. ""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border — it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said in a statement.

""Today, in Boulder, Colorado, Jewish people marched with a moral and humane demand: to return the hostages.

For instance, they could have stocked the victim for some time before committing the criminal act.”

Among other charges Soliman is facing are “criminal attempt to commit class one felony,” “criminal attempt to commit class two felony” and more.

BOULDER, Colo. — A man armed with a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices launched a fiery attack on demonstrators in Colorado who were calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a “targeted terror attack.”

How did the attack unfold?

Authorities said the attacker targeted volunteers with Run for Their Lives, which organizes running and walking events to call for the immediate release of Israelis being held in Gaza. The hostages were captured by militants during an incursion into southern Israel in 2023 that precipitated the latest Israel-Hamas war.

The group gathered Sunday at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students. Witnesses said the suspect first used the flame thrower, then threw two Molotov cocktails into the crowd. Soliman was arrested at the scene.

Video from the scene shows a shirtless Soliman shouting at onlookers while holding two clear bottles containing a transparent liquid. Another video shows a witness shouting: “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.

One witness, Alex Osante, said Soliman appeared to catch himself on fire during the attack. A booking photo shows him with a bandage over one of his ears. Police said he was taken to the hospital after he was arrested but haven’t described his injuries.

What was his motive?

He told investigators “he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” that he specifically targeted the Run for Their Lives group and that he had researched and planned the attack for more than a year, according to the affidavit.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington, D.C., by a man who yelled “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza” as he was led away by police.

He is charged federally with commission of a hate crime, which carries a sentence of life in prison when the charge includes attempted murder. Colorado state charges include 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of using an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

Soliman was born in Egypt and he moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, where he lived with his wife and five children, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

The Department of Homeland Security said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and has been living in the U.S. illegally since his visa expired in February 2023.",Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a “targeted terror attack.”

Some years ago, I came upon something so stupid that it paralyzed me. It locked my brain when I tried to write about it, and I let it sit for years like a Horcrux I dare not touch. Just knowing that it was out there bothered me.

It’s the opening paragraph of a 2012 Rolling Stone article by Bill McKibben – “Global Warming’s Terrifying New Math”. It’s a remarkable artifact that I’ve come to use as a test of applied intelligence and reading ability. Only one person has ever passed, and every climate scientist I’ve tried has failed, including Gavin Schmidt and Katharine Hayhoe:

The final, bolded clause is the test. Focus on his claim – the 327th consecutive month that the temperature of the globe exceeded the 20th-century average, on which he performs some sort of probability calculation. (From now on, I’ll abbreviate the 20th-century average as the 20C average, not to be confused with the actual value, which was 13.9 °C.)

Pause here and ponder his sentence. Do you understand what he’s saying? What does he mean by his “odds” claim? Is his statement valid? Is it true? What do you need to know to evaluate it?

Take your time, come back tomorrow, or keep reading as you wish.

You might’ve noticed his error in calling 3.7 × 10⁻⁹⁹ a large number (and implicitly an integer). It’s an infinitesimal number, a fractional decimal that starts with 0.00000… That’s not the core problem, so set that aside. (Note that Rolling Stone hasn’t corrected this obvious error in 13 years.)

Focus on his core claim — the 327th consecutive month that the temperature of the globe exceeded the 20C average, on which he performs some sort of probability calculation.

Let’s clarify that his span of months covers 27¼ years, running from March, 1985 through May, 2012.

He’s saying that this span was warmer than the 20C average. Clear?

That’s odd, since of course it was. That’s what warming means. If the earth warmed throughout the 20th century, then of course the late 20th and early 21st centuries will be warmer than the 20C average, unless it cooled significantly during that period.

What about his odds statement? Well, not all strings of words are meaningful, and his is not. Before we proceed, let’s ground ourselves with this graph of global temperatures from 1901-2012.

McKibben is essentially looking at this warming trend and saying “Wow, the monthly temperatures starting in 1985 are always above the 20C average, and isn’t that incredibly fishy?” His span starts at 0.22 °C above that average (March, 1985) per the NOAA global land and ocean data.

This is about as stupid as humans get.

McKibben doesn’t provide any sources or identify the dataset he used, but they’re all similar enough for our purposes. It wasn’t the NOAA data, or his span would’ve started in 1979, adding 72 months.

NOTE: All temperatures here are Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST), a complex statistic that draws from thousands of stations and involves various corrections and weights. I’m not confident in its validity or utility as a construct, but let’s grant it for present purposes.

First, let’s note that the earth is a planet, not a sidewalk, and as such it rarely cools by more than 0.22 °C in a month. As you can see, by the late 1990s, temperatures would have to drop by at least 0.4 °C to dip below the 20C average. The graph is annual, not monthly, but it gives us the gist, and no month from 1901 to 2012 cooled by 0.4 °C or more. The average monthly change from 1901 – 2012 was 0.00071 °C of warming.

Back to his odds statement. What is this 3.7 x 10⁻⁹⁹ number? It’s a probability – which he incorrectly calls odds – and he says it’s the probability of every month in that span remaining above the 20C average “by simple chance”. That statement has no meaning, but let’s pause to figure out how he computed this.

For some reason he thinks monthly averages are important and he performed some sort of calculation regarding this string of 327 months. What calculation? It must be this:

So what was his x? Well, we need to solve an exponential equation, child’s play for the American man. We can take the log of both sides and work the steps or just invert and switch the exponent. Therefore:

When I discovered this a few years ago, I wanted to go on walkabout. We won’t have a civilization for long if this savagery is normalized. McKibben treated a planetary climate system as a monthly coin flip, such that global temperatures had even odds of landing on either side of his arbitrary baseline, even though the planet was well above that baseline at the start. If in one month the earth was, say, 0.4 °C above the 20C average, he’s saying there are even odds that the next month it would either:
• Cool by more than 0.4 °C.
• Cool by less than 0.4 °C, warm by any amount, or stay the same.

In reality, Option 2 was certain — the earth has never cooled ≥ 0.4 °C in any month from 1901 – 2012.

He took 0.5, treated it as an independent probability, and multiplied it by itself over and over — 326 times — thinking that he was computing the “odds” of every month in that 1985-2012 span remaining above the 20C average by “simple chance”.

That formulation has no meaning. There’s no such thing as “the odds of every month from 1985 to 2012 remaining above the 20C average by simple chance”. The earth is a planet — its surface temperature and energy balance are physical, empirical realities, it doesn’t randomly reset every month, and his span starts at a temperature that is already well above his arbitrary 20C baseline. The earth won’t shed such massive amounts of energy in a month.

It’s like asking for the odds that the earth remains a planet from 1985 to 2012, as opposed to turning into a dog or something, “by simple chance”. This string of words has no meaning. You could compute some probabilities of a monthly average – or a string of them – being above or below a baseline, but if you use a baseline well below normal fluctuation, and during a warming trend, you know the answer without needing to compute anything. In any case, there is no “simple chance” – it’s an empirical question that would be powered by empirical data and modeling. You can’t do anything with a calculator and a fixed, independent probability like 0.5 or any other value.

By “simple chance”, McKibben might means “if not for global warming”. But the earth did warm, he started with the earth 0.22 °C above his baseline, and again the earth is a planet, not a coin. He thinks his probability calculation is new information, that it adds to the evidence for warming and cause for alarm.

McKibben found a way to take the observed warming — the recent past that we already knew about — and turn it into a “terrifying” new development. He made the past terrifying.

That is truly remarkable and highlights the profound neuroticism, emotion dysregulation, and innumeracy that drives so much leftist climate panic. This is not a scientifically serious movement or belief system. A major media outlet published this – what might be the most savagely stupid misinformation we’ll ever see, and in thirteen years has not noticed or corrected it. It’s not just a failure of baseline intelligence, but of cognitive activation. The people at Rolling Stone are not able to read his opening paragraph and understand what he did. In fact, I’m not sure they could follow this explainer.

Similarly, partisan media outlets are not able to read fraudulent or invalid climate science consensus papers and notice that they’re fraudulent or invalid. We have a broad and deep problem with getting people to read attentively across topics, especially when they’re politicized. We’re just not getting adequate {baseline IQ + attention} focused on media articles and claims. So much nonsense is flowing into our brains — collectively, we’re not operating at a sufficient level of consciousness. It shouldn’t be possible for McKibben to have published his claim, nor for it to remain uncorrected for 13 years.

I mentioned that I use McKibben’s paragraph as a test.

In 2022, I asked two climate scientist-activists a basic question: Starting now, what’s the probability of any given month’s GMST being higher than the 20th century average?

Gavin Schmidt got the answer right straight away – 100%. He stumbled in understanding what McKibben did, saying that it was “the likelihood of the observed trend assuming no external forcing”, but no trend is needed for monthlies to not drop below the 20C average when you start 0.22 °C above it. I don’t think Schmidt realized that the period started in 1985. More fundamentally, taking an imagined probability to the 327th power does not yield the likelihood of anything, much less the likelihood of the observed trend assuming no external forcing.

I also asked Katharine Hayhoe. I never got her to understand the question. It’s an unusual question, but trivially easy if you just take a second to think about it. It takes a certain versatility and rigor to be able to reason about novel questions and step outside the scripted cognition that can dominate our daily lives.

Worse, Hayhoe didn’t seem to know the 20C average offhand or where we were relative to it. It was awkward for me to know more about basic climate science facts than a purported climate scientist – I’m a social psychologist. The red flags on Hayhoe’s website proved prescient – she very awkwardly brags about honors she’s received, including “World’s Greatest Leaders”, “100 Most Influential People”, and even wrote “In 2019 I was honoured to be named to Foreign Policy’s list of 100 Global Thinkers for the second time” (emphasis hers).

I would be so embarrassed to disclose that anyone had named me one of the “100 Most Influential People” or a “World’s Greatest Leader” – I can’t imagine putting it on my own website. I knew Hayhoe was a political partisan committed to stoking fear and hatred over mild climate change, but I hoped she would at least understand the barbarism of what McKibben did. I wanted leftists like her and Schmidt to be the voices of reason and get Rolling Stone to correct, but I couldn’t even get her to understand basic climate science.

In any case, the full test is to present McKibben’s opening paragraph, highlighting the clause about the 327 months, and see if people can identify the problem. They’ll need to solve for his x and know the basic background fact that the earth warmed over the course of the 20th century. It will help if they have a sense of how much the earth warmed and what monthly fluctuation looks like. It’s a fascinating test because it requires a level of attention and exogenous intelligence that people rarely apply to what they read[1]. Try it.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old foreign national, entered the U.S. during the Biden administration and remained in the country after his visa expired, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation. Soliman is accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a pro-Israel demonstration.

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” a DHS spokesperson stated Monday to the DCNF. “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.”

On Sunday afternoon, Soliman allegedly targeted peaceful demonstrators advocating for the Israeli hostages who remain in Hamas custody, according to a press release from City of Boulder. The attack left eight victims — four women and four men ages 52 to 88 — requiring medical attention at Denver metro hospitals.

Soliman allegedly yelled “free Palestine” during his attack against demonstrators, according to police. After being taken to the hospital for a medical evaluation, he was booked into the Boulder County Jail on multiple charges.

Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, also confirmed Soliman’s immigration status in a statement on social media, and called for “suicide migration” to be undone.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien. He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit,” Miller posted on X Sunday. “Suicidal migration must be fully reversed.”

The attack in Boulder came less than two weeks after two Israeli embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were fatally gunned down in Washington, D.C. Their alleged killer, 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez, opened fire on a group of people as they exited the Capital Jewish Museum and later shouted “free Palestine” as he was being detained.

The Israel-Hamas war began when the terrorist group launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, murdering around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping roughly 250 others. Israel Defense Forces have since largely occupied Gaza and eliminated thousands of Hamas operatives, crippling the terrorist organization’s capabilities, but at a great humanitarian cost to the Arab enclave.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy sadly and I know a lot of people are scared right now and questioning how this happened and why,” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said in a prepared statement Sunday. “Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover.

“I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive,” Redfearn continued.

(AP) — A man posing as a gardener to get close to a group in Boulder holding their weekly demonstration for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza planned to kill them all with Molotov cocktails, authorities said Monday.

But he had second thoughts and only threw two out of the 18 incendiary devices he had into the group of about 20 people, yelling “Free Palestine” and accidentally burning himself, police said. Twelve people were injured in the Sunday attack. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn’t spray it on anyone but himself “because he had planned on dying.”

“He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” police wrote in an affidavit. He didn’t carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before.”

Mohamad Sabry Soliman, 45, planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime. The suspect’s first name also was spelled Mohammed in some court documents.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado said during a press conference Monday.

Federal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment.

During a state court hearing Monday, Soliman appeared briefly via a video link from the Boulder County Jail wearing an orange jumpsuit. Another court hearing is set for Thursday. Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after the hearing.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

The victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88, and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. All four of the latest victims had what police described as minor injuries.

Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.

The volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration when video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails."" A police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Witness Alex Osante of San Diego said he was across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking and a “boom” followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.

Soliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, police wrote.

Osante said that after the suspect threw the two incendiary devices, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw the second, he took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.

District Attorney Michael Dougherty said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were recovered by law enforcement. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said.

Soliman told investigators he constructed the devices after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Soliman also told investigators he took a concealed carry class and tried to buy a gun but was denied because he is not a legal U.S. citizen.

Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

In video and photos shot right after the attack by a woman at the gathering, Soliman can be seen pacing without his shirt on with what appears to be burns down one of his arms. He and a small group of people around him are screaming at each other, with some witnesses filming him.

Soliman, who was born in Egypt, moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five kids, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his wife as kindly neighbors with three young kids and two teenagers who’d play with Pruiett’s kids.

Another neighbor, Kierra Johnson, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman’s home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.

In video and photos shot right after the attack by a woman at the gathering, Soliman can be seen pacing without his shirt on with what appears to be burns down one of his arms. He and a small group of people around him are screaming at each other, with some witnesses filming him.

Soliman, who was born in Egypt, moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five kids, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his wife as kindly neighbors with three young kids and two teenagers who’d play with Pruiett’s kids.

Another neighbor, Kierra Johnson, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman’s home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.

(AP) — A man posing as a gardener to get close to a group in Boulder holding their weekly demonstration for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza planned to kill them all with Molotov cocktails, authorities said Monday.

But he had second thoughts and only threw two out of the 18 incendiary devices he had into the group of about 20 people, yelling “Free Palestine” and accidentally burning himself, police said. Twelve people were injured in the Sunday attack. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn’t spray it on anyone but himself “because he had planned on dying.”

“He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” police wrote in an affidavit. He didn’t carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before.”

Mohamad Sabry Soliman, 45, planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime. The suspect’s first name also was spelled Mohammed in some court documents.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado said during a press conference Monday.

Federal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment.

During a state court hearing Monday, Soliman appeared briefly via a video link from the Boulder County Jail wearing an orange jumpsuit. Another court hearing is set for Thursday. Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after the hearing.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

The victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88, and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. All four of the latest victims had what police described as minor injuries.

Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.

The volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration when video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails."" A police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Witness Alex Osante of San Diego said he was across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking and a “boom” followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.

Soliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, police wrote.

Osante said that after the suspect threw the two incendiary devices, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw the second, he took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.

District Attorney Michael Dougherty said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were recovered by law enforcement. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said.

Soliman told investigators he constructed the devices after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Soliman also told investigators he took a concealed carry class and tried to buy a gun but was denied because he is not a legal U.S. citizen.

Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

A Holocaust survivor is among the victims of the attack in Colorado - as a man has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder following an attack on a rally for Israeli hostages.

Eight people aged between 52 and 88 - including a Holocaust survivor - were injured in the attack.

The 88-year-old was injured along with her daughter, according to a community leader.

Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said the mother had been ""through enough trauma"".

Funk told CNN she had spoken to several victims of the attack - including one who had suffered ""horrible burns"".

No deaths have been reported.

Ms Funk said: “This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war.

“These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

The man reportedly shouted ""Free Palestine"" in Boulder, Colorado, as he launched the attack at the rally, police said.

Eyewitnesses said the suspect lobbed Molotov cocktails, a homemade bomb constructed out of a bottle filled with petrol and stuffed with a piece of cloth to use as a fuse, into people attending the protest.

Soliman has also received one charge for ""extreme indifference"". Another relates to ""deliberation with intent — nonfamily — gun.""

He is also charged with one count of attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, and one count of causing serious injury to an at-risk adult or someone over 70 and one count of using explosives or incendiary devices.

The FBI described the incident, which took place at Boulder Country Historic Courthouse, as a “targeted terror attack”.

Footage on social media shows a shirtless man holding bottles with cloth and clear liquid inside. Videos also show the man being detained at the scene.

Soliman is understood to be an Egyptian national who seemingly acted alone. Authorities said he has no previous significant contact with law enforcement.

Dan Bongino, a deputy director at the FBI, said: ""We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence.

Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called the incident ""pure anti-semitism"" on social media, adding that the attack is ""terrorism"" and demanding ""concrete action"".

He said: ""Jewish protesters were brutally attacked. Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border - it is already burning the streets of America.""

“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,"" Colorado's Attorney General Phil Weiser said.

The group of people attacked were said to be peacefully demonstrating to show solidarity for Israeli hostages in Gaza, organised by a group called 'Run for Their Lives'.

Weiser continued: “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences.""

The suspect in the Boulder firebomb attack had reportedly worked at the Veros Health medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado.

He had also spent six months working at the independent physicians practice from early 2024 - sources told CBS News.

It's unclear what his role was at the clinic.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old foreign national, entered the U.S. during the Biden administration and remained in the country after his visa expired, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation. Soliman is accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a pro-Israel demonstration.

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” a DHS spokesperson stated Monday to the DCNF. “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.”

On Sunday afternoon, Soliman allegedly targeted peaceful demonstrators advocating for the Israeli hostages who remain in Hamas custody, according to a press release from City of Boulder. The attack left eight victims — four women and four men ages 52 to 88 — requiring medical attention at Denver metro hospitals.

Soliman allegedly yelled “free Palestine” during his attack against demonstrators, according to police. After being taken to the hospital for a medical evaluation, he was booked into the Boulder County Jail on multiple charges.

Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, also confirmed Soliman’s immigration status in a statement on social media, and called for “suicide migration” to be undone. (RELATED: Everything You Need To Know About The ‘Illegal’ Biden-Era Migrant Parole Program Trump’s Itching To Kill)

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien. He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit,” Miller posted on X Sunday. “Suicidal migration must be fully reversed.”

The attack in Boulder came less than two weeks after two Israeli embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were fatally gunned down in Washington, D.C. Their alleged killer, 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez, opened fire on a group of people as they exited the Capital Jewish Museum and later shouted “free Palestine” as he was being detained.

The Israel-Hamas war began when the terrorist group launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, murdering around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping roughly 250 others. Israel Defense Forces have since largely occupied Gaza and eliminated thousands of Hamas operatives, crippling the terrorist organization’s capabilities, but at a great humanitarian cost to the Arab enclave.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy sadly and I know a lot of people are scared right now and questioning how this happened and why,” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said in a prepared statement Sunday. “Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover.

“I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive,” Redfearn continued.

The free event will bring researchers to the community to educate people on cancer and healthy aging.

Jan Lowery, PhD, with the University of Colorado Cancer Center, joined FOX21 Morning News on Monday, June 2, to talk about who should consider attending and why this research is important.

Lowery said the purpose of the research roadshows is to connect researchers with the community. “Researchers get to come and talk about the research that they’re doing, engage the community members, and even potentially enroll people in their studies,” said Lowery. “And community members get to come and learn about the research that we’re doing, why it’s important for them to participate, and have the opportunity to enroll in studies on the spot.”

During this roadshow, participants can learn about a research study looking into the impacts of heavy metals found in Pueblo, as well as another study looking at interventions for fatigue in cancer survivors.

The event is Friday, June 13, at Pueblo Community College from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Lowery said most of the studies are targeted for adults 50 and older, but all are welcome to attend. Preregistration is requested but not required.

The state of Colorado has charged the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, with 42 counts, including eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation and eight counts of first-degree murder with extreme indifference. He was charged earlier Monday with a federal hate crime.

According to an FBI affidavit released Monday, Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian national, shouted “free Palestine” and threw “two lit Molotov cocktails at individuals” participating in a weekly Run for Their Lives event around 2 p.m. local time at Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall. The weekly event’s purpose is to demand the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and during Israel’s ongoing, retaliatory bombing campaign.

Eight people were hospitalized with burns and other injuries from the attack, with two of them in serious condition, officials said Sunday. Officials on Monday afternoon said they had identified four additional victims, bringing the total number of those injured in the attack to 12.

Soliman has been charged with a single federal hate crime offense, “involving actual or perceived race, religion or national origin.” He is expected to face additional charges.

After Soliman was detained, law enforcement officials found a nearby plastic container with “fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails,” the FBI stated in its arrest warrant application. While in custody, Soliman “stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead. [Soliman] stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again.”

He specifically targeted the ‘Zionist Group’ that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search. SOLIMAN knew that they planned to meet today, Sunday, June 1 at 1pm. He arrived at approximately 12:55 p.m. and waited for them. Throughout the interview, SOLIMAN stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over ‘our land,’ which he explained to be Palestine. He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.

Soliman entered the U.S. in August 2022 on B2 visa (a temporary visitor visa for non-business–related activities) that expired in February 2023, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” she said in a post on X. “He filed for asylum in September 2022.”

“McLaughlin told NBC News the suspect’s asylum claim was pending,” the outlet reported. “While his visa had expired, he had not yet exhausted all legal routes to staying in the U.S.”

The attack occurred less than two weeks after a shooter killed two Israeli embassy staffers outside the Capitol Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and subsequently shouted “free Palestine!”

(AP) — The man who authorities say firebombed a group in Boulder, Colorado, demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages, has been charged in state court with over 100 counts, including attempted murder and assault.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, an Egyptian national who federal authorities say was living in the U.S. illegally, has also been charged with a hate crime in federal court and is jailed on a $10 million cash bond.

Authorities say Soliman yelled “Free Palestine"" and threw two of 18 Molotov cocktails he was carrying. Officials said he expressed no regrets about the attack, which came after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington on May 21.

The Israel-Hamas war has contributed to a spike in antisemitism in the U.S. It began in October 2023 when Hamas militants in Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage.

What’s next for the suspect and his family?

Soliman was charged with 118 counts in a Colorado court Thursday.

His attorney, Kathryn Herold, waived a formal reading of the charges and a preliminary hearing was set for July 15 to determine whether the state has enough evidence to move forward.

The attempted murder charges alone could result in Soliman being sentenced to as many as 672 years if convicted, said Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney.

Soliman entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, according to Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. Soliman filed for asylum and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that also expired.

He, his wife and children were living in Colorado Springs. A federal judge issued an order Wednesday to halt the deportation of Soliman’s wife and children, who were taken into custody Tuesday by U.S. immigration officials. The family members, all Egyptian citizens, have not been charged in the attack. They were being held at an immigration detention center in Texas, said Eric Lee, an attorney representing the family.

Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew about his attack plan, according to court documents. Authorities are investigating whether that’s true.

In response to the attack, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Wednesday that federal authorities will crack down on people who overstay their visas.

What was the possible motive behind the attack?

Soliman told police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” referring to the movement to establish and sustain a Jewish state in Israel. The attack on the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder targeted what Soliman described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime.

That charge carries a sentence of life in prison when it includes attempted murder.

Who are the demonstrators?

The people hurt in the attack are demonstrators with Run for Their Lives, a global grassroots initiative that started in October 2023 after Hamas' attack in Israel. Through weekly walks, the group’s 230 chapters seek to raise awareness of the 58 people believed to still be in captivity in Gaza, said Shira Weiss, the organization’s global coordinator.

Authorities have said 15 people and a dog were victims of the attack. But not all of them were physically injured, with some being considered victims for the legal case because they were in the area and could have been hurt. The dog was among the injured, Dougherty said.

The victims include eight women and seven men, range in age from 25 to 88, and their injuries range from serious to minor.

(AP) — The man who authorities say firebombed a group in Boulder, Colorado, demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages, has been charged in state court with over 100 counts, including attempted murder and assault.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, an Egyptian national who federal authorities say was living in the U.S. illegally, has also been charged with a hate crime in federal court and is jailed on a $10 million cash bond.

Authorities say Soliman yelled “Free Palestine"" and threw two of 18 Molotov cocktails he was carrying. Officials said he expressed no regrets about the attack, which came after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington on May 21.

The Israel-Hamas war has contributed to a spike in antisemitism in the U.S. It began in October 2023 when Hamas militants in Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage.

What’s next for the suspect and his family?

Soliman was charged with 118 counts in a Colorado court Thursday.

His attorney, Kathryn Herold, waived a formal reading of the charges and a preliminary hearing was set for July 15 to determine whether the state has enough evidence to move forward.

The attempted murder charges alone could result in Soliman being sentenced to as many as 672 years if convicted, said Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney.

Soliman entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, according to Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. Soliman filed for asylum and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that also expired.

(AP) — A man posing as a gardener to get close to a group in Boulder holding their weekly demonstration for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza planned to kill them all with Molotov cocktails, authorities said Monday.

But he had second thoughts and only threw two out of the 18 incendiary devices he had into the group of about 20 people, yelling “Free Palestine” and accidentally burning himself, police said. Twelve people were injured in the Sunday attack. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn’t spray it on anyone but himself “because he had planned on dying.”

“He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” police wrote in an affidavit. He didn’t carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before.”

Mohamad Sabry Soliman, 45, planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime. The suspect’s first name also was spelled Mohammed in some court documents.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Acting U.S. Attorney J. Bishop Grewell for the District of Colorado said during a press conference Monday.

Federal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment.

During a state court hearing Monday, Soliman appeared briefly via a video link from the Boulder County Jail wearing an orange jumpsuit. Another court hearing is set for Thursday. Soliman is being held on a $10 million, cash-only bond, prosecutors said.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Soliman’s attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after the hearing.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

The victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88, and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. All four of the latest victims had what police described as minor injuries.

Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.

The volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration when video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails.” A police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Witness Alex Osante of San Diego said he was across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking and a “boom” followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.

Soliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, police wrote.

Osante said that after the suspect threw the two incendiary devices, apparently catching himself on fire as he threw the second, he took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.

District Attorney Michael Dougherty said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were recovered by law enforcement. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said.

Soliman told investigators he constructed the devices after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Soliman also told investigators he took a concealed carry class and tried to buy a gun but was denied because he is not a legal U.S. citizen.

Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

In video and photos shot right after the attack by a woman at the gathering, Soliman can be seen pacing without his shirt on with what appears to be burns down one of his arms. He and a small group of people around him are screaming at each other, with some witnesses filming him.

Soliman, who was born in Egypt, moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five kids, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his wife as kindly neighbors with three young kids and two teenagers who’d play with Pruiett’s kids.

Another neighbor, Kierra Johnson, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman’s home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.

According to El Paso County Public Health, a third case of measles was confirmed in a vaccinated El Paso County resident who traveled through Denver International Airport (DIA) on Wednesday, May 14.

A new exposure site has also been added:

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) and the El Paso County Public Health (EPCPH) have confirmed two measles cases in El Paso County.

Two unvaccinated adults have been confirmed to have measles. The adults are unrelated, but were at Denver International Airport around the same time on Wednesday, May 14. Another individual from Arapahoe County who was a passenger on a Turkish Airlines flight that arrived in Denver on May 13 has also been confirmed positive for measles.

The two unvaccinated adults from El Paso and the vaccinated adult from Arapahoe County are all recovering at home.

The CDPHE said that based on information, anyone who was in the following locations during the dates and times may have been exposed to measles:

Those who believe they have been exposed to measles should monitor symptoms for 21 days after exposure and consider avoiding public gatherings or high-risk settings.

“Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself, your family, and your community. Measles is highly contagious and can sometimes lead to serious health problems, but it is a vaccine-preventable disease,” the CDPHE wrote. “Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a characteristic rash that usually starts several days later on the face and spreads. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine provides strong protection.”

Monitoring is important, especially for people who have not been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, which, if given within 72 hours of infection, can prevent infection.

Colorado’s total number of cases is up to six.

The state of Colorado has charged the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, with 42 counts, including eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation and eight counts of first-degree murder with extreme indifference. He was charged earlier Monday with a federal hate crime.

According to an FBI affidavit released Monday, Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian national, shouted “free Palestine” and threw “two lit Molotov cocktails at individuals” participating in a weekly Run for Their Lives event around 2 p.m. local time at Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall. The weekly event’s purpose is to demand the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and during Israel’s ongoing, retaliatory bombing campaign.

Eight people were hospitalized with burns and other injuries from the attack, with two of them in serious condition, officials said Sunday. Officials on Monday afternoon said they had identified four additional victims, bringing the total number of those injured in the attack to 12.

Soliman has been charged with a single federal hate crime offense, “involving actual or perceived race, religion or national origin.” He is expected to face additional charges.

After Soliman was detained, law enforcement officials found a nearby plastic container with “fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails,” the FBI stated in its arrest warrant application. While in custody, Soliman “stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead. [Soliman] stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again.”

He specifically targeted the ‘Zionist Group’ that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search. SOLIMAN knew that they planned to meet today, Sunday, June 1 at 1pm. He arrived at approximately 12:55 p.m. and waited for them. Throughout the interview, SOLIMAN stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over ‘our land,’ which he explained to be Palestine. He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.

Soliman entered the U.S. in August 2022 on B2 visa (a temporary visitor visa for non-business–related activities) that expired in February 2023, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” she said in a post on X. “He filed for asylum in September 2022.”

“McLaughlin told NBC News the suspect’s asylum claim was pending,” the outlet reported. “While his visa had expired, he had not yet exhausted all legal routes to staying in the U.S.”

The attack occurred less than two weeks after a shooter killed two Israeli embassy staffers outside the Capitol Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and subsequently shouted “free Palestine!”

The state of Colorado has charged the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, with 42 counts, including eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation and eight counts of first-degree murder with extreme indifference. He was charged earlier Monday with a federal hate crime.

According to an FBI affidavit released Monday, Soliman, a 45-year-old Egyptian national, shouted “free Palestine” and threw “two lit Molotov cocktails at individuals” participating in a weekly Run for Their Lives event around 2 p.m. local time at Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall. The weekly event’s purpose is to demand the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and during Israel’s ongoing, retaliatory bombing campaign.

Eight people were hospitalized with burns and other injuries from the attack, with two of them in serious condition, officials said Sunday. Officials on Monday afternoon said they had identified four additional victims, bringing the total number of those injured in the attack to 12.

Soliman has been charged with a single federal hate crime offense, “involving actual or perceived race, religion or national origin.” He is expected to face additional charges.

After Soliman was detained, law enforcement officials found a nearby plastic container with “fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails,” the FBI stated in its arrest warrant application. While in custody, Soliman “stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead. [Soliman] stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again.”

He specifically targeted the ‘Zionist Group’ that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search. SOLIMAN knew that they planned to meet today, Sunday, June 1 at 1pm. He arrived at approximately 12:55 p.m. and waited for them. Throughout the interview, SOLIMAN stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over ‘our land,’ which he explained to be Palestine. He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.

Soliman entered the U.S. in August 2022 on B2 visa (a temporary visitor visa for non-business–related activities) that expired in February 2023, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” she said in a post on X. “He filed for asylum in September 2022.”

“McLaughlin told NBC News the suspect’s asylum claim was pending,” the outlet reported. “While his visa had expired, he had not yet exhausted all legal routes to staying in the U.S.”

The attack occurred less than two weeks after a shooter killed two Israeli embassy staffers outside the Capitol Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., and subsequently shouted “free Palestine!”

(AP) — The man who authorities say firebombed a group in Boulder, Colorado, demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages, has been charged in state court with over 100 counts, including attempted murder and assault.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, an Egyptian national who federal authorities say was living in the U.S. illegally, has also been charged with a hate crime in federal court and is jailed on a $10 million cash bond.

Authorities say Soliman yelled “Free Palestine"" and threw two of 18 Molotov cocktails he was carrying. Officials said he expressed no regrets about the attack, which came after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington on May 21.

The Israel-Hamas war has contributed to a spike in antisemitism in the U.S. It began in October 2023 when Hamas militants in Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage.

What’s next for the suspect and his family?

Soliman was charged with 118 counts in a Colorado court Thursday.

His attorney, Kathryn Herold, waived a formal reading of the charges and a preliminary hearing was set for July 15 to determine whether the state has enough evidence to move forward.

The attempted murder charges alone could result in Soliman being sentenced to as many as 672 years if convicted, said Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney.

Soliman entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, according to Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. Soliman filed for asylum and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that also expired.

He, his wife and children were living in Colorado Springs. A federal judge issued an order Wednesday to halt the deportation of Soliman’s wife and children, who were taken into custody Tuesday by U.S. immigration officials. The family members, all Egyptian citizens, have not been charged in the attack. They were being held at an immigration detention center in Texas, said Eric Lee, an attorney representing the family.

Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew about his attack plan, according to court documents. Authorities are investigating whether that’s true.

In response to the attack, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Wednesday that federal authorities will crack down on people who overstay their visas.

What was the possible motive behind the attack?

Soliman told police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” referring to the movement to establish and sustain a Jewish state in Israel. The attack on the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder targeted what Soliman described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime.

That charge carries a sentence of life in prison when it includes attempted murder.

Who are the demonstrators?

The people hurt in the attack are demonstrators with Run for Their Lives, a global grassroots initiative that started in October 2023 after Hamas' attack in Israel. Through weekly walks, the group’s 230 chapters seek to raise awareness of the 58 people believed to still be in captivity in Gaza, said Shira Weiss, the organization’s global coordinator.

Authorities have said 15 people and a dog were victims of the attack. But not all of them were physically injured, with some being considered victims for the legal case because they were in the area and could have been hurt. The dog was among the injured, Dougherty said.

The victims include eight women and seven men, range in age from 25 to 88, and their injuries range from serious to minor.

The newly-released mugshot showsSoliman with a burned and bandaged face. Sharing the mugshot on X, police confirmed that “no victims have died.” They also noted, “The suspect’s mugshot is seen here and his date of birth is Dec. 15, 1979.”

‘I'm just waiting for the ""he was on our radar"" statement to come out’

Netizens took to the comment section to react to the incident, with many raising various questions. “How long did it take from the first 911 call to the officers on scene? Why aren’t officers patrolling Pearl street constantly?” one user asked. “Quick question — what time does @RealTomHoman’s @DHSgov team pick this guy up? Boulder deserves better than silence and virtue signals after a terrorist attack on peaceful demonstrators — and a catch-and-release culture that’s become the norm under our DA,” another wrote. One said, “I'm just waiting for the ""he was on our radar"" statement to come out.”

“Any idea of a motive yet?” one user questioned, while another said, “If only the citizens of Boulder had a way to protect themselves.” One said, “If you try to claim that the motive is elusive, you should be thrown into jail.” Another wrote, “Unreal”.

Authorities have confirmed that Soliman was in the United States illegallyafter overstaying his visa. Homeland Security officials told Fox News that he originally entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport on August 27, 2022. Soliman was reportedly also injured in the attack, and was brought to a nearby hospital to be examined.","The Boulder Police Department has released a mugshot of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the man who allegedly carried out an attack on a group of people in Colorado."

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, took concealed carry classes and learned to shoot as he planned the attack, only switching to Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower after he could not buy a gun because of his immigration status, county investigators said in an arrest affidavit.

Police identified four additional victims in the attack on Monday, bringing the total to 12, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said during an afternoon briefing. The four additional victims had minor injuries, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said. The eight victims announced Sunday were all burned, and two of them remained in the hospital Monday. Officials could not say whether any of the victims were bystanders.

Soliman, an Egyptian citizen living in Colorado illegally, was charged with a federal hate crime in Sunday’s attack, according to an FBI arrest affidavit. The U.S. Department of Justice characterized the weekend incident as an “antisemitic terror attack.”

If convicted, Soliman could spend up to life in prison, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado J. Bishop Grewell said Monday afternoon. When asked about possible terrorism charges, Grewell said his office may file additional charges in the case.

Soliman was also arrested on suspicion of 42 state felony charges, according to the Boulder County arrest affidavit. The state charges under investigation include:
• Eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation,
• Eight counts of attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference,
• Six counts of first-degree assault of an at-risk or elderly victim,
• Two counts of possession of an incendiary device,
• And 16 counts of attempted possession of an incendiary device.

He faces up to 624 years in prison if convicted on all counts.

Soliman made his first court appearance virtually from the Boulder County Jail on Monday afternoon, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a bandage around his head covering both ears. Judge Nancy W. Salomone advised that he should have no contact with any of the victims under a protection order and did not change his $10 million bail.

The jail was on lockdown and inmates could not leave their cells during the hearing, which allowed deputies to monitor the courtroom and the jail’s entrance, Boulder County Sheriff’s Public Information Officer Vinnie Montez said. At least three snipers were also stationed on the roof of the jail.

Boulder County prosecutors will file additional charges later this week for the four victims identified Monday, Dougherty said. Boulder police had not encountered Soliman before Sunday and he was not on the FBI’s radar, Redfearn and Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek said.

“We stand united in denouncing hate, terror and violence in this community,” Dougherty said Monday afternoon. “We stand united in condemning acts of antisemitism, hate and violence, and we’re also united in a strong response to this horrific attack.”

Soliman drove from Castle Rock to the Pearl Street Mall armed with 18 Molotov cocktails and a backpack weed sprayer filled with gasoline that he planned to use to kill a group of demonstrators before killing himself, according to court records.

The attack happened just before the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which began at sundown on Sunday.

The 45-year-old told investigators that he waited for a year to attack the “Zionist group” because he wanted his daughter to graduate from high school first, according to his arrest affidavit.

The group, Run for Their Lives, is part of a national movement calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The Boulder chapter hosts a weekly walk on the Pearl Street Mall, scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday, when Soliman attacked them outside the courthouse.

Soliman told investigators the attack was revenge because the demonstrators did not care about Palestinian hostages and supported the deaths of Palestinians, according to an affidavit.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Grewell said at the Monday afternoon briefing.

Soliman arrived at 12:55 p.m. and waited for demonstrators to reach him. He was dressed like a gardener and carried flowers he bought from Home Depot in an effort to get as close to the group as possible, investigators wrote.

Soliman threw two of the Molotov cocktails and police recovered another 16 at the scene, Dougherty said. They were made with glass wine carafes and canning jars filled with gasoline that had red rags hanging out.

“Mohamed said he only threw two at the group because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” federal investigators wrote in an affidavit. “He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it.”

Soliman didn’t expect to survive the attack and sprayed himself with gasoline so that he would burn alongside his victims, police said in his arrest affidavits.

Investigators also found rags, a red gas container and paperwork with the words “Israel,” “Palestine” and “USAID” inside Soliman’s Toyota Prius, which was parked behind a church at 13th and Spruce streets, investigators wrote.

Who is the suspect?

Federal officials said Soliman was born in Egypt and lived in Kuwait for 17 years before he moved to the Colorado Springs area with his wife and five children.

He arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 and was in the country illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, federal immigration officials said. He applied for asylum in September 2022, but federal officials did not disclose any other details about his asylum case on Monday.

Soliman lived with his family in a modest townhome on a cul-de-sac east of Colorado Springs. No one answered the door on Monday morning, but officials said the family cooperated with a search warrant.

A Spider-Man bicycle with training wheels was parked on the sidewalk, and several other tricycles and toys were stacked near the front door.

Neighbors said multiple children, ranging in age from toddlers to teenagers, lived in the home with Soliman. An adult woman also lived there, multiple neighbors said.

The children often played outside in front of the row of townhouses, where gravel covers the yard. Most of the homes in the area are rentals.

The neighbors who spoke to The Denver Post declined to give their names, saying they did not want to be associated with the attack in any way. They said they only knew the family casually, just waving and saying hello if they saw each other outside.

Shameka Pruiett told the Associated Press that she knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbors with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who’d play with Pruiett’s kids in front of their building, share food and hellos.

But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognize him.

“There had to be something deeply disturbing him, cause that is not the guy we see in the neighborhood,” said Pruiett.

An online resume under Soliman’s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.

Police identified four additional victims in the attack on Monday, bringing the total to 12, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said during an afternoon briefing. The four additional victims had minor injuries, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said. The eight victims announced Sunday were all burned, and two of them remained in the hospital Monday. Officials could not say whether any of the victims were bystanders.

Soliman, an Egyptian citizen living in Colorado illegally, was charged with a federal hate crime in Sunday’s attack, according to an FBI arrest affidavit. The U.S. Department of Justice characterized the weekend incident as an “antisemitic terror attack.”

If convicted, Soliman could spend up to life in prison, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado J. Bishop Grewell said Monday afternoon. When asked about possible terrorism charges, Grewell said his office may file additional charges in the case.

Soliman was also arrested on suspicion of 42 state felony charges, according to the Boulder County arrest affidavit. The state charges under investigation include:
• Eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation,
• Eight counts of attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference,
• Six counts of first-degree assault of an at-risk or elderly victim,
• Two counts of possession of an incendiary device,
• And 16 counts of attempted possession of an incendiary device.

He faces up to 624 years in prison if convicted on all counts.

Soliman made his first court appearance virtually from the Boulder County Jail on Monday afternoon, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a bandage around his head covering both ears. Judge Nancy W. Salomone advised that he should have no contact with any of the victims under a protection order and did not change his $10 million bail.

The jail was on lockdown and inmates could not leave their cells during the hearing, which allowed deputies to monitor the courtroom and the jail’s entrance, Boulder County Sheriff’s Public Information Officer Vinnie Montez said. At least three snipers were also stationed on the roof of the jail.

Boulder County prosecutors will file additional charges later this week for the four victims identified Monday, Dougherty said. Boulder police had not encountered Soliman before Sunday and he was not on the FBI’s radar, Redfearn and Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek said.

“We stand united in denouncing hate, terror and violence in this community,” Dougherty said Monday afternoon. “We stand united in condemning acts of antisemitism, hate and violence, and we’re also united in a strong response to this horrific attack.”

Soliman drove from Castle Rock to the Pearl Street Mall armed with 18 Molotov cocktails and a backpack weed sprayer filled with gasoline that he planned to use to kill a group of demonstrators before killing himself, according to court records.

The attack happened just before the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which began at sundown on Sunday.

The 45-year-old told investigators that he waited for a year to attack the “Zionist group” because he wanted his daughter to graduate from high school first, according to his arrest affidavit.

The group, Run for Their Lives, is part of a national movement calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The Boulder chapter hosts a weekly walk on the Pearl Street Mall, scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday, when Soliman attacked them outside the courthouse.

Soliman told investigators the attack was revenge because the demonstrators did not care about Palestinian hostages and supported the deaths of Palestinians, according to an affidavit.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Grewell said at the Monday afternoon briefing.

Soliman arrived at 12:55 p.m. and waited for demonstrators to reach him. He was dressed like a gardener and carried flowers he bought from Home Depot in an effort to get as close to the group as possible, investigators wrote.

Soliman threw two of the Molotov cocktails and police recovered another 16 at the scene, Dougherty said. They were made with glass wine carafes and canning jars filled with gasoline that had red rags hanging out.

“Mohamed said he only threw two at the group because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” federal investigators wrote in an affidavit. “He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it.”

Soliman didn’t expect to survive the attack and sprayed himself with gasoline so that he would burn alongside his victims, police said in his arrest affidavits.

Investigators also found rags, a red gas container and paperwork with the words “Israel,” “Palestine” and “USAID” inside Soliman’s Toyota Prius, which was parked behind a church at 13th and Spruce streets, investigators wrote.

Who is the suspect?

Federal officials said Soliman was born in Egypt and lived in Kuwait for 17 years before he moved to the Colorado Springs area with his wife and five children.

He arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 and was in the country illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, federal immigration officials said. He applied for asylum in September 2022, but federal officials did not disclose any other details about his asylum case on Monday.

Soliman lived with his family in a modest townhome on a cul-de-sac east of Colorado Springs. No one answered the door on Monday morning, but officials said the family cooperated with a search warrant.

A Spider-Man bicycle with training wheels was parked on the sidewalk, and several other tricycles and toys were stacked near the front door.

Neighbors said multiple children, ranging in age from toddlers to teenagers, lived in the home with Soliman. An adult woman also lived there, multiple neighbors said.

The children often played outside in front of the row of townhouses, where gravel covers the yard. Most of the homes in the area are rentals.

The neighbors who spoke to The Denver Post declined to give their names, saying they did not want to be associated with the attack in any way. They said they only knew the family casually, just waving and saying hello if they saw each other outside.

Shameka Pruiett told the Associated Press that she knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbors with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who’d play with Pruiett’s kids in front of their building, share food and hellos.

But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognize him.

“There had to be something deeply disturbing him, cause that is not the guy we see in the neighborhood,” said Pruiett.

An online resume under Soliman’s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.

BOULDER, Colo. — A man armed with a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices launched a fiery attack on demonstrators in Colorado who were calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a “targeted terror attack.”

The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled “Free Palestine” durig the attack Sunday, according to Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. Authorities believe Soliman acted alone.

He faces multiple federal and state charges, including commission of a hate crime.

How did the attack unfold

Authorities said the attacker targeted volunteers with Run for Their Lives, which organizes running and walking events to call for the immediate release of Israelis being held in Gaza. The hostages were captured by militants during an incursion into southern Israel in 2023 that precipitated the latest Israel-Hamas war.

The group gathered Sunday at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students. Witnesses said the suspect first used the flame thrower, then threw two Molotov cocktails into the crowd. Soliman was arrested at the scene.

Video from the scene shows a shirtless Soliman shouting at onlookers while holding two clear bottles containing a transparent liquid. Another video shows a witness shouting: “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.

One witness, Alex Osante, said Soliman appeared to catch himself on fire during the attack. A booking photo shows him with a bandage over one of his ears. Police said he was taken to the hospital after he was arrested but haven’t described his injuries.

What was his motive?

Witnesses said Soliman yelled “Free Palestine” as he launched the attack. An FBI affidavit said he confessed to the attack.

He told investigators “he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” that he specifically targeted the Run for Their Lives group and that he had researched and planned the attack for more than a year, according to the affidavit.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington, D.C., by a man who yelled “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza” as he was led away by police.

Soliman is charged federally with commission of a hate crime, which carries a sentence of life in prison when the charge includes attempted murder. Colorado state charges include 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of using an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

Additional charges are possible in federal court. The Justice Department plans to seek a grand jury indictment.

Soliman was born in Egypt and he moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, where he lived with his wife and five children, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

The Department of Homeland Security said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and has been living in the U.S. illegally since his visa expired in February 2023.

Soliman worked as an Uber driver and had passed the company’s eligibility requirements, which include a criminal background check, according to a spokesperson for Uber.

An online resume under Suliman’s name says he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Soliman listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo, on the resume.

The people injured in the Pearl Street attack range in age from 52 to 88. Their injuries — some serious and some minor — were consistent with reports of people being set on fire, Redfearn said.

Authorities initially said there were eight victims, but said four others later were identified.

Photos from the scene showed a burning woman lying on the ground in a fetal position and a man helping to put out the flames using a jug of water.

“The immense wave of positive messages we’ve received is another signal of the health and strong spirits of our community,” Rabbi Yisroel and Leah Wilhelm, directors of the Rohr Chabad House at the University of Colorado said in a statement. “We encourage everyone to respond energetically to this attack by celebrating Shavuot joyously, by attending the reading of the Ten Commandments, and by recommitting to the heritage and traditions we hold so dear.""","Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower."

In a post on Truth Social, Trump seized on the attack’s implications for immigration policy after a Department of Homeland Security official wrote in a social media post Monday morning the suspect in the attack had overstayed his visa and was in the country illegally.

“He came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under ‘TRUMP’ Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law,” Trump wrote. “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terror, with local authorities identifying the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs. Soliman, who was encountered on the scene, is in custody and has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to an FBI affidavit.

According to the affidavit, Soliman said in an interview with federal and local law enforcement that he “wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead” and that he had been planning the attack for a year.

J. Bishop Grewell, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Colorado, said in a press conference on Monday that when Soliman was interviewed about the attack, he told authorities, “he wanted them all to die. He had no regrets and he would go back and do it again.”



“No one should ever be subjected to violence of any kind,” Grewell said. “But our laws recognize that such violence is particularly pernicious when somebody is targeted because of their race, their religion, or their national origin.”



Many initial responses to the attack focused on its potential connection to antisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war, but top Trump administration officials quickly began a discussion about immigration policy. According to DHS, the suspect entered the country on a B2 non-immigrant visa in August 2022 — filing an asylum claim the following month — and was authorized to stay until February 2023 but never left.

The B2 non-immigrant visa allows foreign nationals to temporarily enter the country for tourism, pleasure or medical treatment.

“This individual, this terrorist was allowed into this country by the previous administration, was foolishly given a tourism visa, and then was illegally allowed to stay,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday afternoon. “These individuals are going to be deported, and we’re not going to tolerate such violence in our country.”

Eyewitness videos show a shirtless man holding what appear to be two Molotov cocktails and yelling “Free Palestine!” at a group of demonstrators seeking the release of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza, and Israeli flags were seen on the ground after the attack.

The Anti-Defamation League in a post on X described the demonstration as a “weekly meeting of Jewish community members to run/walk in support of the hostages kidnapped.” One of the organizers of the group had posted on social media raising awareness for the demonstration, saying that the group met in downtown Boulder every Sunday for a “weekly humanitarian walk.”

FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino posted Sunday on X that the FBI was investigating a “targeted terror attack” in Boulder.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,” Bongino posted. “We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it.”

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard wrote in a social media post that the National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI on the investigation.

Police said eight people - aged between 52 and 88 - were hurt in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver.

The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect had used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices.

Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group, holding what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Police received calls around 13:26 local time (19:26 GMT) on Sunday about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn told a news conference.

One of those hurt in the attack was a Holocaust survivor, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a ""very loving person"" to the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks that appears to be related to the conflict in Gaza.

A man who shouted ""free Palestine"" fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.

After Sunday's incident, witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd"", Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI's Denver office, said.

He identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who was taken to hospital after being arrested and later booked into the county jail on a number of charges. He is due to appear in court later on Monday.

Mr Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials told CBS. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources told the broadcaster, and had been living in Colorado Springs.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr Soliman had been given a work permit after his visa expired under the previous Biden administration.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security, said the suspect entered the country on a tourist visa and filed for asylum in September 2022.

Footage that appeared to be from the attack shows a chaotic scene: smoke filling the air, people running in multiple directions, spots of grass on fire and people injured on the ground.

In images and videos posted online, a man who appears to be the suspect is seen without a shirt and holding bottles with liquid with pieces of red cloth inside them. He can be heard yelling at the crowd and appears to be advancing towards them as some rush to flee.

As he screams, one woman is seen on the ground and appears injured. People surround her and a man pours water on her body.

Footage shows police rushing to the scene and arresting the suspect. Police say he was taken to hospital with injuries.

""It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Mr Michalek said. ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country.""

Colorado's Attorney General Phil Weiser said that from what officials knew, the attack ""appears to be hate crime given the group that was targeted"".

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said in a statement on Sunday. ""Hate has no place in Colorado.""

Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, said he was ""shocked"" by the incident and called the attack ""pure antisemitism fuelled by the blood libels spread in the media"".

Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called for ""concrete action"" in response to the attack.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said.

LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is calling for an emergency meeting at City Hall to assess security across Los Angeles following what authorities describe as a targeted terror attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.

Eight people were injured when the suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into a crowd.

The incident, which injured several elderly participants, has renewed concerns over rising antisemitic violence nationwide.

What we know

Bass is calling for an emergency meeting at City Hall to evaluate security in Los Angeles.

This comes after what is being described as a ""terror"" attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.

The demonstrators were participating in a weekly gathering called ""Run for Their Lives,"" which raises awareness for hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas following the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. Witnesses said the suspect yelled ""Free Palestine"" during the attack.

According to officials, eight people—four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88—were hospitalized in Denver for burn injuries.

The victims were described as elderly and defenseless, and eyewitnesses reported scenes of panic and trauma at the outdoor mall where the incident occurred.

Boulder police took 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman into custody. Law enforcement officials—including bomb squad teams and K-9 units—shut down several city blocks while searching for additional devices.

Authorities now believe the suspect acted alone.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa and is in the country illegally.

He has been booked on charges that include murder in the first degree, although there have been no confirmed reports that any of the victims died. According to Boulder County Jail records, other charges against Soliman include first degree assault and crimes against an at-risk adult over 70.

Mayor Karen Bass issued a statement Sunday condemning the attack and announcing increased security in Los Angeles:

""What happened in Boulder, Colorado today — an especially brutal targeting of elders — is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,"" Bass said. ""This was the second terrorist attack against Jews in two weeks — I will be calling an emergency meeting at City Hall regarding safety and security here in Los Angeles immediately after Shavuot.""

""LAPD is conducting extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers throughout L.A. Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in this city.""
• None Sunday: Demonstrators gathered for a weekly event organized by ""Run for Their Lives"" in Boulder.
• None Later Sunday: Mayor Bass issued her statement and announced extra LAPD patrols.
• None On May 21, in Washington, D.C., a man armed with a handgun opened fire on a group of people outside of the Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, killing two staff members of the Embassy of Israel.

What we don't know

It’s unclear whether the attack is part of a broader trend of coordinated antisemitic violence or an isolated incident.

The emergency meeting at City Hall will take place after the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is celebrated from sundown Sunday through sundown Tuesday.

Shavuot commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses and the Israelites at Mount Sinai.

The incident, which injured several elderly participants, has renewed concerns over rising antisemitic violence nationwide.

What we know

Bass is calling for an emergency meeting at City Hall to evaluate security in Los Angeles.

This comes after what is being described as a ""terror"" attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.

The demonstrators were participating in a weekly gathering called ""Run for Their Lives,"" which raises awareness for hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas following the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. Witnesses said the suspect yelled ""Free Palestine"" during the attack.

According to officials, eight people—four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88—were hospitalized in Denver for burn injuries.

The victims were described as elderly and defenseless, and eyewitnesses reported scenes of panic and trauma at the outdoor mall where the incident occurred.

Boulder police took 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman into custody. Law enforcement officials—including bomb squad teams and K-9 units—shut down several city blocks while searching for additional devices.

Authorities now believe the suspect acted alone.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa and is in the country illegally.

He has been booked on charges that include murder in the first degree, although there have been no confirmed reports that any of the victims died. According to Boulder County Jail records, other charges against Soliman include first degree assault and crimes against an at-risk adult over 70.

Mayor Karen Bass issued a statement Sunday condemning the attack and announcing increased security in Los Angeles:

""What happened in Boulder, Colorado today — an especially brutal targeting of elders — is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,"" Bass said. ""This was the second terrorist attack against Jews in two weeks — I will be calling an emergency meeting at City Hall regarding safety and security here in Los Angeles immediately after Shavuot.""

""LAPD is conducting extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers throughout L.A. Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in this city.""
• None Sunday: Demonstrators gathered for a weekly event organized by ""Run for Their Lives"" in Boulder.
• None Later Sunday: Mayor Bass issued her statement and announced extra LAPD patrols.
• None On May 21, in Washington, D.C., a man armed with a handgun opened fire on a group of people outside of the Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, killing two staff members of the Embassy of Israel.

What we don't know

It’s unclear whether the attack is part of a broader trend of coordinated antisemitic violence or an isolated incident.

The emergency meeting at City Hall will take place after the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is celebrated from sundown Sunday through sundown Tuesday.

Shavuot commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses and the Israelites at Mount Sinai.

Over the weekend, Soliman injured six people who were part of a demonstration at the mall to raise awareness for the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas terrorists. Soliman allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower in an attempt to murder the demonstrators and yelled “Free Palestine” before the attack.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials subsequently told Fox News’s Bill Melugin that Soliman arrived in the United States via LAX in Los Angeles, California, on a tourist visa in August 2022. The visa expired in February 2023, but Soliman never departed the U.S. as required by federal law, making him an illegal alien.

Even after his visa had expired, former President Joe Biden’s administration approved a work permit for him to hold an American job in March 2023. That work permit expired in March of this year.

DHS sources told CNN that Soliman had previously attempted to enter the U.S. 20 years ago but was denied a visa. It is still unclear why Biden’s DHS approved Soliman for a tourist visa following his prior denial of a visa.

“A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien,” White House senior adviser Stephen Miller wrote on X. “He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, took concealed carry classes and learned to shoot as he planned the attack, only switching to Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower after he could not buy a gun because of his immigration status, county investigators said in an arrest affidavit.

Police identified four additional victims in the attack on Monday, bringing the total to 12, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said during an afternoon briefing. The four additional victims had minor injuries, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said. The eight victims announced Sunday were all burned, and two of them remained in the hospital Monday. Officials could not say whether any of the victims were bystanders.

Soliman, an Egyptian citizen living in Colorado illegally, was charged with a federal hate crime in Sunday’s attack, according to an FBI arrest affidavit. The U.S. Department of Justice characterized the weekend incident as an “antisemitic terror attack.”

If convicted, Soliman could spend up to life in prison, Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado J. Bishop Grewell said Monday afternoon. When asked about possible terrorism charges, Grewell said his office may file additional charges in the case.

Soliman was also arrested on suspicion of 42 state felony charges, according to the Boulder County arrest affidavit. The state charges under investigation include:
• Eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation,
• Eight counts of attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference,
• Six counts of first-degree assault of an at-risk or elderly victim,
• Two counts of possession of an incendiary device,
• And 16 counts of attempted possession of an incendiary device.

He faces up to 624 years in prison if convicted on all counts.

Soliman made his first court appearance virtually from the Boulder County Jail on Monday afternoon, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a bandage around his head covering both ears. Judge Nancy W. Salomone advised that he should have no contact with any of the victims under a protection order and did not change his $10 million bail.

The jail was on lockdown and inmates could not leave their cells during the hearing, which allowed deputies to monitor the courtroom and the jail’s entrance, Boulder County Sheriff’s Public Information Officer Vinnie Montez said. At least three snipers were also stationed on the roof of the jail.

Boulder County prosecutors will file additional charges later this week for the four victims identified Monday, Dougherty said. Boulder police had not encountered Soliman before Sunday and he was not on the FBI’s radar, Redfearn and Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek said.

“We stand united in denouncing hate, terror and violence in this community,” Dougherty said Monday afternoon. “We stand united in condemning acts of antisemitism, hate and violence, and we’re also united in a strong response to this horrific attack.”

Soliman drove from Castle Rock to the Pearl Street Mall armed with 18 Molotov cocktails and a backpack weed sprayer filled with gasoline that he planned to use to kill a group of demonstrators before killing himself, according to court records.

The attack happened just before the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which began at sundown on Sunday.

The 45-year-old told investigators that he waited for a year to attack the “Zionist group” because he wanted his daughter to graduate from high school first, according to his arrest affidavit.

The group, Run for Their Lives, is part of a national movement calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza. The Boulder chapter hosts a weekly walk on the Pearl Street Mall, scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday, when Soliman attacked them outside the courthouse.

Soliman told investigators the attack was revenge because the demonstrators did not care about Palestinian hostages and supported the deaths of Palestinians, according to an affidavit.

“When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die, he had no regrets and he would go back and do it again,” Grewell said at the Monday afternoon briefing.

Soliman arrived at 12:55 p.m. and waited for demonstrators to reach him. He was dressed like a gardener and carried flowers he bought from Home Depot in an effort to get as close to the group as possible, investigators wrote.

Soliman threw two of the Molotov cocktails and police recovered another 16 at the scene, Dougherty said. They were made with glass wine carafes and canning jars filled with gasoline that had red rags hanging out.

“Mohamed said he only threw two at the group because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” federal investigators wrote in an affidavit. “He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it.”

Soliman didn’t expect to survive the attack and sprayed himself with gasoline so that he would burn alongside his victims, police said in his arrest affidavits.

Investigators also found rags, a red gas container and paperwork with the words “Israel,” “Palestine” and “USAID” inside Soliman’s Toyota Prius, which was parked behind a church at 13th and Spruce streets, investigators wrote.

Who is the suspect?

Federal officials said Soliman was born in Egypt and lived in Kuwait for 17 years before he moved to the Colorado Springs area with his wife and five children.

He arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 and was in the country illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, federal immigration officials said. He applied for asylum in September 2022, but federal officials did not disclose any other details about his asylum case on Monday.

Soliman lived with his family in a modest townhome on a cul-de-sac east of Colorado Springs. No one answered the door on Monday morning, but officials said the family cooperated with a search warrant.

A Spider-Man bicycle with training wheels was parked on the sidewalk, and several other tricycles and toys were stacked near the front door.

Neighbors said multiple children, ranging in age from toddlers to teenagers, lived in the home with Soliman. An adult woman also lived there, multiple neighbors said.

The children often played outside in front of the row of townhouses, where gravel covers the yard. Most of the homes in the area are rentals.

The neighbors who spoke to The Denver Post declined to give their names, saying they did not want to be associated with the attack in any way. They said they only knew the family casually, just waving and saying hello if they saw each other outside.

Shameka Pruiett told the Associated Press that she knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbors with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who’d play with Pruiett’s kids in front of their building, share food and hellos.

But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognize him.

“There had to be something deeply disturbing him, cause that is not the guy we see in the neighborhood,” said Pruiett.

An online resume under Soliman’s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.

Police said eight people - aged between 52 and 88 - were hurt in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver.

The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect had used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices.

Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group, holding what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested.

The attack unfolded during a weekly scheduled demonstration put on by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group that holds walks in the outdoor pedestrian mall in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Police received calls around 13:26 local time (19:26 GMT) on Sunday about a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn told a news conference.

One of those hurt in the attack was a Holocaust survivor, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Wilhelm described the 88-year-old as a ""very loving person"" to the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The attack is the second high-profile act of violence in the US in the last two weeks that appears to be related to the conflict in Gaza.

A man who shouted ""free Palestine"" fatally shot two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on 22 May. The incident happened at a networking event organised by a Jewish organisation.

After Sunday's incident, witnesses told authorities that the suspect used a ""makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd"", Mark Michalek, who heads the FBI's Denver office, said.

He identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who was taken to hospital after being arrested and later booked into the county jail on a number of charges. He is due to appear in court later on Monday.

Mr Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials told CBS. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources told the broadcaster, and had been living in Colorado Springs.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Mr Soliman had been given a work permit after his visa expired under the previous Biden administration.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security, said the suspect entered the country on a tourist visa and filed for asylum in September 2022.

Footage that appeared to be from the attack shows a chaotic scene: smoke filling the air, people running in multiple directions, spots of grass on fire and people injured on the ground.

In images and videos posted online, a man who appears to be the suspect is seen without a shirt and holding bottles with liquid with pieces of red cloth inside them. He can be heard yelling at the crowd and appears to be advancing towards them as some rush to flee.

As he screams, one woman is seen on the ground and appears injured. People surround her and a man pours water on her body.

Footage shows police rushing to the scene and arresting the suspect. Police say he was taken to hospital with injuries.

""It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" Mr Michalek said. ""Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country.""

Colorado's Attorney General Phil Weiser said that from what officials knew, the attack ""appears to be hate crime given the group that was targeted"".

""People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,"" Weiser said in a statement on Sunday. ""Hate has no place in Colorado.""

Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, said he was ""shocked"" by the incident and called the attack ""pure antisemitism fuelled by the blood libels spread in the media"".

Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called for ""concrete action"" in response to the attack.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border – it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said.

Boulder police on Sunday identified Soliman, 45, as a resident of El Paso County, Colorado. On Monday, administration officials confirmed that he lacked immigration status to be in the U.S.

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a post to X Monday morning. “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.” Soliman would have entered the U.S. on a B2, nonimmigrant visa, meaning he was approved to stay in the country temporarily. The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the White House did not respond to requests regarding Soliman’s country of origin. However, Soliman is reported to be an Egyptian national. White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said Soliman had “illegally overstayed” a tourist visa. One month after arriving, Soliman reportedly filed an unspecified claim in September 2022 seeking documents to work legally and was granted them in March 2023, according to CNN. His work permit lasted two years. Soliman was also said to have attempted to enter the U.S. in 2025 but was denied. Soliman was immediately detained by local police and has been charged with multiple felonies for allegedly using a flamethrower to set people on fire in what is being investigated as a terrorist attack. He is due in court later Monday.",Mohamed Soliman is said to be an illegal immigrant from Egypt who entered during the Biden administration.

‘I'm just waiting for the ""he was on our radar"" statement to come out’

Netizens took to the comment section to react to the incident, with many raising various questions. “How long did it take from the first 911 call to the officers on scene? Why aren’t officers patrolling Pearl street constantly?” one user asked. “Quick question — what time does @RealTomHoman’s @DHSgov team pick this guy up? Boulder deserves better than silence and virtue signals after a terrorist attack on peaceful demonstrators — and a catch-and-release culture that’s become the norm under our DA,” another wrote. One said, “I'm just waiting for the ""he was on our radar"" statement to come out.”

Authorities have confirmed that Soliman was in the United States illegallyafter overstaying his visa. Homeland Security officials told Fox News that he originally entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport on August 27, 2022.

LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is calling for an emergency meeting at City Hall to assess security across Los Angeles following what authorities describe as a targeted terror attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.

Eight people were injured when the suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into a crowd.

The incident, which injured several elderly participants, has renewed concerns over rising antisemitic violence nationwide.

What we know

Bass is calling for an emergency meeting at City Hall to evaluate security in Los Angeles.

This comes after what is being described as a ""terror"" attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado.

The demonstrators were participating in a weekly gathering called ""Run for Their Lives,"" which raises awareness for hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas following the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. Witnesses said the suspect yelled ""Free Palestine"" during the attack.

According to officials, eight people—four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88—were hospitalized in Denver for burn injuries.

The victims were described as elderly and defenseless, and eyewitnesses reported scenes of panic and trauma at the outdoor mall where the incident occurred.

Boulder police took 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman into custody. Law enforcement officials—including bomb squad teams and K-9 units—shut down several city blocks while searching for additional devices.

Authorities now believe the suspect acted alone.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Soliman is an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa and is in the country illegally.

He has been booked on charges that include murder in the first degree, although there have been no confirmed reports that any of the victims died. According to Boulder County Jail records, other charges against Soliman include first degree assault and crimes against an at-risk adult over 70.

Mayor Karen Bass issued a statement Sunday condemning the attack and announcing increased security in Los Angeles:

""What happened in Boulder, Colorado today — an especially brutal targeting of elders — is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,"" Bass said. ""This was the second terrorist attack against Jews in two weeks — I will be calling an emergency meeting at City Hall regarding safety and security here in Los Angeles immediately after Shavuot.""

""LAPD is conducting extra patrols at houses of worship and community centers throughout L.A. Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in this city.""
• None Sunday: Demonstrators gathered for a weekly event organized by ""Run for Their Lives"" in Boulder.
• None Later Sunday: Mayor Bass issued her statement and announced extra LAPD patrols.
• None On May 21, in Washington, D.C., a man armed with a handgun opened fire on a group of people outside of the Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, killing two staff members of the Embassy of Israel.

What we don't know

It’s unclear whether the attack is part of a broader trend of coordinated antisemitic violence or an isolated incident.

The emergency meeting at City Hall will take place after the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is celebrated from sundown Sunday through sundown Tuesday.

Shavuot commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses and the Israelites at Mount Sinai.

Boulder police on Sunday identified Soliman, 45, as a resident of El Paso County, Colorado. On Monday, administration officials confirmed that he lacked immigration status to be in the U.S.

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a post to X Monday morning. “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.” Soliman would have entered the U.S. on a B2, nonimmigrant visa, meaning he was approved to stay in the country temporarily. The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the White House did not respond to requests regarding Soliman’s country of origin. However, Soliman is reported to be an Egyptian national. White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said Soliman had “illegally overstayed” a tourist visa. One month after arriving, Soliman reportedly filed an unspecified claim in September 2022 seeking documents to work legally and was granted them in March 2023, according to CNN. His work permit lasted two years. Soliman was also said to have attempted to enter the U.S. in 2025 but was denied. Soliman was immediately detained by local police and has been charged with multiple felonies for allegedly using a flamethrower to set people on fire in what is being investigated as a terrorist attack. He is due in court later Monday.",Mohamed Soliman is said to be an illegal immigrant from Egypt who entered during the Biden administration.

BOULDER, Colo. — A man armed with a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices launched a fiery attack on demonstrators in Colorado who were calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a “targeted terror attack.”

The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled “Free Palestine” durig the attack Sunday, according to Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. Authorities believe Soliman acted alone.

He faces multiple federal and state charges, including commission of a hate crime.

How did the attack unfold

Authorities said the attacker targeted volunteers with Run for Their Lives, which organizes running and walking events to call for the immediate release of Israelis being held in Gaza. The hostages were captured by militants during an incursion into southern Israel in 2023 that precipitated the latest Israel-Hamas war.

The group gathered Sunday at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students. Witnesses said the suspect first used the flame thrower, then threw two Molotov cocktails into the crowd. Soliman was arrested at the scene.

Video from the scene shows a shirtless Soliman shouting at onlookers while holding two clear bottles containing a transparent liquid. Another video shows a witness shouting: “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.

One witness, Alex Osante, said Soliman appeared to catch himself on fire during the attack. A booking photo shows him with a bandage over one of his ears. Police said he was taken to the hospital after he was arrested but haven’t described his injuries.

What was his motive?

Witnesses said Soliman yelled “Free Palestine” as he launched the attack. An FBI affidavit said he confessed to the attack.

He told investigators “he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” that he specifically targeted the Run for Their Lives group and that he had researched and planned the attack for more than a year, according to the affidavit.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington, D.C., by a man who yelled “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza” as he was led away by police.

Soliman is charged federally with commission of a hate crime, which carries a sentence of life in prison when the charge includes attempted murder. Colorado state charges include 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of using an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

Additional charges are possible in federal court. The Justice Department plans to seek a grand jury indictment.

Soliman was born in Egypt and he moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, where he lived with his wife and five children, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

The Department of Homeland Security said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and has been living in the U.S. illegally since his visa expired in February 2023.

Soliman worked as an Uber driver and had passed the company’s eligibility requirements, which include a criminal background check, according to a spokesperson for Uber.

An online resume under Suliman’s name says he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Soliman listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo, on the resume.

The people injured in the Pearl Street attack range in age from 52 to 88. Their injuries — some serious and some minor — were consistent with reports of people being set on fire, Redfearn said.

Authorities initially said there were eight victims, but said four others later were identified.

Photos from the scene showed a burning woman lying on the ground in a fetal position and a man helping to put out the flames using a jug of water.

“The immense wave of positive messages we’ve received is another signal of the health and strong spirits of our community,” Rabbi Yisroel and Leah Wilhelm, directors of the Rohr Chabad House at the University of Colorado said in a statement. “We encourage everyone to respond energetically to this attack by celebrating Shavuot joyously, by attending the reading of the Ten Commandments, and by recommitting to the heritage and traditions we hold so dear.""","Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower."

Witnesses said the suspect used a “makeshift flamethrower” and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims, police and the FBI said. Boulder police say eight people were injured.

The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling “Free Palestine” during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was “clear this is a targeted act of violence” and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.

Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, multiple sources told CBS News. That original visa expired in February 2023, the sources said. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.

The FBI said later Sunday night it was “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder” in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.

A walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place in Boulder’s downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled “End Zionist!” during the attack.

The victims of the attack included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be “safe to say” that person was in critical condition.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a “very loving person.” Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.

The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.

UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.

Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.

Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday’s event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said around 3:30 p.m. that FBI agents were at the scene.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media, “The @ODNIgov’s National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,” according to the Reuters news agency.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a “heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.”

“As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,” Polis said. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Run For Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, “This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.” The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they’ve been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday’s walk.

Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.

“So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn’t even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I’m just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,” said Victor.

Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.

“I saw the aftermath,” said street performer Peter Irish. “It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.”

University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, “My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today’s violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.”

We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.

We don’t have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed.

Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.

We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured.

We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.

Strength to you all.

 Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon.

My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today’s attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.

From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General’s Office.

People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts—which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home—must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.","A suspect is in custody after what the FBI is calling a ""targeted act of violence"" during a peaceful march in support of Israeli hostages at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. "

Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.

We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured.

We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.

Strength to you all.

 Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon.

My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today’s attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.

From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General’s Office.

People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts—which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home—must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.","A suspect is in custody after what the FBI is calling a ""targeted act of violence"" during a peaceful march in support of Israeli hostages at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. "

Eight people were injured on Sunday, with one in critical condition, after Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly targeted a pro-Israel peaceful protest aimed at advocating for the release of Hamas hostages. Police said they received reports of a man who was setting people on fire.

Leo Terrell, senior counsel for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, said in a post on X that one of the victims is a Holocaust survivor.

""One of the victims of the Boulder attack was a Holocaust survivor. She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,"" Terrell said. ""And now, decades later, she’s victimized again by a terrorist screaming ‘Free Palestine.’ The same slogan another terrorist just screamed when murdering Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim on May 21.""

""The attack on this survivor reminds me of the horror of October 7, when Holocaust survivors were murdered and dragged away by Hamas terrorists in Israel,"" he added.

Soliman was charged with murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent - criminal attempt; murder in the first degree – extreme indifference - criminal attempt; crimes against at-risk adults/elderly; first-degree assault – non-family; first-degree assault – heat of passion; criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies; and use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony.

He was booked into jail on Sunday where he remains on a $10 million bond. The alleged attack happened on Sunday during a gathering held by pro-Israel group ""Run for Their Lives.""

During the attack, Soliman was allegedly heard yelling, ""Free Palestine.""

According to sources who spoke with Fox News, Soliman was in the United States illegally and is an Egyptian national.

The sources said Soliman first entered the U.S. on Aug. 27, 2022 on a B1/B2 non-immigrant, visa that expired on Feb. 26, 2023, but he didn't leave.

Soliman filed a claim with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services on March 29, 2023, which authorized him to work through March 2025.

FBI director Kash Patel has described the incident as a terror attack.

• Federal prosecutors charged the suspect in a fire attack on demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, with a charge of hate crime.
• A criminal complaint filed against the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, said there is probable cause to believe he attacked the demonstrators because they were supporting Israel in calling for the release of hostages still being held by the Palestinian terror group Hamas.
• President Donald Trump condemned the attack and blamed former President Joe Biden for a border policy that Trump said allowed entry to the accused assailant.

The man accused of a fire attack on demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, was charged with multiple counts of attempted murder on Monday in state court.

Prosecutors asked that a judge order Mohamed Sabry Soliman held on a $10 million cash bond ""given the seriousness of the crimes.""

Soliman, 45, was also hit with a federal hate crime charge by prosecutors, who revealed that the married dad of five confessed that he had planned the horrific assault for a year, and waited until his daughter graduated from school to commit it.

An FBI affidavit filed as part of that federal complaint said there is probable cause to believe Soliman attacked the demonstrators on Sunday with a makeshift flamethrower because they were supporting Israel in calling for the release of hostages still being held by the Palestinian terror group Hamas.

Soliman is due to appear Monday afternoon in Boulder court to face the state charges related to the attack, which left eight people hospitalized with burns and other injuries.

He is charged there with eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation, and another eight counts of attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference.

Soliman also faces six counts of first-degree assault on an at-risk victim, two counts of possession of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted possession of an incendiary device.

He is charged in U.S. District Court in Colorado with a hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.

Prosecutors plan to ask a federal judge to detain Soliman in the federal case without bail.

An affidavit signed by an FBI agent says that Soliman threw ""Molotov cocktails into a pro-Israel crowd while yelling 'Free Palestine.' ""

The affidavit says that after he was detained by law enforcement, authorities found a black plastic container with a yellow top near the site of the arrest.

In that container ""were at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Bell jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles,"" the affidavit says.

The liquid in those bottles, and a backpack weed sprayer also found nearby, was determined to be 87 octane gasoline, the agent wrote.

Authorities who searched Soliman's 2015 Toyota Prius found a red gas container inside, and ""paperwork with the words, 'Israel,' 'Palestine,' and 'USAID,' "" which is the acronym for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the affidavit said

""Soliman as placed under arrest and a mirandized interview was conducted by local and federal law enforcement,"" the affidavit said.

""During the interview, Soliman stated that he researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them,"" the agent wrote.

""He traveled to Boulder, Colorado in his vehicle with the Molotov cocktails and threw two of the cocktails at individuals participating in a pro-Israel gathering. He also stated that he picked up gas at a gas station on the way to Boulder,"" the affidavit said. ""He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead.""

""Soliman stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again. He specifically targeted the 'Zionist Group' that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search.""

""Throughout the interview, Soliman stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over 'our land,' which he explained to be Palestine,"" the affidavit said.

""He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.""

Shortly before the federal hate crime charge was revealed, President Donald Trump condemned the attack and blamed former President Joe Biden for a border policy that Trump said allowed entry to the accused assailant.

""Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,"" Trump wrote in a social media post.

""He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly,"" Trump wrote. ""He must go out under ""TRUMP"" Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

Witnesses said the suspect used a “makeshift flamethrower” and threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims, police and the FBI said. Boulder police say eight people were injured.

The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling “Free Palestine” during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was “clear this is a targeted act of violence” and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.

Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, multiple sources told CBS News. That original visa expired in February 2023, the sources said. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.

The FBI said later Sunday night it was “conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder” in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.

A walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place in Boulder’s downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also allegedly yelled “End Zionist!” during the attack.

The victims of the attack included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, police said. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be “safe to say” that person was in critical condition.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a “very loving person.” Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.

The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.

UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.

Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.

Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday’s event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said around 3:30 p.m. that FBI agents were at the scene.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media, “The @ODNIgov’s National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,” according to the Reuters news agency.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a “heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.”

“As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,” Polis said. “Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Run For Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, “This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release.” The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they’ve been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday’s walk.

Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.

“So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn’t even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I’m just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,” said Victor.

Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.

“I saw the aftermath,” said street performer Peter Irish. “It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.”

University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, “My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today’s violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.”

We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza.

We don’t have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed.

Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured.

We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured.

We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.

Strength to you all.

 Attorney General Phil Weiser denounced the attack and offered to help the victims in a release Sunday afternoon.

My thoughts are with those injured and impacted by today’s attack against a group that meets weekly on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall to call for the release of the hostages in Gaza.

From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted. I have been in touch with Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and have offered support from the Attorney General’s Office.

People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences. Hate has no place in Colorado. We all have the right to peaceably assemble and the freedom to speak our views. But these violent acts—which are becoming more frequent, brazen, and closer to home—must stop and those who commit these horrific acts must be fully held to account.","A suspect is in custody after what the FBI is calling a ""targeted act of violence"" during a peaceful march in support of Israeli hostages at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. "

Eight people were injured on Sunday, with one in critical condition, after Mohamed Sabry Soliman allegedly targeted a pro-Israel peaceful protest aimed at advocating for the release of Hamas hostages. Police said they received reports of a man who was setting people on fire.

Leo Terrell, senior counsel for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, said in a post on X that one of the victims is a Holocaust survivor.

""One of the victims of the Boulder attack was a Holocaust survivor. She endured the worst evil in human history. She came to America seeking safety,"" Terrell said. ""And now, decades later, she’s victimized again by a terrorist screaming ‘Free Palestine.’ The same slogan another terrorist just screamed when murdering Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim on May 21.""

""The attack on this survivor reminds me of the horror of October 7, when Holocaust survivors were murdered and dragged away by Hamas terrorists in Israel,"" he added.

Soliman was charged with murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent - criminal attempt; murder in the first degree – extreme indifference - criminal attempt; crimes against at-risk adults/elderly; first-degree assault – non-family; first-degree assault – heat of passion; criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies; and use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony.

He was booked into jail on Sunday where he remains on a $10 million bond. The alleged attack happened on Sunday during a gathering held by pro-Israel group ""Run for Their Lives.""

During the attack, Soliman was allegedly heard yelling, ""Free Palestine.""

According to sources who spoke with Fox News, Soliman was in the United States illegally and is an Egyptian national.

The sources said Soliman first entered the U.S. on Aug. 27, 2022 on a B1/B2 non-immigrant, visa that expired on Feb. 26, 2023, but he didn't leave.

Soliman filed a claim with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services on March 29, 2023, which authorized him to work through March 2025.

FBI director Kash Patel has described the incident as a terror attack.

• Federal prosecutors charged the suspect in a fire attack on demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, with a charge of hate crime.
• A criminal complaint filed against the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, said there is probable cause to believe he attacked the demonstrators because they were supporting Israel in calling for the release of hostages still being held by the Palestinian terror group Hamas.
• President Donald Trump condemned the attack and blamed former President Joe Biden for a border policy that Trump said allowed entry to the accused assailant.

The man accused of a fire attack on demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, was charged with multiple counts of attempted murder on Monday in state court.

Prosecutors asked that a judge order Mohamed Sabry Soliman held on a $10 million cash bond ""given the seriousness of the crimes.""

Soliman, 45, was also hit with a federal hate crime charge by prosecutors, who revealed that the married dad of five confessed that he had planned the horrific assault for a year, and waited until his daughter graduated from school to commit it.

An FBI affidavit filed as part of that federal complaint said there is probable cause to believe Soliman attacked the demonstrators on Sunday with a makeshift flamethrower because they were supporting Israel in calling for the release of hostages still being held by the Palestinian terror group Hamas.

Soliman is due to appear Monday afternoon in Boulder court to face the state charges related to the attack, which left eight people hospitalized with burns and other injuries.

He is charged there with eight counts of attempted first-degree murder after deliberation, and another eight counts of attempted first-degree murder with extreme indifference.

Soliman also faces six counts of first-degree assault on an at-risk victim, two counts of possession of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted possession of an incendiary device.

He is charged in U.S. District Court in Colorado with a hate crime involving actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.

Prosecutors plan to ask a federal judge to detain Soliman in the federal case without bail.

An affidavit signed by an FBI agent says that Soliman threw ""Molotov cocktails into a pro-Israel crowd while yelling 'Free Palestine.' ""

The affidavit says that after he was detained by law enforcement, authorities found a black plastic container with a yellow top near the site of the arrest.

In that container ""were at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Bell jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles,"" the affidavit says.

The liquid in those bottles, and a backpack weed sprayer also found nearby, was determined to be 87 octane gasoline, the agent wrote.

Authorities who searched Soliman's 2015 Toyota Prius found a red gas container inside, and ""paperwork with the words, 'Israel,' 'Palestine,' and 'USAID,' "" which is the acronym for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the affidavit said

""Soliman as placed under arrest and a mirandized interview was conducted by local and federal law enforcement,"" the affidavit said.

""During the interview, Soliman stated that he researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them,"" the agent wrote.

""He traveled to Boulder, Colorado in his vehicle with the Molotov cocktails and threw two of the cocktails at individuals participating in a pro-Israel gathering. He also stated that he picked up gas at a gas station on the way to Boulder,"" the affidavit said. ""He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead.""

""Soliman stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again. He specifically targeted the 'Zionist Group' that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search.""

""Throughout the interview, Soliman stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over 'our land,' which he explained to be Palestine,"" the affidavit said.

""He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.""

Shortly before the federal hate crime charge was revealed, President Donald Trump condemned the attack and blamed former President Joe Biden for a border policy that Trump said allowed entry to the accused assailant.

""Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,"" Trump wrote in a social media post.

""He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly,"" Trump wrote. ""He must go out under ""TRUMP"" Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!""

Soliman was in the United States illegally on an expired work permit, according to the White House.","Mohamed Sabry Soliman is due in court to face state charges in the attack protestors in Boulder, Colorado, calling for the release of Israeli hostages."

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, told investigators he wanted to ""kill all Zionist people"" but had delayed committing the attack in the city of Boulder until after his daughter had graduated from high school, according to state and federal court documents charging him with attempted murder, assault and a federal hate crime.

Police and FBI affidavits quoted the suspect as saying he had learned to shoot a gun in a class he took hoping to get a concealed-carry permit but ended up using Molotov cocktails because of his immigration status.

A police affidavit filed in support of Soliman's arrest warrant said he was born in Egypt, lived in Kuwait for 17 years and moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, about 60km south of Boulder, where he lived with his wife and five children.

""In light of yesterday's horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X.

According to the Boulder police affidavit, Soliman had planned for a year to carry out the attack, which unfolded on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado.

The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans linked to outrage over Israel's escalating military offensive in Gaza. It followed the fatal shooting of two Israel Embassy aides that took place outside Washington's Capital Jewish Museum last month.","An Egyptian man who told US investigators that he wanted to ""kill all Zionist people"" has been charged..."

“There is a male with a blow torch setting people on fire,” a dispatcher advised the city’s police department, passing on the account of an eyewitness. Another official reported: “Multiple burns, potential terror attack.”

What had been a peaceful rally at the Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall on Sunday in solidarity with hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza quickly turned into a scene of horror, with medical crews arriving to find victims lying or sitting on the ground with their legs and bodies burned – and police holding a suspect face down with a gun at his back.

Members of the public raced from local restaurants with buckets and jugs of water to pour over those who were injured.

The attack by a man hurling molotov cocktails and shouting “Free Palestine” struck at the heart of one of Colorado’s largest Jewish communities, just 10 days after two Israeli embassy staffers were shot dead in Washington DC by a man yelling the same statement. It also came weeks after an arson attack on the home of Josh Shapiro, the Jewish governor of Pennsylvania, by a pro-Palestinian activist.

“Make no mistake: if and when Jews are targeted to protest Israel’s actions, it should clearly and unequivocally be understood and condemned as antisemitism,” Amy Spitalnick, chief executive of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement.

“These attacks come alongside a broader rise in antisemitism, from hate crimes targeting Jews walking down the street, to efforts to marginalize, isolate, and discriminate against Jews, to antisemitic and white supremacist mass violence targeting synagogues and other spaces.”

Boulder county, where Sunday’s attack took place, had long been considered a safe, “dream community” for Jewish families drawn there over the last decade. Numbers have doubled to represent more than 10% of the county’s 330,000 population.

The eight victims – four men and four women, including an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, and a mother and daughter – represented a cross-section of a vibrant diaspora in a city with numerous Jewish community centers, schools and businesses.

“What happened here in our local community in Boulder is shameful, and I think people really need to have a sense of accountability,” Fred Greene, rabbi of Boulder’s Har HaShem congregation, told CNN on Monday.

“If we want peace, if we want dignity for people, there have to be other ways than this kind of violence.”

Another expert, University of Boulder Hillel executive director Elyana Funk, told the network that the assault was especially shocking because it targeted a “quiet and respectful” assembly of residents who were taking part in a solidarity walk, which has become popular in numerous Jewish communities around the world since the Hamas terror attack on Israel and taking of hostages on 7 October 2023.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

The attack came on the same day as the start of Shavuot, a two-day Jewish festival to celebrate the 50th day after the Passover holiday. Several events were postponed or canceled after the attack, but Funk said resilience would shine through.

“The antidote for antisemitism can be Jewish joy, and Jewish community and Jewish connection,” she said.

Meanwhile, the Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, recalled the community reaction to the 2021 mass shooting at a supermarket in the city that left 10 people dead.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy sadly and I know a lot of people are scared right now and questioning how this happened and why,” he said at a press conference on Sunday night.

“Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover. I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive.”

The attack took place on Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian area of downtown Boulder laced with stores and restaurants, overlooked by the University of Colorado, and a regular venue for the event supporting Run for Their Lives, an organization calling for the immediate release of the Gaza hostages.

Eyewitnesses said the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, appeared out of nowhere and seemingly singled out individuals taking part in the rally.

“It was easily the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Brian Horowitz, 37, told CNN.

The Denver resident said he was in a cafe with his family when he heard screams and raced to confront the suspect, who was shouting profanities at his victims.

“‘Fuck you Zionists,” Horowitz said the man yelled. “‘You’re killing my people so I kill you.’”

Horowitz added: “There’s someone who is outraged enough to go and attack these elderly people who are doing absolutely nothing to provoke it other than walk in silence and meet in a courtyard peacefully.

“There is a male with a blow torch setting people on fire,” a dispatcher advised the city’s police department, passing on the account of an eyewitness. Another official reported: “Multiple burns, potential terror attack.”

What had been a peaceful rally at the Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall on Sunday in solidarity with hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza quickly turned into a scene of horror, with medical crews arriving to find victims lying or sitting on the ground with their legs and bodies burned – and police holding a suspect face down with a gun at his back.

Members of the public raced from local restaurants with buckets and jugs of water to pour over those who were injured.

The attack by a man hurling molotov cocktails and shouting “Free Palestine” struck at the heart of one of Colorado’s largest Jewish communities, just 10 days after two Israeli embassy staffers were shot dead in Washington DC by a man yelling the same statement. It also came weeks after an arson attack on the home of Josh Shapiro, the Jewish governor of Pennsylvania, by a pro-Palestinian activist.

“Make no mistake: if and when Jews are targeted to protest Israel’s actions, it should clearly and unequivocally be understood and condemned as antisemitism,” Amy Spitalnick, chief executive of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement.

“These attacks come alongside a broader rise in antisemitism, from hate crimes targeting Jews walking down the street, to efforts to marginalize, isolate, and discriminate against Jews, to antisemitic and white supremacist mass violence targeting synagogues and other spaces.”

Boulder county, where Sunday’s attack took place, had long been considered a safe, “dream community” for Jewish families drawn there over the last decade. Numbers have doubled to represent more than 10% of the county’s 330,000 population.

The eight victims – four men and four women, including an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, and a mother and daughter – represented a cross-section of a vibrant diaspora in a city with numerous Jewish community centers, schools and businesses.

“What happened here in our local community in Boulder is shameful, and I think people really need to have a sense of accountability,” Fred Greene, rabbi of Boulder’s Har HaShem congregation, told CNN on Monday.

“If we want peace, if we want dignity for people, there have to be other ways than this kind of violence.”

Another expert, University of Boulder Hillel executive director Elyana Funk, told the network that the assault was especially shocking because it targeted a “quiet and respectful” assembly of residents who were taking part in a solidarity walk, which has become popular in numerous Jewish communities around the world since the Hamas terror attack on Israel and taking of hostages on 7 October 2023.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

The attack came on the same day as the start of Shavuot, a two-day Jewish festival to celebrate the 50th day after the Passover holiday. Several events were postponed or canceled after the attack, but Funk said resilience would shine through.

“The antidote for antisemitism can be Jewish joy, and Jewish community and Jewish connection,” she said.

Meanwhile, the Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, recalled the community reaction to the 2021 mass shooting at a supermarket in the city that left 10 people dead.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy sadly and I know a lot of people are scared right now and questioning how this happened and why,” he said at a press conference on Sunday night.

“Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover. I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive.”

Donald Trump has been mocked on social media after his phone background was caught on camera during a press conference.

US President Donald Trump has been mocked after cameras caught a glimpse of his phone's lock screen, revealing a photo of himself. The image, which appears to be an AI-enhanced snap from his latest election campaign, has sparked a frenzy online.

Political commentator Harry Sisson shared his thoughts on TikTok, saying: ""Donald Trump was holding a press conference and his phone screen was seen. Can you take a guess as to what the lockscreen photo is? If you guess himself, you'd be absolutely right.""

Sisson quipped: ""Do you know how narcissistic you have to be to want yourself to be the home screen? You'd be constantly looking at yourself. Normal people might have a photo of themselves and others - family or friends - but no, in Donald Trump's world, it's a constant him.""

Sisson claimed this isn't out of character for Trump, who allegedly has a fondness for hanging portraits of himself on his walls, reports the Mirror. He added: ""He just loves admiring what he looks like, but it's very strange.""

The TikTok clip has racked up 71,000 likes and numerous comments, with one user saying: ""Narcissism on full display.""

Others joked about the possibility of Trump searching for and downloading the image himself, while another compared it to people who display portraits of themselves at home, calling it ""It's like people who have portraits of themselves hanging at home. It's so odd.""

While some criticised the image Donald Trump chose for his lock screen, others failed to see an issue.

Comments included, ""So? I have myself too its quite common actually.""

and queries like ""Is this a problem?"" Another pointed out, ""Lots of people do that, no?"".

Trump's preoccupation with his image is not new; he recently requested the removal of one of his Presidential portraits. In an outlandish tirade on TruthSocial, he lamented, ""Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves. But the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor... was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.""

He acknowledged artist Sarah Boardman for creating a ""wonderful"" portrait of Obama during his Presidency but slammed her efforts on his own depiction: ""He looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst.""

Speaking of the accused attacker, Trump said, ""He came to in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go under ""TRUMP"" Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our Homeland.”

In acknowledging the eight victims in the post, Trump continued, “My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!""

The attack occurred just before 1:30 p.m. Sunday near 13th and Pearl streets during a weekly event called the “peaceful humanitarian walk for hostages,” organized by the group, Run For Their Lives, which raises awareness about Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Witnesses say a man was waiting near the historic courthouse with bottles in hand. He allegedly shouted, “free Palestine” before throwing what officials described as a makeshift flamethrower or Molotov cocktail into the crowd.

Some victims suffered burns and were transported to Denver-area hospitals. UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora confirmed it received two patients who were airlifted from the scene.

The Boulder Police Department on Monday said none of the burn victims had died. According to 9NEWS, one victim is a Holocaust survivor.

The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman of Colorado Springs, was booked into the Boulder County Jail on a $10 million bond.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Sunday said on social media that Soliman had ""illegally overstayed"" a tourist visa.

‘Violence has no place in our state’

In a statement released Sunday evening, Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish and lives in Boulder, said his thoughts go out to the victims of “this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.""

""Boulder is strong,"" he said. ""We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community. I’ve spoken with Boulder Mayor (Aaron) Brockett, and my administration is working closely with local and federal law enforcement on this afternoon’s attack. I thank the first responders who ran to help the injured and ensure victims received medical attention needed and to apprehend the suspect.”

Polis said that with the Jewish community reeling from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is “unfathomable” that the community is facing another antisemitic attack in Boulder.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, who represents Boulder, said he was ""horrified"" by the attack and is praying for the victims.

""Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence,"" he said. ""The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence. We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.""

Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, of Colorado’s Congressional District 4, blamed the attack on progressives allowing and encouraging ""hate speech toward Jews for their mere existence."" She noted the recent killing of a Jewish couple in Washington, D.C. by a man who allegedly said he committed the act ""for Gaza.""

""We just saw it in DC, and it’s sadly no surprise to see it in Boulder,"" Boebert posted on X. ""We need to forcefully condemn this rhetoric and stand with the Jewish community as they continue to be targeted by hateful lunatics. I have been in direct contact with the FBI; they need to take the lead on investigating this as an act of targeted terrorism and not left to local officials.""

""Violence has no place in our community. Targeting people based on their identity or beliefs is not only hateful and cowardly—it is fundamentally at odds with the values of peace, dignity, and inclusivity that we hold dear in Boulder and across Colorado,"" she said. ""I unequivocally condemn this act and all forms of hate.”

Joseph said her heart is with the victims, their families, the Jewish community, and all those who are grieving and shaken by this tragedy. In thanking first responders for their quick reaction, Joseph stressed that Boulder is home to a “thriving Jewish community that makes immeasurable contributions to the cultural, civic, and moral fabric of our city. Without their presence, leadership, and history, we would not be the community we are. Today’s attack is not just an assault on individuals—it is an assault on the very values of inclusion, freedom, and humanity that bind us together.”

Other state lawmakers, including Rep. Ron Weinberg, R-Loveland, who is Jewish and once lived in Israel, called the attack on peaceful protestors, including children, appalling.

""This country was founded on the principles of free speech, peaceful assembly, and religious freedom,"" he said. ""The individuals who gathered in Boulder were exercising those rights and were met with hatred. The suspect must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and law enforcement must treat this as the domestic terror incident it is.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called the attack a likely hate crime, given the targeted nature of the group.

Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty stated that charges are pending and could be brought at either the state or federal level.

House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, R-Colorado Springs, and Assistant Minority Leader Ty Winter, R-Trinidad, said they are praying for the victims and their families.

""Violence has no place in our state—especially when directed at those standing in unity for the innocent,"" said Pugliese.

""Our communities have the right to feel safe while they gather in peace,"" added Winter.

Senate Democrats also released a statement condemning the attacks, with Sen. Judy Amabile, who represents Boulder, saying ""divisive, hateful rhetoric"" needs to stop.

""We all must commit to peace and safety in both our words and our actions,"" she said. ""My thoughts are with the victims, their families, and all those impacted by this tragedy. Boulder is resilient, and we will stand united against violence in all its forms.”

Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, D-Commerce City, moved to the United States from Israel as a child.

“As an Israeli-born, American Jewish woman living in Colorado, I am devastated and heartbroken at the terrorist attack on my friends and colleagues at the Run for Their Lives event in Boulder,” she said. “This event is a weekly peaceful gathering of Israeli and American Jewish families working to bring attention to the hostages who are still being held in Gaza for almost two years following the massacre of the Israeli people on October 7th, 2023. All Jewish communities in Colorado and around the country are on edge as we enter into the Jewish holiday of Shavuot this evening. We live in America for the freedom it affords. Terrorism should never happen here. The violence must end.”

This is a developing story. More details will be shared as they become available.","President Trump and Colorado lawmakers condemn Boulder attack as a hate crime, calling it a domestic terror incident."

The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group,” the FBI said. Eight people were injured in the attack, some with burns, as a group was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Witnesses reported the man yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again. The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the Justice Department on Monday.

Court records show Soliman was scheduled to appear in state court in Boulder at 1:30 p.m.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside of a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement Monday saying he, his wife and the entire nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, which encompasses Boulder.

In New York, the police department said it upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

The eight victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack. A man, who later identified himself as an Israeli visiting Boulder who decided to join the group that day, ran up to Osante on the video asking for some water to help.

Suspect reemerged after initial attack before being arrested

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video that Osante filmed.

Lynn Segal, 72, was among about 20 people who gathered Sunday. They had finished their march in front of the courthouse when a “rope of fire” shot in front of her and then ""two big flares.”

She said the scene quickly turned chaotic as people worked to find water to put out flames and find help.

Law enforcement found more than a dozen unlit Molotov cocktails near where Soliman was arrested. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said. Inside his car, law enforcement found papers with the words “Israel,” “Palestine,” and “USAID,” the affidavit says.

Soliman told investigators that he constructed homemade Molotov cocktails after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients. He drove to Boulder with the devices in his car and stopped along the way for gas, according to the affidavit.

He said in his interview that his goal was to “kill all Zionists,” the FBI said, and that he intentionally targeted the group and knew they they would be assembled on Sunday afternoon.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

The group that was attacked has said it was trying to raise attention to the plight of the Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Authorities say they believe the suspect acted alone

Authorities said Sunday they believe Soliman acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought. No criminal charges were immediately announced but officials said they would move to hold Soliman accountable. He was also injured and was taken to the hospital to be treated. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after having entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Public records listed Soliman as living in a modest rented townhouse in Colorado Springs, where local media outlets reported federal law enforcement agents were on the scene Sunday.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbors with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who’d play with Pruiett’s kids in front of their building, share food and hellos. But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognize him.

“There had to be something deeply disturbing him, cause that is not the guy we see in the neighborhood,” said Pruiett, leaning on her doorframe and gazing several feet away at Soliman’s apartment. Soliman had never been outwardly political, she said, “he didn’t push his views or values on anyone.”

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman’s home to come out. Nobody came out, and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett. The raid lasted several hours, she said.

An online resume under Soliman’s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.”

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

The violence comes four years after a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver, that killed 10 people. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall area were evacuated by police. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear of the mall.

Tucker reported from Washington. Associated Press journalists Brittany Peterson and David Zalubowski in Boulder, Colorado; Kimberlee Kruesi in Providence, Rhode Island; Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis; Alanna Durkin Richer and Michael Biesecker in Washington and Jim Mustian in New York contributed to this report.","The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group,” the FBI said."

What had been a peaceful rally at the Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall on Sunday in solidarity with hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza quickly turned into a scene of horror, with medical crews arriving to find victims lying or sitting on the ground with their legs and bodies burned – and police holding a suspect face down with a gun at his back.

Members of the public raced from local restaurants with buckets and jugs of water to pour over those who were injured.

The attack by a man hurling molotov cocktails and shouting “Free Palestine” struck at the heart of one of Colorado’s largest Jewish communities, just 10 days after two Israeli embassy staffers were shot dead in Washington DC by a man yelling the same statement. It also came weeks after an arson attack on the home of Josh Shapiro, the Jewish governor of Pennsylvania, by a pro-Palestinian activist.

“Make no mistake: if and when Jews are targeted to protest Israel’s actions, it should clearly and unequivocally be understood and condemned as antisemitism,” Amy Spitalnick, chief executive of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement.

“These attacks come alongside a broader rise in antisemitism, from hate crimes targeting Jews walking down the street, to efforts to marginalize, isolate, and discriminate against Jews, to antisemitic and white supremacist mass violence targeting synagogues and other spaces.”

Boulder county, where Sunday’s attack took place, had long been considered a safe, “dream community” for Jewish families drawn there over the last decade. Numbers have doubled to represent more than 10% of the county’s 330,000 population.

The eight victims – four men and four women, including an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, and a mother and daughter – represented a cross-section of a vibrant diaspora in a city with numerous Jewish community centers, schools and businesses.

“What happened here in our local community in Boulder is shameful, and I think people really need to have a sense of accountability,” Fred Greene, rabbi of Boulder’s Har HaShem congregation, told CNN on Monday.

“If we want peace, if we want dignity for people, there have to be other ways than this kind of violence.”

Another expert, University of Boulder Hillel executive director Elyana Funk, told the network that the assault was especially shocking because it targeted a “quiet and respectful” assembly of residents who were taking part in a solidarity walk, which has become popular in numerous Jewish communities around the world since the Hamas terror attack on Israel and taking of hostages on 7 October 2023.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” she said. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

The attack came on the same day as the start of Shavuot, a two-day Jewish festival to celebrate the 50th day after the Passover holiday. Several events were postponed or canceled after the attack, but Funk said resilience would shine through.

“The antidote for antisemitism can be Jewish joy, and Jewish community and Jewish connection,” she said.

Meanwhile, the Boulder police chief, Stephen Redfearn, recalled the community reaction to the 2021 mass shooting at a supermarket in the city that left 10 people dead.

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy sadly and I know a lot of people are scared right now and questioning how this happened and why,” he said at a press conference on Sunday night.

“Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover. I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive.”

The attack took place on Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian area of downtown Boulder laced with stores and restaurants, overlooked by the University of Colorado, and a regular venue for the event supporting Run for Their Lives, an organization calling for the immediate release of the Gaza hostages.

Eyewitnesses said the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, appeared out of nowhere and seemingly singled out individuals taking part in the rally.

“It was easily the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Brian Horowitz, 37, told CNN.

The Denver resident said he was in a cafe with his family when he heard screams and raced to confront the suspect, who was shouting profanities at his victims.

“‘Fuck you Zionists,” Horowitz said the man yelled. “‘You’re killing my people so I kill you.’”

Horowitz added: “There’s someone who is outraged enough to go and attack these elderly people who are doing absolutely nothing to provoke it other than walk in silence and meet in a courtyard peacefully.

CO Gov. Polis Gets Self-Awareness Checked After Condemning Boulder Terror Attack,"In Boulder, Colorado a man yelling ""free Palestine"" used what was called a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails in an antisemitic terrorist attack, but initially the city's police chief wouldn't call it a terror attack:

🚨 WTF?! Boulder Police are REFUSING to call the attack on pro-Israel marchers an “act of terror” Even though the attacker threw MOLOTOV COCKTAILS while shouting FREE PALESTINE. Gee, I wonder what the motive was??! 🙄 pic.twitter.com/pHzUXrmYLr

The authorities said they were investigating an attack in Boulder, Colo., on Sunday as an act of terrorism, after a man used a “makeshift flamethrower” to attack demonstrators marching peacefully in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Eight people were hospitalized with burns and other injuries, and two of them were in serious condition, officials said. The suspect, who the Department of Homeland Security identified as an Egyptian citizen who had overstayed his tourist visa, was arrested. The attack may intensify deep unease in the Jewish community in the United States. In recent months, two Israeli embassy aides were murdered in Washington, and a man set fire to the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who is Jewish.

The ""Egyptian citizen who had overstayed his tourist visa"" translates to ""he was in the U.S. illegally,"" but the New York Times couldn't bring themselves to put it that way. And this makes it even more maddening:

The previous administration, from Biden to Harris to Mayorkas, has an incredible amount of blood on their hands.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis runs a sanctuary state and said this attack is ""unfathomable"":

Well, knowing Democrats policies these days it's actually quite fathomable.

Here's a 2019 tweet from Polis that sums up the Dem mindset (and the horrific consequences that can follow):

People in the country illegally are by definition criminals. So yes, Colorado has become a ""sanctuary state for criminals"" on Polis' watch.

With help from Biden, Harris and Mayorkas.

The big problem is that by the time somebody in the country illegally becomes a criminal by Polis' definition, it's too late for the victims.",

“There is a male with a blow torch setting people on fire,” a dispatcher advised the city’s police department, passing on the account of an eyewitness. Another official reported: “Multiple burns, potential terror attack.”

What had been a peaceful rally at the Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall on Sunday in solidarity with hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza quickly turned into a scene of horror, with medical crews arriving to find victims lying or sitting on the ground with their legs and bodies burned – and police holding a suspect face down with a gun at his back.

Members of the public raced from local restaurants with buckets and jugs of water to pour over those who were injured.

Related: Suspect charged with hate crime in attack on Colorado rally for Israeli hostages

The attack by a man hurling molotov cocktails and shouting “Free Palestine” struck at the heart of one of Colorado’s largest Jewish communities, just 10 days after two Israeli embassy staffers were shot dead in Washington DC by a man yelling the same statement. It also came weeks after an arson attack on the home of Josh Shapiro, the Jewish governor of Pennsylvania, by a pro-Palestinian activist.

“Make no mistake: if and when Jews are targeted to protest Israel’s actions, it should clearly and unequivocally be understood and condemned as antisemitism,” Amy Spitalnick, chief executive of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement.

“These attacks come alongside a broader rise in antisemitism, from hate crimes targeting Jews walking down the street, to efforts to marginalize, isolate, and discriminate against Jews, to antisemitic and white supremacist mass violence targeting synagogues and other spaces.”

Boulder county, where Sunday’s attack took place, had long been considered a safe, “dream community” for Jewish families drawn there over the last decade. Numbers have doubled to represent more than 10% of the county’s 330,000 population.

The eight victims – four men and four women, including an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, and a mother and daughter – represented a cross-section of a vibrant diaspora in a city with numerous Jewish community centers, schools and businesses.

“What happened here in our local community in Boulder is shameful, and I think people really need to have a sense of accountability,” Fred Greene, rabbi of Boulder’s Har HaShem congregation, told CNN on Monday.

“If we want peace, if we want dignity for people, there have to be other ways than this kind of violence.”

Trump implores New Jersey voters to back governor candidate Jack Ciattarelli in primary

The president announced his endorsement for Ciattarelli last month but held a telephone rally for the candidate Monday ahead of the start early in-person voting on Tuesday. The phone call lasted about 10 minutes, with the president saying that voters will decide whether the state remains a “high tax, high crime sanctuary state.”

“New Jersey is ready to pop out of that blue horror show and really get in there and vote for somebody that’s going to make things happen,” the president said.

Ciattarelli said his first executive order if elected would be ending any sanctuary policies for immigrants in the country illegally. Currently, the state attorney general has directed local law enforcement not to assist federal agents in civil immigration matters.

Ciattarelli is running against former radio talk host Bill Spadea, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and a southern New Jersey contractor named Justin Barbera.

Trump and Senate budget hawks talk privately over increasing cuts in GOP tax bill

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said he’d spoken with Trump recently about the bill after his promise that at least four senators were willing to hold the bill unless steeper cuts to the deficit were made.

“My main sticking point is the debt ceiling. If they strip the debt ceiling off, there’s a lot of things I would vote for,” said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Paul said that he told Trump this would be the first time in recent history that Republicans would “own” the debt ceiling if an increase of the nation’s debt limit was included in the GOP’s sweeping tax and spending package.

“My target for the next fiscal year (is) $6.5 trillion,” said Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. Senators, Scott said, must “go line by line through the budget” to achieve “pre-pandemic levels of spending.” Scott added that he’d recently conveyed this to Trump.

Harvard lawyers ask judge to rule whether health research grants were lawfully ended

Attorneys representing the Ivy League institution filed a motion for summary judgement in its lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Massachusetts U.S. District Court on Monday, asserting that the Trump administration’s freeze of billions of dollars in grants “flagrantly violates the First Amendment multiple times over.”

“The Government’s across-the-board freeze and terminations are unreasonable and unreasoned,” the motion filed by Harvard reads, going on to say that the Trump administration asserts antisemitism concerns “as the basis for its actions but fails to explain how the termination of funding for research to treat cancer, support veterans, and improve national security addresses antisemitism.”

Harvard attorneys said the institution has been at the forefront of health research for 400 years.

“All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard was clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your viewpoints and your academic institution or jeopardize your ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,” attorneys wrote.

GOP senators are waiting on Trump before launching Russian sanctions package

Sen. Markwayne Mullin says Congress is ready to slap sanctions on Russia to push an end to the Ukraine war — as soon as Trump says so.

“We are prepared to move forward as soon as they feel like it’s the timing’s right,” the Oklahoma Republican said.

He said, “We don’t want to get in front of the White House. We want to work with them.”

Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham has been overseas working to build momentum for the sanctions on Putin’s regime. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said earlier that the White House is still working toward a deal to end the war.

Trump is talking to GOP senators about Medicaid cuts and taxes in the big bill

GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri says Trump told him in a call he “wants to make sure” the Senate doesn’t cut Medicaid benefits.

The Missouri Republican has been working to strip steep health care cuts in the House bill, beyond work requirements for some aid recipients.

Hawley said Trump told him the senators could instead raise revenue by closing the so-called carried interest tax loophole used by wealthy filers.

U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau was getting in some golf practice on a famous green Monday at the South Lawn of the White House, according to a video posted by a White House aide.

DeChambeau, who golfed on Sunday with President Donald Trump at his club in Virginia, returned to the White House with the president Sunday and appeared to stick around Monday, when he used the putting green on the South Lawn.

The putting green was first installed in 1954 during President Dwight Eisenhower’s administration. It was removed in 1971, later restored in a different location by former President George H.W. Bush and moved to its current spot under President Bill Clinton.

His stare is intent. His coiffure has been swept to his right side. The lighting is dramatic with a mix of shadows that depart from the brighter photographs of his predecessors. An American flag pin gleams in his lapel.

On the Monday social media post announcing the portrait, the White House used a flame emoji to describe the picture. The posting on X featured a video of a suited man hanging the framed picture on the wall to the soundtrack of an Austin Powers-like jazz riff as people walked by, giving the picture a look of stillness and permanence.

Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune met at the White House at a critical moment Monday as senators returned to begin negotiations over the president’s big tax breaks and spending cuts package.

Thune said that GOP senators are “on track” to have the package approved by their July 4 deadline.

But Thune also acknowledged the long road ahead as senators grind through private talks over changes to put its own stamp on the House-passed bill.

More white South Africans arrive in the US under new refugee program

Nine people, including families, arrived late last week, said Jaco Kleynhans, head of international liaison at the Solidarity Movement, a group representing members of South Africa’s white Afrikaner minority. An initial group of 59 white South Africans arrived in Virginia on last month.

The program announced in February fast-tracks the resettlement of white South Africans after the Trump administration indefinitely suspended other refugee programs.

The administration said it is offering refugee status to white South Africans it alleges are being persecuted by their Black-led government and are victims of racially motivated violence. The South African government has denied the allegations and said they are a mischaracterization of the country.

RFK Jr. says autism ‘destroys’ families. Here’s what those families want you to know

Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems. The 16-year-old’s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her verses. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger.

Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy’s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism.

Kennedy has said the developmental disorder ”destroys families.” He said children with autism “will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”

For some people with autism, his comments were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability.

U.S. District Judge John Holcomb, who was appointed in 2019 by Trump, ruled that the administration is not providing due process rights to people it accuses of belonging to a Venezuelan gang against which Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law.

Holcomb temporarily halted removals of people in central California targeted under Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He joins judges in New York, Texas, Colorado and Pennsylvania in temporarily freezing deportations under the act.

Holcomb did find that Trump’s invocation of the act was proper. That’s in contrast to some other judges who ruled it cannot be used against a gang.

Trump says ‘horrific’ Colorado attack ‘WILL NOT BE TOLERATED’ in US

Trump says the “horrific” attack in Boulder, Colorado, “WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America” and suggested it was the fault of his predecessor’s immigration policies.

In a post on his social media site, Trump wrote, that the suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, “came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” – even though the details surrounding Soliman aren’t entirely clear.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after having entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. B2 is generally a non-immigrant, temporary tourist visa.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired.

Trump and Xi set to talk this week about trade challenges

Trump is “likely” to talk this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says.

The two leaders are slated to talk as trade tensions have intensified after both nations agreed in May to reduce tariffs for a 90-day negotiation period. But the U.S. is displeased with problems over China exporting critical minerals, while China is frustrated by U.S. efforts to limit their access to advanced computer chips.

Leavitt told reporters that the White House would provide a readout of the call between Trump and Xi.

Pennsylvania senators mostly agree during forum on bipartisanship, and politely disagree

Pennsylvania’s two U.S. senators, Democrat John Fetterman and Republican David McCormick sat on Monday for 30 minutes to take questions from Shannon Bream, anchor of Fox News Sunday, at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston as part of an effort to promote bipartisanship.

They found it easy to agree on certain questions, such as foreign policy, and politely disagreed on others, including President Trump’s tax breaks, spending cuts and border security bill.

Fetterman says he won’t support cuts to Medicaid and food aid. McCormick stresses the need for tax relief, spending cuts and border security. But he also says they agree that the federal government shouldn’t take benefits away from vulnerable people.

Fetterman and McCormick have struck up a friendship following McCormick’s victory last November over longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, Fetterman’s mentor in the Senate. Fetterman has had something of a warm embrace from Republicans over his ideological split with Democrats on Israel and border policy.

On foreign policy, both men are strong backers of Israel in its war against Hamas and preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, even if it means Israel striking Iran’s nuclear facilities to destroy them.

Trump administration lawyers have filed emergency appeals with the nation’s highest court a little less than once a week on average since Trump began his second term.

The court is not being asked to render a final decision but rather to set the rules of the road while the case makes it way through the courts.

The justices have issued orders in 11 cases so far, and the Trump administration has won more than it has lost.

Among the administration’s victories was an order allowing it to enforce the Republican president’s ban of on transgender military service members. Among its losses was a prohibition on using an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans alleged to be gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that’s languished for years.

The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska.

The three officials are appearing at an energy conference convened by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and at events with industry representatives and Alaska Native leaders who support drilling.

Trump lashes out at Leonard Leo and Federalist Society

Trump has lashed out at Leonard Leo, the conservative legal activist who has worked to dramatically reshape the country’s courts.

Trump is blaming Leo and the group he used to head for encouraging him to appoint judges who are now blocking his agenda. Leo is the former longtime leader of the conservative Federalist Society, who, during Trump’s first term, helped the president transform the federal judiciary and closely advised him on his Supreme Court picks.

He is widely credited as an architect of the conservative majority responsible for overturning Roe v. Wade.

Can Trump fix the US debt?

President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won’t bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised.

The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add $5.1 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if they are allowed to continue. That’s according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.

Spike in steel tariffs could imperil Trump promise of lower grocery prices

President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles.

The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on those imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they’re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.

“Rising grocery prices would be part of the ripple effects,” says Usha Haley, an expert on trade and professor at Wichita State University, who added that the tariffs could raise costs across industries and further strain ties with allies “without aiding a long-term U.S. manufacturing revival.”

Trump’s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away, in such a whiplash-inducing frenzy it’s hard to keep up. He insisted the latest tariff hike was necessary to “even further secure the steel industry in the U.S.”

Trump withdrawing the nomination of Musk associate to lead NASA

Trump says he is withdrawing the nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, an associate of Trump adviser Elon Musk, to lead NASA, saying he reached the decision after a “thorough review” of Isaacman’s “prior associations.”

It was unclear what Trump meant and the White House did not respond to an emailed request for an explanation.

“After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA,” Trump wrote late Saturday on his social media site. “I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space.”","President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won’t bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax-break package."

For some people with autism, his comments were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability.

U.S. District Judge John Holcomb, who was appointed in 2019 by Trump, ruled that the administration is not providing due process rights to people it accuses of belonging to a Venezuelan gang against which Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law.

Holcomb temporarily halted removals of people in central California targeted under Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He joins judges in New York, Texas, Colorado and Pennsylvania in temporarily freezing deportations under the act.

Holcomb did find that Trump’s invocation of the act was proper. That’s in contrast to some other judges who ruled it cannot be used against a gang.

Trump says ‘horrific’ Colorado attack ‘WILL NOT BE TOLERATED’ in US

Trump says the “horrific” attack in Boulder, Colorado, “WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America” and suggested it was the fault of his predecessor’s immigration policies.

In a post on his social media site, Trump wrote, that the suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, “came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” – even though the details surrounding Soliman aren’t entirely clear.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after having entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X. B2 is generally a non-immigrant, temporary tourist visa.

McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired.

Trump and Xi set to talk this week about trade challenges

Trump is “likely” to talk this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says.

The two leaders are slated to talk as trade tensions have intensified after both nations agreed in May to reduce tariffs for a 90-day negotiation period. But the U.S. is displeased with problems over China exporting critical minerals, while China is frustrated by U.S. efforts to limit their access to advanced computer chips.

Leavitt told reporters that the White House would provide a readout of the call between Trump and Xi.

Pennsylvania senators mostly agree during forum on bipartisanship, and politely disagree

Pennsylvania’s two U.S. senators, Democrat John Fetterman and Republican David McCormick sat on Monday for 30 minutes to take questions from Shannon Bream, anchor of Fox News Sunday, at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute in Boston as part of an effort to promote bipartisanship.

They found it easy to agree on certain questions, such as foreign policy, and politely disagreed on others, including President Trump’s tax breaks, spending cuts and border security bill.

Fetterman says he won’t support cuts to Medicaid and food aid. McCormick stresses the need for tax relief, spending cuts and border security. But he also says they agree that the federal government shouldn’t take benefits away from vulnerable people.

Fetterman and McCormick have struck up a friendship following McCormick’s victory last November over longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, Fetterman’s mentor in the Senate. Fetterman has had something of a warm embrace from Republicans over his ideological split with Democrats on Israel and border policy.

On foreign policy, both men are strong backers of Israel in its war against Hamas and preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, even if it means Israel striking Iran’s nuclear facilities to destroy them.

Trump administration lawyers have filed emergency appeals with the nation’s highest court a little less than once a week on average since Trump began his second term.

The court is not being asked to render a final decision but rather to set the rules of the road while the case makes it way through the courts.

The justices have issued orders in 11 cases so far, and the Trump administration has won more than it has lost.

Among the administration’s victories was an order allowing it to enforce the Republican president’s ban of on transgender military service members. Among its losses was a prohibition on using an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans alleged to be gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that’s languished for years.

The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska.

The three officials are appearing at an energy conference convened by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and at events with industry representatives and Alaska Native leaders who support drilling.

Trump lashes out at Leonard Leo and Federalist Society

Trump has lashed out at Leonard Leo, the conservative legal activist who has worked to dramatically reshape the country’s courts.

Trump is blaming Leo and the group he used to head for encouraging him to appoint judges who are now blocking his agenda. Leo is the former longtime leader of the conservative Federalist Society, who, during Trump’s first term, helped the president transform the federal judiciary and closely advised him on his Supreme Court picks.

He is widely credited as an architect of the conservative majority responsible for overturning Roe v. Wade.

Can Trump fix the US debt?

President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won’t bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.

The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised.

The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add $5.1 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if they are allowed to continue. That’s according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.

Spike in steel tariffs could imperil Trump promise of lower grocery prices

President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles.

The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on those imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they’re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.

“Rising grocery prices would be part of the ripple effects,” says Usha Haley, an expert on trade and professor at Wichita State University, who added that the tariffs could raise costs across industries and further strain ties with allies “without aiding a long-term U.S. manufacturing revival.”

Trump’s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away, in such a whiplash-inducing frenzy it’s hard to keep up. He insisted the latest tariff hike was necessary to “even further secure the steel industry in the U.S.”

Trump withdrawing the nomination of Musk associate to lead NASA

Trump says he is withdrawing the nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, an associate of Trump adviser Elon Musk, to lead NASA, saying he reached the decision after a “thorough review” of Isaacman’s “prior associations.”

It was unclear what Trump meant and the White House did not respond to an emailed request for an explanation.

“After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA,” Trump wrote late Saturday on his social media site. “I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space.”","President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won’t bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax-break package."

Financial markets have remained skeptical, as the deficit continues to grow despite Trump’s promises to curb spending.

Trump implores New Jersey voters to back governor candidate Jack Ciattarelli in primary

The president announced his endorsement for Ciattarelli last month but held a telephone rally for the candidate Monday ahead of the start early in-person voting on Tuesday. The phone call lasted about 10 minutes, with the president saying that voters will decide whether the state remains a “high tax, high crime sanctuary state.”

“New Jersey is ready to pop out of that blue horror show and really get in there and vote for somebody that’s going to make things happen,” the president said.

Ciattarelli said his first executive order if elected would be ending any sanctuary policies for immigrants in the country illegally. Currently, the state attorney general has directed local law enforcement not to assist federal agents in civil immigration matters.

Ciattarelli is running against former radio talk host Bill Spadea, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and a southern New Jersey contractor named Justin Barbera.

Trump and Senate budget hawks talk privately over increasing cuts in GOP tax bill

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said he’d spoken with Trump recently about the bill after his promise that at least four senators were willing to hold the bill unless steeper cuts to the deficit were made.

“My main sticking point is the debt ceiling. If they strip the debt ceiling off, there’s a lot of things I would vote for,” said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Paul said that he told Trump this would be the first time in recent history that Republicans would “own” the debt ceiling if an increase of the nation’s debt limit was included in the GOP’s sweeping tax and spending package.

“My target for the next fiscal year (is) $6.5 trillion,” said Sen. Rick Scott of Florida. Senators, Scott said, must “go line by line through the budget” to achieve “pre-pandemic levels of spending.” Scott added that he’d recently conveyed this to Trump.

Harvard lawyers ask judge to rule whether health research grants were lawfully ended

Attorneys representing the Ivy League institution filed a motion for summary judgement in its lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Massachusetts U.S. District Court on Monday, asserting that the Trump administration’s freeze of billions of dollars in grants “flagrantly violates the First Amendment multiple times over.”

“The Government’s across-the-board freeze and terminations are unreasonable and unreasoned,” the motion filed by Harvard reads, going on to say that the Trump administration asserts antisemitism concerns “as the basis for its actions but fails to explain how the termination of funding for research to treat cancer, support veterans, and improve national security addresses antisemitism.”

Harvard attorneys said the institution has been at the forefront of health research for 400 years.

“All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard was clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your viewpoints and your academic institution or jeopardize your ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,” attorneys wrote.

GOP senators are waiting on Trump before launching Russian sanctions package

Sen. Markwayne Mullin says Congress is ready to slap sanctions on Russia to push an end to the Ukraine war — as soon as Trump says so.

“We are prepared to move forward as soon as they feel like it’s the timing’s right,” the Oklahoma Republican said.

He said, “We don’t want to get in front of the White House. We want to work with them.”

Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham has been overseas working to build momentum for the sanctions on Putin’s regime. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said earlier that the White House is still working toward a deal to end the war.

Trump is talking to GOP senators about Medicaid cuts and taxes in the big bill

GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri says Trump told him in a call he “wants to make sure” the Senate doesn’t cut Medicaid benefits.

The Missouri Republican has been working to strip steep health care cuts in the House bill, beyond work requirements for some aid recipients.

Hawley said Trump told him the senators could instead raise revenue by closing the so-called carried interest tax loophole used by wealthy filers.

U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau was getting in some golf practice on a famous green Monday at the South Lawn of the White House, according to a video posted by a White House aide.

DeChambeau, who golfed on Sunday with President Donald Trump at his club in Virginia, returned to the White House with the president Sunday and appeared to stick around Monday, when he used the putting green on the South Lawn.

The putting green was first installed in 1954 during President Dwight Eisenhower’s administration. It was removed in 1971, later restored in a different location by former President George H.W. Bush and moved to its current spot under President Bill Clinton.

His stare is intent. His coiffure has been swept to his right side. The lighting is dramatic with a mix of shadows that depart from the brighter photographs of his predecessors. An American flag pin gleams in his lapel.

On the Monday social media post announcing the portrait, the White House used a flame emoji to describe the picture. The posting on X featured a video of a suited man hanging the framed picture on the wall to the soundtrack of an Austin Powers-like jazz riff as people walked by, giving the picture a look of stillness and permanence.

Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune met at the White House at a critical moment Monday as senators returned to begin negotiations over the president’s big tax breaks and spending cuts package.

Thune said that GOP senators are “on track” to have the package approved by their July 4 deadline.

But Thune also acknowledged the long road ahead as senators grind through private talks over changes to put its own stamp on the House-passed bill.

More white South Africans arrive in the US under new refugee program

Nine people, including families, arrived late last week, said Jaco Kleynhans, head of international liaison at the Solidarity Movement, a group representing members of South Africa’s white Afrikaner minority. An initial group of 59 white South Africans arrived in Virginia on last month.

The program announced in February fast-tracks the resettlement of white South Africans after the Trump administration indefinitely suspended other refugee programs.

The administration said it is offering refugee status to white South Africans it alleges are being persecuted by their Black-led government and are victims of racially motivated violence. The South African government has denied the allegations and said they are a mischaracterization of the country.

RFK Jr. says autism ‘destroys’ families. Here’s what those families want you to know

Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems. The 16-year-old’s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her verses. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger.

Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy’s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism.

Kennedy has said the developmental disorder ”destroys families.” He said children with autism “will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”

Donald Trump has been mocked on social media after his phone background was caught on camera during a press conference.

US President Donald Trump has been mocked after cameras caught a glimpse of his phone's lock screen, revealing a photo of himself. The image, which appears to be an AI-enhanced snap from his latest election campaign, has sparked a frenzy online.

Political commentator Harry Sisson shared his thoughts on TikTok, saying: ""Donald Trump was holding a press conference and his phone screen was seen. Can you take a guess as to what the lockscreen photo is? If you guess himself, you'd be absolutely right.""

Sisson quipped: ""Do you know how narcissistic you have to be to want yourself to be the home screen? You'd be constantly looking at yourself. Normal people might have a photo of themselves and others - family or friends - but no, in Donald Trump's world, it's a constant him.""

Sisson claimed this isn't out of character for Trump, who allegedly has a fondness for hanging portraits of himself on his walls, reports the Mirror. He added: ""He just loves admiring what he looks like, but it's very strange.""

The TikTok clip has racked up 71,000 likes and numerous comments, with one user saying: ""Narcissism on full display.""

Others joked about the possibility of Trump searching for and downloading the image himself, while another compared it to people who display portraits of themselves at home, calling it ""It's like people who have portraits of themselves hanging at home. It's so odd.""

While some criticised the image Donald Trump chose for his lock screen, others failed to see an issue.

Comments included, ""So? I have myself too its quite common actually.""

and queries like ""Is this a problem?"" Another pointed out, ""Lots of people do that, no?"".

Trump's preoccupation with his image is not new; he recently requested the removal of one of his Presidential portraits. In an outlandish tirade on TruthSocial, he lamented, ""Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves. But the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor... was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.""

He acknowledged artist Sarah Boardman for creating a ""wonderful"" portrait of Obama during his Presidency but slammed her efforts on his own depiction: ""He looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst.""

Mocking Boardman's abilities, Trump suggested, ""She must have lost her talent as she got older. In any event, I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one.""",Donald Trump has been mocked on social media after his phone background was caught on camera during a press conference.

The trial starts Monday morning with jury selection at Denver's Alfred A. Araj United States Courthouse. Opening statements are expected to be 30 minutes long and will likely be over by the end of the day.

The upcoming two-week trial, overseen by U.S. District Judge Nina Wang, stems from a defamation lawsuit filed in 2022 by Eric Coomer, a former Dominion Voting Systems employee, who alleges that Lindell accused him of rigging the 2020 election against President Trump during an “Antifa conference call.”

Lindell, who wants to see an end to voting machines in favor of paper ballots in U.S. elections, told The Rolling Stone that he's a former crack addict who ""has nothing to hide.""

Coomer, a Colorado resident who handled election security for Dominion, is suing Lindell and two of his companies, My Pillow, Inc and FrankSpeech LLC, now known as Lindell TV, for an undisclosed amount of money for allegedly ruining his reputation and causing him emotional distress when he claimed that Coomer threw the 2020 election.

This is not Coomer's lone lawsuit. He has filed a series of them against conservative figures alleging the same basic sequence of events, but the lawsuit against Lindell is the first to go to trial.

Coomer's claims originated with a November 2020 podcast recorded by Joe Oltmann, a Colorado podcaster and political activist .

Days after the presidential election, Oltmann alleged he had recently listened in on an ""antifa"" conference call — a reference to anti-fascist ideology.

On the call, an unnamed participant referenced ""Eric ... the Dominion guy."" Oltmann alleged ""Eric"" said, ""Don't worry about the election, (Donald) Trump is not gonna win. I made f-ing sure of that.”

Oltmann then conducted his own ""investigation"" by Googling the terms ""Eric,"" ""Dominion,"" and ""Colorado.""

Based on limited other information found online, he concluded Coomer was the one who allegedly made the comments of election rigging. Oltmann repeated his story publicly, even after the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency found ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”

Coomer sued Oltmann, media figures, Trump's 2020 campaign and Trump's lawyers after they amplified the unproven accusations. Coomer alleged receiving credible death threats and that he was forced to hide for fear of his safety as a result of the incendiary story.

Coomer and Lindell are expected to take the stand during what is expected to be an adversarial two-week trial. The witness list is a who’s who of Colorado election officials including embattled former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, Executive Director of the Colorado County Clerk’s Association Matt Crane and former Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams, according to court documents filed in April.

Lindell has spoken with President Donald Trump to discuss Peters' release from her 9-year prison sentence for giving supporters of Trump unauthorized access to the Mesa County election system in 2021 in an unsuccessful search for voter fraud.

Some of the testimony will revolve around the value of Coomer’s character when he was the director of product strategy and security for Dominion Voting Systems. In addition, Coomer’s psychiatrist will speak to his emotional suffering as a result of Lindell’s media campaign, which Coomer claims labeled him as a traitor, the motion said.

Kurt Olsen, a former attorney for President Trump and Lindell, is being called by both sides and will appear via video feed, court documents said.

Olsen’s role for the plaintiff is expected to be to reveal how speakers at the 2021 Cyber Symposium were coordinated. On the other hand, Lindell’s attorneys will question him about how much he knew and whether he things Lindell intended to cause the damages Coomer alleges, according to court documents.

Other witnesses include the podcaster, Oltmann, and Chris Ruddy, the CEO of the conservative television network Newsmax, according to court documents.

Four years ago, when Newsmax was facing a defamation lawsuit of its own, the company publicly apologized to Coomer and backed off claims that he manipulated voting machines and counts to thwart President Trump’s re-election. In a statement Newsmax said it “found

no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way, nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so,"" it said in a statement."" There has been no evidence that the election was rigged.”

In the Denver trial, Coomer's attorneys are expected to introduce a live-streamed Cyber Symposium which Lindell organized and led in 2021 to showcase his claims of 2020 election fraud. At the August 2021 Sioux Falls, South Dakota event, Lindell said that he had irrefutable evidence of election hacking and manipulation, particularly by foreign entities.

At the event, Coomer was painted as an insider who had access to and manipulated election levers during the 2020 election. In a motion filed in April, Coomer’s attorneys say they plan to prove that Lindell made up those claims, that the claims were intentional and malicious, and that Coomer suffered emotional distress and because of them.

In response, Lindell countered that the claims were not malicious, that he did not knowingly act reckless with no regard for the truth and added that Coomer’s claims of injury were exaggerated.

He has stated in media interviews that he did not know Coomer and wonders why Coomer picked on him.

Though President Trump and his attorneys have claimed election fraud through the introduction of more than 60 lawsuits in the United States, none of them have come up with enough evidence to prove that Coomer, Dominion or anyone else involved with vote-counting have changed election results.

The trial starts Monday morning with jury selection at Denver's Alfred A. Araj United States Courthouse. Opening statements are expected to be 30 minutes long and will likely be over by the end of the day.

The upcoming two-week trial, overseen by U.S. District Judge Nina Wang, stems from a defamation lawsuit filed in 2022 by Eric Coomer, a former Dominion Voting Systems employee, who alleges that Lindell accused him of rigging the 2020 election against President Trump during an “Antifa conference call.”

Lindell, who wants to see an end to voting machines in favor of paper ballots in U.S. elections, told The Rolling Stone that he's a former crack addict who ""has nothing to hide.""

Coomer, a Colorado resident who handled election security for Dominion, is suing Lindell and two of his companies, My Pillow, Inc and FrankSpeech LLC, now known as Lindell TV, for an undisclosed amount of money for allegedly ruining his reputation and causing him emotional distress when he claimed that Coomer threw the 2020 election.

This is not Coomer's lone lawsuit. He has filed a series of them against conservative figures alleging the same basic sequence of events, but the lawsuit against Lindell is the first to go to trial.

Coomer's claims originated with a November 2020 podcast recorded by Joe Oltmann, a Colorado podcaster and political activist .

Days after the presidential election, Oltmann alleged he had recently listened in on an ""antifa"" conference call — a reference to anti-fascist ideology.

On the call, an unnamed participant referenced ""Eric ... the Dominion guy."" Oltmann alleged ""Eric"" said, ""Don't worry about the election, (Donald) Trump is not gonna win. I made f-ing sure of that.”

Oltmann then conducted his own ""investigation"" by Googling the terms ""Eric,"" ""Dominion,"" and ""Colorado.""

Based on limited other information found online, he concluded Coomer was the one who allegedly made the comments of election rigging. Oltmann repeated his story publicly, even after the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency found ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”

Coomer sued Oltmann, media figures, Trump's 2020 campaign and Trump's lawyers after they amplified the unproven accusations. Coomer alleged receiving credible death threats and that he was forced to hide for fear of his safety as a result of the incendiary story.

Coomer and Lindell are expected to take the stand during what is expected to be an adversarial two-week trial. The witness list is a who’s who of Colorado election officials including embattled former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, Executive Director of the Colorado County Clerk’s Association Matt Crane and former Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams, according to court documents filed in April.

Lindell has spoken with President Donald Trump to discuss Peters' release from her 9-year prison sentence for giving supporters of Trump unauthorized access to the Mesa County election system in 2021 in an unsuccessful search for voter fraud.

Some of the testimony will revolve around the value of Coomer’s character when he was the director of product strategy and security for Dominion Voting Systems. In addition, Coomer’s psychiatrist will speak to his emotional suffering as a result of Lindell’s media campaign, which Coomer claims labeled him as a traitor, the motion said.

Kurt Olsen, a former attorney for President Trump and Lindell, is being called by both sides and will appear via video feed, court documents said.

Olsen’s role for the plaintiff is expected to be to reveal how speakers at the 2021 Cyber Symposium were coordinated. On the other hand, Lindell’s attorneys will question him about how much he knew and whether he things Lindell intended to cause the damages Coomer alleges, according to court documents.

Other witnesses include the podcaster, Oltmann, and Chris Ruddy, the CEO of the conservative television network Newsmax, according to court documents.

Four years ago, when Newsmax was facing a defamation lawsuit of its own, the company publicly apologized to Coomer and backed off claims that he manipulated voting machines and counts to thwart President Trump’s re-election. In a statement Newsmax said it “found

no evidence that Dr. Coomer interfered with Dominion voting machines or voting software in any way, nor that Dr. Coomer ever claimed to have done so,"" it said in a statement."" There has been no evidence that the election was rigged.”

In the Denver trial, Coomer's attorneys are expected to introduce a live-streamed Cyber Symposium which Lindell organized and led in 2021 to showcase his claims of 2020 election fraud. At the August 2021 Sioux Falls, South Dakota event, Lindell said that he had irrefutable evidence of election hacking and manipulation, particularly by foreign entities.

At the event, Coomer was painted as an insider who had access to and manipulated election levers during the 2020 election. In a motion filed in April, Coomer’s attorneys say they plan to prove that Lindell made up those claims, that the claims were intentional and malicious, and that Coomer suffered emotional distress and because of them.

In response, Lindell countered that the claims were not malicious, that he did not knowingly act reckless with no regard for the truth and added that Coomer’s claims of injury were exaggerated.

He has stated in media interviews that he did not know Coomer and wonders why Coomer picked on him.

Though President Trump and his attorneys have claimed election fraud through the introduction of more than 60 lawsuits in the United States, none of them have come up with enough evidence to prove that Coomer, Dominion or anyone else involved with vote-counting have changed election results.

Lindell, once a self-made multi-millionaire, told a court in Washington D.C. in a different case separate from Coomer’s lawsuit that he is out of money. “I borrowed everything I can. Nobody will lend me any money anymore,” he told the court. “I’m in ruins.”

It was the latest incident being investigated by federal authorities as domestic terrorism.

The U.S. has seen an increase in antisemitic attacks and violent pro-Palestinian protests amid the war between Israel and Hamas.

But the incidents of domestic terrorism aren’t limited to antisemitism. Extremists who hold anti-American sentiment have attempted attacks on vehicles, military bases and more.

Here is a breakdown of the domestic terrorism incidents in the U.S. in 2025:

Boulder, Colorado, Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said his department received reports early Sunday afternoon of a man with a weapon and people being set on fire on Pearl Street. A male suspect with minor injuries was taken into police custody at the scene, Redfearn said.

Suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman is now facing murder, assault and other charges following what the FBI called a ""targeted terror attack"" in Boulder, Colorado.

The violence against a pro-Israel group advocating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages left eight people, ages 52 to 88, with injuries, including one in critical condition, according to the FBI. Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with a weapon setting people on fire.

SUSPECT IN BOULDER TERROR ATTACK DETERMINED TO BE EGYPTIAN MAN IN US ILLEGALLY: FBI

""Run for Their Lives,"" was the organization hosting the event. The group organizes run and walk events calling for the immediate release of all hostages being held captive by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Soliman was charged with murder in the first degree — deliberation with intent; murder in the first degree — extreme indifference; crimes against at-risk adults/elderly; 1st degree assault — non-family; 1st degree assault — heat of passion; criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies; and use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony.

Soliman was also in the United States illegally, Fox News has learned. Soliman is an Egyptian national who came into the country two years ago and overstayed his visa.

Boulder Police Department confirmed Monday that no victims have died.

Soliman was booked into the Boulder County, Colorado, jail Sunday evening and remains held on a $10 million bond.

On Wednesday, May 21, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, two staffers of the Embassy of Israel to the U.S. — a couple set to be engaged — were shot and killed as they left the museum’s event focused on finding humanitarian solutions for Gaza.

Lischinsky was born in Israel and grew up in Germany. His father is Jewish, and his mother is Christian. Milgrim was an American employee of the embassy.

TWO ISRAELI DIPLOMATS SHOT, KILLED DURING EVENT AT CAPITAL JEWISH MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON, DC

Authorities took Elias Rodriguez, a 31-year-old man from Chicago, into custody. Upon being taken into custody, Rodriguez began shouting, ""Free, free Palestine!""

The FBI is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime and investigating any ties to terrorism.

Steven Jensen, the assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington field office, said in a news conference that the federal law enforcement entity is working alongside the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to ""look into ties to potential terrorism or motivation based on a bias-based crime or a hate crime.""

On May 17, a bombing took place at a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. The bombing killed the suspect and injured four others.

Authorities identified the perpetrator of the incident as a 26-year-old suspect motivated by a fringe ideology known as ""pro-mortalism.""

""Pro-mortalism,"" a radical offshoot of anti-natalism, views human reproduction as inherently immoral and embraces death as a moral corrective.

According to federal and local law enforcement, the suspect targeted the American Reproductive Centers facility specifically to destroy human embryos stored on-site.

FBI IDENTIFIES IVF CLINIC BOMBER AS 'PRO-MORTALIST' WHO OPPOSED BIRTH WITHOUT CONSENT

Surveillance footage and online postings suggest he parked in the rear of the building to remain unnoticed, ingested drugs and then detonated an explosive device — killing himself in the process.

The FBI has classified the bombing as an act of domestic terrorism, citing the ideological motivation behind the violence.

Officials have said that it is the first high-profile case linked to the pro-mortalist ideology and are now monitoring it as a potential emerging threat. Authorities have urged families and communities to remain vigilant for signs of ideological extremism, especially among those who may feel disenfranchised.

In May, a former Michigan Army National Guard member, Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, 19, was arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting near the U.S. Army’s Tank-Automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) center at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan.

Said planned to carry out the attack on behalf of ISIS.

Said allegedly ""launched his drone in support of the attack plan"" and told an undercover FBI agent in the lead-up to the foiled plot he recommended that ""everyone have about seven magazines because you don’t want to be in there and run out of ammo,"" according to officials.

Said is now facing charges of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and distributing information related to a destructive device. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years per count if convicted.

The FBI disrupted the attempted attack, with FBI Director Kash Patel telling Fox News Digital that any individual targeting the U.S. military or conspiring with foreign terrorist organizations will be ""prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

""Let this be a warning: Anyone who targets our military or conspires with foreign terrorist organizations will be found, stopped and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Patel told Fox News Digital. ""I commend the men and women of the Joint Terrorism Task Force and our law enforcement partners for their continued dedication to protecting the American people.""

Since January, there have been a number of instances of vandalism, arson and targeted shootings against Tesla vehicles, dealerships, and charging stations across the nation.

Tesla vehicles and dealerships have been targeted nationwide amid Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been focused on slashing wasteful spending and fraud within the federal government. Musk is the co-founder and CEO of Tesla.

The FBI launched a task force to crack down on violent Tesla attacks.

FBI LAUNCHES TASK FORCE TO CRACK DOWN ON VIOLENT TESLA ATTACKS, MITIGATE THREATS

The FBI’s task force was created in conjunction with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and will coordinate investigative activity.

A threat tag has been created at the FBI to streamline reports and a command post at FBI headquarters has been created. It consists of a joint FBI/ATF task force to mitigate that threat stream.

Eight people were injured.

“What happened in Boulder, Colorado—an especially brutal targeting of elders—is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,” L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement.

Bass said she would convene an emergency meeting after the conclusion of Shavuot, a Jewish holiday that began at sundown on Sunday and ends Tuesday evening. “Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in this city,” she said.

Authorities said the attacker, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, targeted demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run for Their Lives, which organizes run and walk events to call for the immediate release of the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.

The group had gathered at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and University of Colorado Boulder students.

Soliman was shouting “Free Palestine,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office.

Four women and four men, ages 52 to 88, were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said. Soliman was arrested and taken to the hospital for treatment, but authorities didn’t elaborate on his injuries.

The FBI is investigating the attack as a targeted act of terrorism.

“This marks the second violent assault on Jewish and pro-Israel civilians in the U.S. in less than two weeks—a chilling escalation that cannot be dismissed as coincidence,” the L.A.-based Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement, referring to the slaying of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, D.C. on May 21. “Both attacks are the direct result of months of anti-Israel propaganda, moral equivocation, and silence in the face of raging antisemitism.”

Israel’s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others.

Israel’s military response has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

On Sunday night, Boulder County Jail booking records showed Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was booked on the following charges:
• Crimes against at risk adult/elderly > 70 – serious injury
• Murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent – non family – gun
• Murder in the first degree extreme indifference
• Explosives or incendiary devices use during felony – incendiary

Sunday’s attack occurred during a peaceful, weekly demonstration held by Run for Their Lives in Boulder. The group described itself as an apolitical organization that has the sole mission of “walking peacefully to raise awareness for the 58 hostages still held in captivity by Hamas in Gaza.”

The group reaffirmed its commitment to peacefully calling for the swift return of all the hostages.

Redfearn said that he was aware of national law enforcement calling the incident a “terror attack,” but said he would not speculate on motive during this early stage of the investigation.

The Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said it was supporting the county and prepared to provide resources as requested.

13th Street, which crosses the Pearl Street Mall, is a car-accessible road that crosses the walkable portion of the shopping area. The roadway borders the Boulder County Historic Courthouse and a few other county offices.

An official with the Department of Homeland Security said Soliman is in the U.S. illegally. He allegedly entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa, which expired in February 2023. DHS also said he filed for asylum in September 2022.

FOX News is reporting that DHS sources said Soliman was an Egyptian national.

Gov. Jared Polis released this statement following an attack on demonstrators in Boulder calling for the release of hostages in Gaza.

“My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community. Boulder is strong. We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community. I’ve spoken with Boulder Mayor Brockett, and my administration is working closely with local and federal law enforcement on this afternoon’s attack. I thank the first responders who ran to help the injured and ensure victims received medical attention needed and to apprehend the suspect. As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot. Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

FBI Acting Agent in Charge Mark Michalek said the incident is being investigated as an act of terror.

One man spoke to FOX31’s Jeremy Hubbard about the incident and said he was afraid of repercussions to his family.

“You see all these hate crimes that are going on around the country, things that are happening to Jews all around the country, and I’ve got two kids and despite my my initial instinct to run into this situation it’s once I was there, I realized how dangerous it was, which is one of the reasons why I didn’t go and and tackle this guy,” Brian told Hubbard. “But like I didn’t want to do anything that would affect my family.”

Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he had planned it for a year and targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”, the FBI said.

Eight people were injured in the attack in Colorado, some with burns, as a group was concluding a weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Witnesses reported the man shouted “Free Palestine” during the attack.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody on Sunday and told the police he would do it again. The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the Justice Department on Monday.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street shopping centre, a four-block area in central Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the US.

The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah, and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement on Monday saying he, his wife and the nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office.

In New York, the police department said it had upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

The eight victims who were wounded were aged between 52 and 88 and the injuries ranged from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding a weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails”, as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante, of San Diego, said he was having lunch when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Mr Osante, people can be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Mr Osante said had caught fire during the attack.

After the initial attack, Mr Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a petrol bomb, but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it.

The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video filmed by Mr Osante.

Law enforcement found more than a dozen unlit petrol bombs near where Soliman was arrested. Inside his car, officers found papers with the words “Israel”, “Palestine,” and “USAid”, the affidavit says.

Soliman told investigators he constructed homemade petrol bombs after doing research online and buying the ingredients. He drove to Boulder with the devices in his car and stopped on the way for fuel, according to the affidavit.

He said in his interview that his goal was to “kill all Zionists”, the FBI said, and that he targeted the group and knew they they would be assembled on Sunday afternoon.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Authorities said on Sunday they believed Soliman acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought.

He was also injured and was taken to hospital to be treated. Authorities did not give details of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

Soliman was living in the US illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

She added that Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorisation in March 2023 that had expired.

Public records listed him as living in a modest rented townhouse in Colorado Springs, where local media outlets reported federal law enforcement agents were on the scene on Sunday.

An online resume under Soliman’s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with previous employers listed as companies in Egypt.

Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic centre for Islamic and Arabic learning in Cairo.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans”.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said.","A man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device to attack a US group bringing attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza has been charged with a federal hate crime.

""When he threw the Molotov cocktails, SOLIMAN yelled ‘Free Palestine!’ and the Molotov cocktails ignited in the crowd of people, causing burn injuries to eight individuals,"" the federal complaint states.

Authorities located a black plastic container near the suspect while arresting Soliman and found ""at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Ball jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles"" inside the container, along with ""a backpack weed sprayer, potentially containing a flammable substance""

""The clear liquid in the glass bottles and weed sprayer were determined to be 87 octane gasoline, which was determined to contain xylene based on a field test,"" the complaint states.

Inside a vehicle registered to Soliman, authorities found a ""red material consistent with the rags found in the black plastic container; a red gas container; and paperwork with the words, ‘Israel,’ ‘Palestine,’ and ‘USAID,'"" according to federal authorities.

During an interview with law enforcement after the arrest, Soliman ""stated that he researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them.""

""He traveled to Boulder, Colorado, in his vehicle with the Molotov cocktails and threw two of the cocktails at individuals participating in a pro-Israel gathering,"" the complaint states. ""He also stated that he picked up gas at a gas station on the way to Boulder. He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead.""

He also allegedly stated ""he would do it…again.""

""He specifically targeted the ‘Zionist Group’ that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search. SOLIMAN knew that they planned to meet … Sunday, June 1 at 1pm. He arrived at approximately 12:55 p.m. and waited for them. Throughout the interview, SOLIMAN stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over ‘our land,’ which he explained to be Palestine. He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,"" the complaint states.

Police responded to the area after receiving reports of a man with a weapon setting people on fire.

""We are aware of and fully investigating a targeted terror attack "" FBI director Kash Patel said. ""Our agents and local law enforcement are on the scene already, and we will share updates as more information becomes available.""

Soliman was living in the United States illegally after entering on a work visa two years ago that has since expired, according to federal officials.

Soliman was booked into the Boulder County Jail on Sunday evening and remains held on a $10 million bond.

The suspect in custody, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is accused of using a makeshift flamethrower to attack a group of people who were protesting in support of the Gaza Strip hostages who were abducted from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Fox News has reported that Soliman was an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa, but those details have yet to be confirmed by law enforcement. Stephen Miller, Trump’s top national security adviser, said on X that the suspect overstayed a tourist visa and was subsequently granted a work permit under the Biden administration.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social. “He came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under ‘TRUMP’ Policy.”

Trump continued, “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

Soliman reportedly yelled “Free Palestine” in the course of his attack, which left eight people hospitalized — some of them older adults.

Prosecutors charged him Monday with a federal hate crime, one day after the Justice Department denounced the “needless act of violence.” It came around a week after a man shouted support for Palestinians after shooting two Israeli embassy staffers to death outside a Washington, D.C., Jewish museum.

Political leaders, including some who have advocated against Israel’s brutal war in the Gaza Strip, swiftly condemned the Colorado attack as antisemitic.

But GOP leaders have taken the opportunity to demand stricter immigration controls.

“This act of terror could have been prevented, but Biden made a mockery of our national security and America is paying the price for his failures,” House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X.

Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) wrote that Trump had a “mandate” from voters “for mass deportation of illegals like this one,” but was being stymied by Democrats and federal courts siding with due process protections enumerated in the Constitution.

“‘Big Beautiful Bill’ has $14B for mass deportation efforts & $50B to build the wall + secure our border. Can’t pass soon enough!” he said, affirming his support for the Trump tax bill that passed the House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate.

Miller provided a more gruesome take on the incident.

“Suicidal migration must be fully reversed,” Miller wrote on X.

His words seemed to echo his past advocacy for the racist conspiracy theory that non-white immigrants were in the process of “replacing” white Americans and sending the country into decline.

Eight people were injured.

“What happened in Boulder, Colorado—an especially brutal targeting of elders—is an atrocious affront to the very fabric of our society and our beliefs here in Los Angeles,” L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement.

Bass said she would convene an emergency meeting after the conclusion of Shavuot, a Jewish holiday that began at sundown on Sunday and ends Tuesday evening. “Anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in this city,” she said.

Authorities said the attacker, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, targeted demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run for Their Lives, which organizes run and walk events to call for the immediate release of the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.

The group had gathered at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and University of Colorado Boulder students.

Soliman was shouting “Free Palestine,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office.

Four women and four men, ages 52 to 88, were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said. Soliman was arrested and taken to the hospital for treatment, but authorities didn’t elaborate on his injuries.

The FBI is investigating the attack as a targeted act of terrorism.

“This marks the second violent assault on Jewish and pro-Israel civilians in the U.S. in less than two weeks—a chilling escalation that cannot be dismissed as coincidence,” the L.A.-based Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement, referring to the slaying of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington, D.C. on May 21. “Both attacks are the direct result of months of anti-Israel propaganda, moral equivocation, and silence in the face of raging antisemitism.”

Israel’s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others.

Israel’s military response has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90% of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.

PHOTO: REUTERS

WASHINGTON – The 45-year-old man arrested in the attack at a Colorado event in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza has been residing in the US on a visa that expired in 2023, US officials said.

Mohamed Soliman, a citizen of Egypt, was detained after allegedly throwing an incendiary device into a crowd on June 1, injuring eight people. He is believed to have acted alone and isn’t connected on any group or movement, law enforcement officials said.

The incident sparked renewed concern about antisemitic violence in the US less than two weeks after two members of the Israeli Embassy’s staff were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.

The attack may also intensify the White House’s immigration push for more rapid deportations. Mr Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, wrote in an X post that “immigration security is national security.”

“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Mr Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI Denver field office, said at a news conference. “The suspect was heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.”

The people injured in the attack, who ranged in age from 52 to 88, were taken to area hospitals, the Boulder Police Department said in a statement.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the victims “were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days.”

The group Run for Their Lives-Boulder has held regular demonstrations since the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.

Mr Polis said it was “unfathomable” that the Jewish community was facing another attack. The suspect in the killings at the Jewish Museum chanted “Free Free Palestine” while in police custody, law enforcement said.

Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a series of posts on X that the attack “was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas,” adding he trusted the US would prosecute the perpetrator and do all it could to prevent future similar attacks.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said June 1’s Boulder attack “appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” Mr Weiser, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, added that his office stands ready to assist local prosecutors in filing charges. BLOOMBERG

Here's what we know.","Here's what we know about the Boulder, Colorado, attack suspect as he faces hate crime charge

Officials in Boulder, Colorado, have released new information about the attack Sunday on a group of peaceful demonstrators who were marching to support Israeli hostages in Gaza. They now say 15 people were injured, up from eight reported earlier, when the suspect hurled Molotov cocktails at the crowd.

The incident is being investigated as an act of terrorism, according to the FBI, which described it as targeted. The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national, was taken into custody at the scene. He is facing multiple felony charges as well as a federal hate crime charge.

Soliman is being charged in state court with 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, eight ""with intent and deliberation"" and the other eight ""with extreme indifference,"" Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Monday. Officials said additional charges could be forthcoming. He's also being charged with two counts of use of an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

Here is what we know so far:

The attack occurred around 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, near the historic County Courthouse in the city's downtown. It was the site of a march held to advocate for the hostages who were taken from southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, and have yet to be released.

Witnesses said the suspect had a ""makeshift flamethrower"" and yelled ""Free Palestine!"" as he threw Molotov cocktails at demonstrators, leaving multiple people with burns, according to the FBI. Those who suffered injuries had been standing outside the courthouse. In the aftermath, a burn scar was visible in front of the courthouse building.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack, calling it a ""heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.""

The suspect had another 16 unused Molotov cocktails ""within arms reach"" at the time of his arrest, investigators said during a news conference Monday afternoon.

Soliman had set out to kill all the marchers but seemed to have had second thoughts, authorities said. He didn't throw all 18 Molotov cocktails he was carrying ""because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before"" police said in an affidavit cited by The Associated Press.

Authorities said he expressed no regrets about the attack.

One marcher told CBS News Colorado the suspect looked like a landscaper when they approached. But Lisa Trunquist said she felt something odd as they arrived at the courthouse.

""The groundskeeper was here, and I didn't know why. Things were off,"" Trunquist said.

Then, after he tossed the devices, she and her fellow marchers worked as a team to try to put out the flames that were burning their fellow marchers, Trunquist recalled.

The FBI's Colorado office said those who attended the march were participating in a scheduled, weekly event. Organized by the group Run for Their Lives, local branches hold community walks and runs in different cities within Colorado, around the country and internationally.

""We are a local chapter of the global initiative Run For Their Lives,"" reads the description of the Boulder chapter's Facebook page. ""We do an 18 minute weekly walk to show international solidarity with the hostages taken from Israel during the 10/7 massacre, and still being held in Gaza. We will walk until they are all released.""

Rachel Amaru, an organizer at Run for Their Lives in Boulder, called the attack ""blatantly antisemitic"" in comments to CBS News Colorado. It took place less than two weeks after two Israeli Embassy employees were killed in a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., which is also being investigated as a hate crime.

Omer Shachar, a co-leader of Run for Their Lives Denver, told CBS News the group contacted Boulder police several times about security concerns around the event prior to Sunday. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.

Who was injured in the Boulder attack?

Police said the victims of the Boulder attack included eight women and seven men, whose ages range from 25 to 88. One of them was seriously injured, according to Boulder Police Chief Stephan Redfearn, who said the person had been hospitalized in critical condition.

The 88-year-old is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder. Wilhelm described her as a ""very loving person.""

Another victim is a professor at the university, the rabbi said.

Two of the injured were flown by helicopter to the burn unit at UCHealth, and four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, according to police and the hospitals. The injured patients who were taken to Boulder Community Health had either been discharged or transferred elsewhere later Sunday night, the hospital said, although it did not specify how many were discharged versus transferred.

Officials initially said eight people were injured, but raised the number when more people came forward later with less severe injuries.

Who is the Boulder attack suspect?

The suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday.

Witnesses heard Soliman yell ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said it was ""clear this is a targeted act of violence."" Two sources told CBS News that witnesses who spoke to investigators also alleged the suspect shouted ""End Zionist"" during the attack.

The suspect told investigators he ""researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them,"" an affidavit filed by the Department of Justice reads.

He also allegedly ""stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,"" and that he had been planning the attack for a year, the affidavit says.

The suspect had tried to purchase a firearm but couldn't because he was not a U.S. citizen, so he resorted to Molotov cocktails instead, the acting U.S. attorney for Colorado, J. Bishop Grewell, said during a news conference Monday.

Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS News Colorado. Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said he first arrived in the United States in August 2022, originally on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023. She said he filed for asylum a month after arriving in the U.S., in September 2022, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved.

Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder.

He made his first court appearance on Monday and could be seen with a bandage over the right side of his face. He responded ""yes"" when asked whether he understood a judge's question on a protection order against him that keeps him from contacting the victims of his alleged crimes. His next court hearing is Thursday for an official filing of charges.

After the attack on Sunday, authorities evacuated three blocks of Pearl Street for the rest of the day as they probed a vehicle of interest in the area, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. On Sunday night, the FBI said it was ""conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack"" in El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs.

FBI Director Kash Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard have referred to the incident as a terrorist attack.

""The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7,"" Gabbard wrote in a social media post.

Soliman's former employer, an independently owned medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, called Veros Health, told CBS News he had a valid work visa while employed there from May 2023 to August 2023.

""We can confirm that Mohamed Soliman worked with Veros from May 2023 to August 2023. He was hired in our accounting department,"" Roni Mushovic, the CFO at Veros, said in a statement, noting that Soliman underwent the hiring process through ADP, which handles human resources for the clinic.

""At the time of hire, he was confirmed to have a valid work Visa, which was noted to expire on March 2025,"" Mushovic said.

Prior to Sunday's attack, Soliman was driving for Uber, which required him to have a valid Social Security number, CBS News has learned. According to an Uber spokesperson, he passed a background check and provided a photo ID and Social Security number when the company hired him in the spring of 2023, and passed another background check ""about nine months ago.""

WASHINGTON – The 45-year-old man arrested in the attack at a Colorado event in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza has been residing in the US on a visa that expired in 2023, US officials said.

Mohamed Soliman, a citizen of Egypt, was detained after allegedly throwing an incendiary device into a crowd on June 1, injuring eight people. He is believed to have acted alone and isn’t connected on any group or movement, law enforcement officials said.

The incident sparked renewed concern about antisemitic violence in the US less than two weeks after two members of the Israeli Embassy’s staff were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.

The attack may also intensify the White House’s immigration push for more rapid deportations. Mr Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, wrote in an X post that “immigration security is national security.”

“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd,” Mr Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI Denver field office, said at a news conference. “The suspect was heard to yell ‘Free Palestine’ during the attack.”

The people injured in the attack, who ranged in age from 52 to 88, were taken to area hospitals, the Boulder Police Department said in a statement.

Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the victims “were brutally attacked while peacefully marching to draw attention to the plight of the hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days.”

The group Run for Their Lives-Boulder has held regular demonstrations since the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.

Mr Polis said it was “unfathomable” that the Jewish community was facing another attack. The suspect in the killings at the Jewish Museum chanted “Free Free Palestine” while in police custody, law enforcement said.

Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a series of posts on X that the attack “was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas,” adding he trusted the US would prosecute the perpetrator and do all it could to prevent future similar attacks.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said June 1’s Boulder attack “appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” Mr Weiser, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, added that his office stands ready to assist local prosecutors in filing charges. BLOOMBERG

The US president has pinned the blame on Joe Biden's ""ridiculous border policy"" after the attack on a pro-Israel rally in Boulder, Colorado - as a man is charged with federal hate crime.

Writing on his platform Truth Social, Trump slammed Joe Biden for his ""ridiculous Open Border Policy"".

He said: ""Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America.""

He slammed Biden's 'policy', stating it ""hurt our country so badly. He must go under ""TRUMP"" Policy.

""Acts of terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders secure, and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our homeland.""

The US president added that his ""heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the great people of Boulder, Colorado!""

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with a federal hate crime in connection with the Colorado attack.

A criminal complaint filed against the suspect said there is probable cause to believe he attacked the demonstrators on Sunday with a makeshift flamethrower because they were supporting Israel in calling for the release of hostages being held by Hamas.

He is charged in the US District Court in Colorado with a hate crime pertaining to actual or perceived race, religion or national origin.

The man reportedly shouted ""Free Palestine"" in Boulder, Colorado, as he launched the attack at the rally, police said.

Eyewitnesses said the suspect lobbed Molotov cocktails, a homemade bomb constructed out of a bottle filled with petrol and stuffed with a piece of cloth to use as a fuse, into people attending the protest.

It comes as eight people aged between 52 and 88 - including a Holocaust survivor - were injured in the attack.

The 88-year-old was injured along with her daughter, according to a community leader.

Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said the mother had been ""through enough trauma"".

Funk told CNN she had spoken to several victims of the attack - including one who had suffered ""horrible burns"".

No deaths have been reported.

Ms Funk said: “This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war.

“These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

He is also charged with one count of attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, and one count of causing serious injury to an at-risk adult or someone over 70 and one count of using explosives or incendiary devices.

The FBI described the incident, which took place at Boulder Country Historic Courthouse, as a “targeted terror attack”.

Footage on social media shows a shirtless man holding bottles with cloth and clear liquid inside. Videos also show the man being detained at the scene.

Soliman is understood to be an Egyptian national who seemingly acted alone. Authorities said he has no previous significant contact with law enforcement.

Dan Bongino, a deputy director at the FBI, said: ""We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence.

Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called the incident ""pure anti-semitism"" on social media, adding that the attack is ""terrorism"" and demanding ""concrete action"".

He said: ""Jewish protesters were brutally attacked. Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border - it is already burning the streets of America.""

“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,"" Colorado's Attorney General Phil Weiser said.

The group of people attacked were said to be peacefully demonstrating to show solidarity for Israeli hostages in Gaza, organised by a group called 'Run for Their Lives'.

Weiser continued: “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences.""

The suspect in the Boulder firebomb attack had reportedly worked at the Veros Health medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado.

He had also spent six months working at the independent physicians practice from early 2024 - sources told CBS News.

It's unclear what his role was at the clinic.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Soliman entered the US in August 2022 on a B-2 tourist visa and was given a 12-month work authorisation in March 2023.

Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, told police he had planned it for a year and targeted what he described as the “Zionist group”, the FBI said.

Eight people were injured in the attack in Colorado, some with burns, as a group was concluding a weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Witnesses reported the man shouted “Free Palestine” during the attack.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody on Sunday and told the police he would do it again. The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charged filed by the Justice Department on Monday.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street shopping centre, a four-block area in central Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the US.

The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah, and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy employees outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement on Monday saying he, his wife and the nation of Israel were praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the “vicious terror attack” in Colorado.

“Sadly, attacks like this are becoming too common across the country,” said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office.

In New York, the police department said it had upped its presence at religious sites throughout the city for Shavuot.

The eight victims who were wounded were aged between 52 and 88 and the injuries ranged from serious to minor, officials said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding a weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Alex Osante, of San Diego, said he was having lunch when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a “boom” sound followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Mr Osante, people can be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Mr Osante said had caught fire during the attack.

After the initial attack, Mr Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a petrol bomb, but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it.

The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video filmed by Mr Osante.

Law enforcement found more than a dozen unlit petrol bombs near where Soliman was arrested. Inside his car, officers found papers with the words “Israel”, “Palestine,” and “USAid”, the affidavit says.

Soliman told investigators he constructed homemade petrol bombs after doing research online and buying the ingredients. He drove to Boulder with the devices in his car and stopped on the way for fuel, according to the affidavit.

He said in his interview that his goal was to “kill all Zionists”, the FBI said, and that he targeted the group and knew they they would be assembled on Sunday afternoon.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Police investigate the scene of an 'act of terror' in and talk with witnesses on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado.

Authorities said on Sunday they believed Soliman acted alone and that no other suspect was being sought.

He was also injured and was taken to hospital to be treated. Authorities did not give details of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

Soliman was living in the US illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

She added that Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorisation in March 2023 that had expired.

Public records listed him as living in a modest rented townhouse in Colorado Springs, where local media outlets reported federal law enforcement agents were on the scene on Sunday.

An online resume under Soliman’s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with previous employers listed as companies in Egypt.

Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic centre for Islamic and Arabic learning in Cairo.

FBI leaders immediately declared the attack an act of terrorism and the Justice Department denounced it as a “needless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans”.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said.",An FBI affidavit says Mohammed Sabry Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody on Sunday.

(KKTV) - A man living in El Paso County is facing a multitude of charges following what the FBI is describing as a terror attack on a group of peaceful marchers in Boulder over the weekend.

Mohamed Soliman, 45, remains in the Boulder County jail Tuesday on a $10 million bond and will be making his first court appearance at 1:30 p.m., according to online jail records.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration and Boulder Police Department held a press conference Monday afternoon where officials said the number of victims has increased from eight to 12, but they believe the number of victims could increase more as the investigation continues.

Officials said Soliman is now facing 16 charges of attempted murder, two counts of use of an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. They said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were also found in Soliman’s possession.

Officials said Soliman allegedly previously attempted to purchase a firearm but could not because he was not a legal U.S. citizen.

As of 3 p.m., officials also shared that up to three of those victims were still in the hospital.

An FBI affidavit obtained by 11 News states Soliman told agents he planned the attack for a year, specifically targeting “Zionist groups” and showed no remorse, claiming he would do it again. 11 News is going through the affidavit now and will update this article with additional information from the document.

The horrific attack was reported around 1:30 Sunday afternoon near the popular Pearl Street Mall. According to witnesses and later confirmed by law enforcement, demonstrators walking in solidarity with Israeli hostages were making their way down Pearl Street and approaching the Boulder County courthouse when a man attacked them with a flamethrower and a Molotov cocktail. Boulder police said the initial 911 calls were reporting someone setting people on fire.

“We stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn’t even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I’m just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,” one of the marchers, Ed Victor, told 11 News sister station CBS Denver.

“I saw the aftermath,” a witness told CBS Denver. “It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.”

Boulder police say the suspect was heard yelling “Free Palestine” before the attack. He was arrested near the scene minutes after the attack.

While court records show Soliman is facing murder charges, the Boulder Police Department clarified Monday morning that none of the victims had died. Police and the FBI had said previously that eight people were hurt, four men and four women, ranging in age from 52 to 88, though, as of Monday, that number of victims has increased to 12. While some of the injuries were described as minor, at least two of the victims were reportedly airlifted to hospitals with burn units.

Boulder Police Department confirmed Soliman was a resident of El Paso County. The FBI searched an apartment in Cimarron Hills Sunday night, which neighbors have told 11 News is where the suspect lived in the home with his family. One neighbor said that while her children played with Soliman’s children and the family had brought them meals on occasion, Soliman himself wasn’t home often.

FBI Director Kash Patel called this a “terror attack,” saying FBI agents were on scene alongside local law enforcement. The FBI later confirmed they were investigating the attack as a targeted act of terrorism.

Boulder police initially said they were still working to figure out the motive of the attacker.

“We understand that there are a lot of tensions right now and a lot of issues in the United States and everywhere,” Boulder police said. “Once we have a clear motive, we will react accordingly, and if that motive was a group was targeted, we’ll absolutely step up and ensure that additional security, additional presence. We want people to feel safe not matter what they’re here for.”

Gov. Jared Polis posted about it on social media, as well, responding to the attack.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called the attack a hate crime, releasing the following statement:

Colorado Springs Mayor Yemi Mobolade also released a statement following the attack:

As officials investigate motive, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller said the suspect in this case was in the country illegally. CBS Denver reports Soliman was an Egyptian national who arrived in California in 2022 and had overstayed his visa.

The incident occurred on Sunday (June 1) at a pro-Israeli rally in Boulder, Colorado, leaving eight people injured, some with burns.

Four women and four men, aged between 52 and 88, were hospitalised following the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a busy pedestrian area in Colorado.

The FBI stated that Soliman admitted planning the attack for a year, targeting what he described as a “Zionist group.” After being taken into custody, he reportedly confessed and said he would do it again. The Justice Department filed federal hate crime charges against him on Monday.

Todd Lyons, acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), revealed that Soliman had overstayed a visa and had an expired work permit. He criticised previous immigration screening procedures: “There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren’t properly screened that were allowed in. I will tell you that’s a huge effort for ICE right now.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson added that Soliman entered the US in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month, but remains in the country illegally.

President Donald Trump condemned the attack in a social media post, stating: “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

“Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border — it is already burning the streets of America,” said Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon.

“This is an attack on all of us — and we will not stay silent,” said the Israeli-American Council in a statement.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote on X: “A terror attack was committed in Boulder, Colorado by an illegal alien. He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit. Suicidal migration must be fully reversed.”

The attack marks a continued rise in violence against Jewish Americans linked to the conflict in Gaza. It comes weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy aides near Washington’s Capital Jewish Museum, also reportedly motivated by political grievances.

The FBI has raided Soliman’s home in El Paso County, Colorado, but provided no further details, citing the ongoing investigation. Boulder Police said they plan to hold a press conference Monday to share more information.

The violent incident took place as part of a weekly demonstration organized by Run for Their Lives, a group advocating for hostages held in Gaza. It also coincided with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, a period marked by Torah readings and reflection.

The attack has intensified concerns about a recent surge in antisemitic violence in the US, fueled by escalating tensions from the Israel-Hamas war.

Trump strongly condemning the attack on a pro-Israel rally, in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, wrote, “Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America.” He highlighted what he called the “ridiculous Open Border Policy” of President Joe Biden, blaming it for the suspect’s presence in the country.

“He must go out under ‘TRUMP’ policy” Calling for stronger immigration enforcement, Trump said, “He must go out under ‘TRUMP’ Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.”

He emphasised the importance of secure borders, stating, “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

(KKTV) - Colorado officials are expressing sorrow and horror after a man allegedly attacked a group of peaceful demonstrators in Boulder with a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails, injuring 12.

The attack unfolded early Sunday afternoon outside the Boulder County courthouse and just up the street from the Pearl Street Mall. The victims, which reportedly included an 88-year-old Holocaust victim, were all taking in part in a walk of solidarity with the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza.

Click here and here for 11 News’ coverage on the attack and ensuing search at an El Paso County residence where the suspect is said to live.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, called the attack heinous, targeted and antisemitic:

“My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community. Boulder is strong. We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community. I’ve spoken with Boulder Mayor Brockett, and my administration is working closely with local and federal law enforcement on this afternoon’s attack. I thank the first responders who ran to help the injured and ensure victims received medical attention needed and to apprehend the suspect. As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot. Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

The Islamic Center of Boulder condemned the attack and called for a focus on the victims:

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn, whose department along with the FBI is investigating the crime, released a statement on the police department’s social media pages Sunday night:

“Boulder is not immune to tragedy sadly and I know a lot of people are scared right now and questioning how this happened and why. Boulder has recovered from acts of violence before and we will again recover. I urge this community to come together. Now is not the time to be divisive. When this call came out today, our officers rushed to the scene as quickly as they could to protect our community and arrest the suspect and I’m very proud of their response. I also greatly appreciate all of our law enforcement and community partners who responded to help as well. I want to assure our Boulder community that we will have increased presence at many events and locations throughout the city to ensure safety.”

El Paso County Sheriff Joseph Roybal released a statement Monday morning, hours after it was learned that the suspect resided near Colorado Springs.

“My office mourns alongside the victims and their families following the tragic and senseless act of violence which occurred yesterday in Boulder. Acts of terrorism and hate have no place in Colorado or anywhere in our country. The El Paso County Sheriff’s Office remains fully committed to standing with our local and federal law enforcement partners to protect the safety and well-being of our communities. I am deeply grateful to my deputies who responded swiftly to support the Boulder Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, helping to secure a residence connected to the investigation. I also want to express my sincere appreciation for all first responders whose immediate actions provided critical aid to the victims at the scene. This horrible incident underscores the importance of working with and collaborating with our federal law enforcement partners.”

U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, who represents Colorado, released a series of statements on social media:

Rep. Joe Neguse, who serves Colorado’s 2nd District (which Boulder is a part of):

“Horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon, and my wife Andrea and I are praying hard for the victims. Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of antisemitism. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence. We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families in the weeks ahead, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”

Rep. Jeff Crank, who serves Colorado’s 5th District (encompassing most of El Paso County):

“I’m horrified by the inexcusable act of terror targeting people who were peacefully demonstrating for the release of the remaining hostages in Israel. This is tragic and terrifying for all of us, but especially the Jewish community. We must condemn these violent attacks unequivocally and also stand against the antisemitic rhetoric that paves its way. I’m deeply sorry to the people who have been injured and to the Jewish community who has been targeted again. My heart goes out to the victims and families. This perpetrator will be brought to justice.”

The Orange Man Baby has been mocked for having what looks like an AI-generated image of himself on his phone - with social media users branding him a 'narcissist'

Most people have a photo of their family or loved ones on their phone's lock screen - but not Donald Trump.

The Orange Man Baby was rumbled during a press conference over the weekend when his phone was spotted, apparently with a photo of himself on it pointing at the camera. Political commentator Harry Sisson shared his thoughts on TikTok, saying: ""Donald Trump was holding a press conference and his phone screen was seen.

""Can you take a guess as to what the lockscreen photo is? If you guess himself, you'd be absolutely right."" Even more bizarre, the image appears to be AI-generated one from his last election campaign.

Harry asked viewers in his clip: ""Do you know how narcissistic you have to be to want yourself to be the home screen? You'd be constantly looking at yourself.

""Normal people might have a photo of themselves and others - family or friends - but no, in Donald Trump's world, it's a constant him."" The 78-year-old has since been mocked for the outing.

The post has had 77.5k likes and more than 2.5k comments from bemused users. One person wrote: ""Did he Google that and download it? Probably not, but it's a funny thought.""

Another added: ""It's like people who have portraits of themselves hanging at home. It's so odd,"" while others dubbed him a ""narcissist"".

However, not everyone was against Trump having a photo of himself on his phone. ""I hate to be that guy, but people be having photos of themselves on their Lock Screens all the time. It’s not that big a deal,"" wrote one.

Someone else agreed, saying: ""I don’t see anything wrong with having a wallpaper of yourself."" Another joked: ""It's not Putin?""

This isn't the first time Trump has fixated over his image, however. The Orange Man Baby recently threw a wobbler over an ""unflattering"" portrait of him on display in Colorado's State Capitol - and demanded its removal.

He posted a tirade on his Truth Social platform earlier this year in March. It read: ""Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves.

""But the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor... was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.""

Trump did express admiration for artist Sarah Boardman's portrait of Barack Obama, but cheekily suggested she had ""lost"" her talent with age. ""He looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst.""

""She must have lost her talent as she got older. In any event, I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one,"" he vented.

Officials said eight victims were injured, four women and four men, between 52 and 88 years old.

The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was booked into jail on several charges on Sunday.

Witnesses reported the suspect also threw an incendiary device into the crowd and was heard yelling “Free Palestine.”

⬇️ Jump to: Live blog with updates below.

On Sunday night, Boulder County Jail booking records showed Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was booked on the following charges:
• Crimes against at risk adult/elderly > 70 – serious injury
• Murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent – non family – gun
• Murder in the first degree extreme indifference
• Explosives or incendiary devices use during felony – incendiary
• First degree assault – heat of passion – non family – weapon

The injuries sustained in the attack, Chief of Boulder Police Stephen Redfearn said, range from minor to severe. One witness told FOX31 that, “Every, every one of the victims I could tell that I saw had skin basically melted or hanging from their, from their legs.” Another victim said he saw a woman on fire.

Sunday’s attack occurred during a peaceful, weekly demonstration held by Run for Their Lives in Boulder. The group described itself as an apolitical organization that has the sole mission of “walking peacefully to raise awareness for the 58 hostages still held in captivity by Hamas in Gaza.”

The group reaffirmed its commitment to peacefully calling for the swift return of all the hostages.

Redfearn said that he was aware of national law enforcement calling the incident a “terror attack,” but said he would not speculate on motive during this early stage of the investigation.

The Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said it was supporting the county and prepared to provide resources as requested.

13th Street, which crosses the Pearl Street Mall, is a car-accessible road that crosses the walkable portion of the shopping area. The roadway borders the Boulder County Historic Courthouse and a few other county offices.

An official with the Department of Homeland Security said Soliman is in the U.S. illegally. He allegedly entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa, which expired in February 2023. DHS also said he filed for asylum in September 2022.

FOX News is reporting that DHS sources said Soliman was an Egyptian national.

Gov. Jared Polis released this statement following an attack on demonstrators in Boulder calling for the release of hostages in Gaza.

“My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured by this heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community. Boulder is strong. We have overcome tragedies together and will get through this together as a community. I’ve spoken with Boulder Mayor Brockett, and my administration is working closely with local and federal law enforcement on this afternoon’s attack. I thank the first responders who ran to help the injured and ensure victims received medical attention needed and to apprehend the suspect. As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot. Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

FBI Acting Agent in Charge Mark Michalek said the incident is being investigated as an act of terror.

One man spoke to FOX31’s Jeremy Hubbard about the incident and said he was afraid of repercussions to his family.

“You see all these hate crimes that are going on around the country, things that are happening to Jews all around the country, and I’ve got two kids and despite my my initial instinct to run into this situation it’s once I was there, I realized how dangerous it was, which is one of the reasons why I didn’t go and and tackle this guy,” Brian told Hubbard. “But like I didn’t want to do anything that would affect my family.”

The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was charged in the attack that injured eight people, some with burns, as a group was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Witnesses reported the man yelled ""Free Palestine"" during the attack.

An FBI affidavit, released in support of the federal hate crime charge filed by the Justice Department on Monday, says Mohammed Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again.

In response to the attack, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday that the attack ""WILL NOT BE TOLERATED"" in the U.S.

Trump said that the suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who is currently in the country after overstaying a tourist visa, came into the U.S. through former U.S. President Joe Biden's ""ridiculous Open Border Policy,"" which he said has hurt the U.S. ""badly.""

""He must go out under 'TRUMP' Policy,"" he wrote, adding that acts of terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. ""This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders secure and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our homeland,"" he continued.

While offering condolences to the victims and ""the great people of Boulder, Colorado,"" Trump did not mention Israel, the hostages, or any possible expressions of antisemitism related to the attack.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law.""

""The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,"" he said.

President Isaac Herzog also issued his condolences to the victims while speaking to U.S. Jewish community leaders, saying, ""This vile act of terror is a painful reminder that antisemitism knows no borders,"" adding that it serves as a reminder that the ""American and Israeli people stand united to bring the hostages homeland ensure no Jew, anywhere, stands alone.""",

Two of the new cases were unvaccinated adults living in El Paso County who passed through the airport at about the same time on May 14. The third was a vaccinated Arapahoe County resident who was a passenger on Turkish Airlines flight 201, which landed at DIA on May 13 and carried a contagious passenger.

Two doses of the vaccine are about 97% effective, meaning a small number of people develop breakthrough cases.

All three patients are recovering at home, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declare an outbreak if a state has at least three linked cases. The Turkish Airlines flight meets the definition of an outbreak, but the state health department hasn’t seen any evidence of spread throughout the community, spokeswoman Hope Shuler said.

The Arapahoe County resident didn’t go out during their contagious period, so they couldn’t pass on the virus. The El Paso County residents visited three locations between them, and public health officials advised people to watch for symptoms if they went to the following places:
• Love’s Travel Stop and Carl’s Jr., 748 22 Road, Grand Junction, from 6 to 10 p.m. May 27. Symptoms could develop through June 17.
• Maverick Gas Station, 2588 Airport Road, Colorado Springs, from 9 to 11:30 a.m. May 28. Symptoms could develop through June 18.
• King Soopers, 1750 W. Uintah St., Colorado Springs, from 8:30 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. May 31. Symptoms could develop through June 21.

Unvaccinated people can sometimes prevent infection by getting the measles shot within 72 hours of exposure. That window has passed for people exposed at the truck stop and gas station, but those exposed at King Soopers still have the option.

Initial symptoms of measles include a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. The red rash typically develops about four days after a person becomes contagious. People who think they could have measles should call ahead before visiting a health care provider, so they can take precautions to avoid infecting other patients.

Other cases among Colorado residents include another Arapahoe County adult and an Arapahoe County child younger than 5, both of whom arrived on the Turkish Airlines flight; an adult from Pueblo; a Denver baby and an unidentified person who lives in the same house; a Denver adult; and an Archuleta County adult.

The child needed care at Children’s Hospital Colorado, which hasn’t released information about their condition. The adult patients all recovered at home.

In a typical year, Colorado has two or fewer measles cases. The last time the state recorded more than 10 in a year was in the 1990s.

It wasn't ideological bias, he wants you to believe. Oh, sure, there are people within the Manhattan-Beltway media complex who are Democrats, to be certain, but that had nothing to do with why they failed to press the issue of Former President Joe Biden not being fit for office on the 2020 campaign trail when the signs were clearly there. And that doesn't even take into account the dozens upon dozens of examples of Biden slipping his cognitive transmission between 2nd and 3rd gears during his four-year regency.



No, Thompson argues, it wasn't ideological bias. It was concern that we in media would lose our sources. The party in power would be mad at us, and other media outlets would be mad at us, and we'd be shunned. 





Chuck Todd, formerly of NBC News and its Sunday news program, Meet the Press, continued his attempt at pulling a Jedi mind trick so ambitious as to make the Late Sir Alec Guinness blush. This was with Piers Morgan late last week. 





Jake Tapper, Thompson's Original Sin co-author and CNN anchor would have you believe he hates both parties and didn't vote for either one of them. 





You don't have to vote, or in Tapper's stated case, stand either party to have ideological leanings impact your reporting. Lord knows there are plenty of Never Trumpers who claim the entire conservative movement has lost their collective minds and fallen prey to Donald Trump's cult of personality. They can't stand the current Republican Party, but at least several Never Trumpers still hold to what can generally be agreed to as conservative principles. 



Jake Tapper can be mad as he wants at the current roster of Democrats leading the party, but it simply defies credulity to believe anything other than he leans to the left, and puts his thumb on the scale when deciding whether or how hard to push on a story lead. 



Just for the sake of argument, let's give Tapper, Thompson, and Todd their premise. They're not biased. It's just those gosh darned lying liar Democrats, all of them, lied their lying pants off to us. If that's so, then what is their excuse for how the Beltway Bubble covers stories now, especially if they don't necessarily have anything to do with who was running the country in a politburo? 



I have a handful of examples from over the weekend to help ascertain whether this newfound promise of Beltway journos to not be suckered by the lies any longer, to get back to dogged reporting and chasing the truth wherever it may be lurking, is happening or not.



We'll start with the very serious, and move to the relatively silly, and then back to very serious. All are illustrative to my proposition that media is still gaslighting you and has not changed a bit about what they cover and how they cover it. 



The Trump administration, along with the Israeli government, organized a new way of providing food and other relief into the Gaza Strip, hopefully bypassing Hamas entirely and getting aid directly to the Palestinians who need it. Hamas, which still operates all of the propaganda coming out of the Strip, came up with another blood libel on Israel, that 20-plus people will killed in cold blood by IDF soldiers at one of these new aid stations. This is the headline from the New York Times. 





The Times was not the only outlet to repeat the Hamas Health Ministry talking points verbatim. So did CNN and the BBC.





The Washington Post was no better. 





There are two ideological viewpoints - varying gradations of progressivism on the left, and the same for conservatism on the right. Are there currently voices on the right that are anti-Israel and/or antisemitic? Sure. They are very few, and they are pariahs, especially on this issue, within the Republican Party apparatus, as they should be. Can the same be said for the Democratic Party? No. Whether it's members of the Squad in the House Democratic Caucus, or in academia, the Jew hatred that's been increasing at a disturbing level the last five years has been entirely on the left. In this case, the Times, CNN, and BBC are reflecting that virulent leftist worldview without pushing back or voicing objectivity. They didn't question the information they are getting from Hamas. What they wrote is no different than what Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or Rashida Tlaib would say in a press conference. So if there's no media bias, why the thumb on the scale against Israel every single time?

Of course, being that Hamas was behind the accusation in the first place, you know what was coming next, right? Outing the accusation as the lie it was from the onset. From Former Ambassador to Israel David Friedman:

The IDF even released security footage for the time the alleged massacre took place. 





It simply did not happen. Media were lied to again by Hamas, after being lied to hundreds of times since the October 7th attack, an attack that actually was a massacre, and yet media still falls for the lie. If it is not due to an ideological kinship with the anti-Israel wing of the Democratic Party, what else explains the same mistakes in editorial judgment and coverage over and over again? 



Even CNN, Jake Tapper's network, had to retract their original reportage. 







What do you want to bet Tapper's apology tour the last couple weeks, including promises he'll do better, won't extend to covering this story for what it was, intentional misinformation and libel, and get to the bottom of how his network, along with so many others, got willingly duped once again?



On the night of Inauguration Day, at the last rally of the evening held inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., Elon Musk came out to a thunderous ovation and patted his heart and extended his arm to the crowd. Instantly, it was branded a Nazi salute, and Beltway media was all over it. 



 



Saturday night in Anaheim, California, as part of a California Democratic Party conference, New Jersey Senator Cory 'Spartacus' Booker was the keynote speaker, and felt the love of his fellow Volksgenosse.

Has the Beltway media, being they're not biased and all, done the same seizing and pouncing to Booker that they did with Musk? Why, no. In fact, in one of the few places that even mentioned the Herr Booker controversy, Newsweek, this was their headline.

Not whether or not he did the Seig Heil (which according to the rule media set in late January, he clearly did), but the story is that MAGA is accusing Booker, meaning Booker is looked upon as the victim. 



How did Tapper fare during the blitzkrieg of media coverage over Elon Musk's gesture? 





To be fair, he wasn't tapped to host CNN's Sunday show, State of the Union. It was Dana Bash's turn. As a baseline, how did she handle the Musk gesture in January? 



She brought on Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. 





Yesterday, Bash was in the host chair again, and had every opportunity to give Booker the same treatment she gave Musk. She brought on the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries. Did she bring up the subject at all? Ask for a response? Nope. 



Two segments later, Bash brought in the aforementioned Senator Murphy, who is being eyed as a potential primary challenger of Booker in 2028 for the presidential nomination. Murphy had no problem getting in front of his skis with Musk. Did Bash give the opportunity to Murphy to hammer Booker? Nope. The only topics that came up were disagreements they had with the Trump administration on the budget bill and foreign policy. She was teeing up softballs. 



Finally, back to the very serious. Sunday saw another vicious terrorist attack aimed specifically at Jews and those who support the state of Israel. This time, it was Molotov cocktails thrown at a pro-Israel walk/rally in Boulder, CO. 





We won't know the full extent of casualties for a while, but there were several that suffered burns. The terrorist has been arrested and identified. He's about what you would expect. 





Dan Bongino and Kash Patel at FBI have indicated this is being investigated as a targeted terror attack, which it obviously is. Boulder Police are hesitant to go that far, being that they're, well, Boulder. 



How did the New York Times write this one up? 





By the way, as of Sunday afternoon, you had to do a search on their website to even find this story. The propaganda piece by the Hamas Health Ministry blood libeling the IDF of killing 20 people at the aid facility? That's still up, front page, un-retracted. 



By the time you read this column, we will know the pith of this terrorist in Colorado's gist. It seems pretty apparent from his screed caught on cellphones that he's not a fan of Jews, Israel, or for that matter, the United States. He threw a Molotov cocktail at a crowd that included families, parents and kids, because he figured it was only fair to burn kids alive here after what he perceives is happening in Gaza. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this terrorist did not wear a red MAGA hat at a Trump rally anytime recently. 



How much airtime do you think MSNBC and CNN will give this story today? Do you think Tapper will devote any time to this, or to the toxic, inflammatory rhetoric by the antisemitic wing of the Democratic Party in the same way media treats Republicans whenever there's the slightest chance someone on the far right fringe snaps? 



The reason we can presume that media will, as David Burge, @IowaHawkBlog on X famously says, smother this story with a pillow until it quits moving is because Fox News' Bill Melugin, an actual reporter, has already got the 411 on the subhuman who threw a couple firebombs into a crowd. 





Illegal immigrant on a visa overstay bringing global jihad to Boulder, you say? That's the end of that story if you're employed at CNN or MSNBC. Cannot wait for Colorado Senator Michael Bennet's CODEL to Egypt to try to spring his constituent free from prison in a few weeks. 



Don't tell me there is no media bias. There is good reporting in Original Sin, but it is far from complete reporting. It's C-Y-A reportage, and ignores the aiding, abetting, and culpability of the media.

It wasn't ideological bias, he wants you to believe. Oh, sure, there are people within the Manhattan-Beltway media complex who are Democrats, to be certain, but that had nothing to do with why they failed to press the issue of Former President Joe Biden not being fit for office on the 2020 campaign trail when the signs were clearly there. And that doesn't even take into account the dozens upon dozens of examples of Biden slipping his cognitive transmission between 2nd and 3rd gears during his four-year regency.



No, Thompson argues, it wasn't ideological bias. It was concern that we in media would lose our sources. The party in power would be mad at us, and other media outlets would be mad at us, and we'd be shunned. 





Chuck Todd, formerly of NBC News and its Sunday news program, Meet the Press, continued his attempt at pulling a Jedi mind trick so ambitious as to make the Late Sir Alec Guinness blush. This was with Piers Morgan late last week. 





Jake Tapper, Thompson's Original Sin co-author and CNN anchor would have you believe he hates both parties and didn't vote for either one of them. 





You don't have to vote, or in Tapper's stated case, stand either party to have ideological leanings impact your reporting. Lord knows there are plenty of Never Trumpers who claim the entire conservative movement has lost their collective minds and fallen prey to Donald Trump's cult of personality. They can't stand the current Republican Party, but at least several Never Trumpers still hold to what can generally be agreed to as conservative principles. 



Jake Tapper can be mad as he wants at the current roster of Democrats leading the party, but it simply defies credulity to believe anything other than he leans to the left, and puts his thumb on the scale when deciding whether or how hard to push on a story lead. 



Just for the sake of argument, let's give Tapper, Thompson, and Todd their premise. They're not biased. It's just those gosh darned lying liar Democrats, all of them, lied their lying pants off to us. If that's so, then what is their excuse for how the Beltway Bubble covers stories now, especially if they don't necessarily have anything to do with who was running the country in a politburo? 



I have a handful of examples from over the weekend to help ascertain whether this newfound promise of Beltway journos to not be suckered by the lies any longer, to get back to dogged reporting and chasing the truth wherever it may be lurking, is happening or not.



We'll start with the very serious, and move to the relatively silly, and then back to very serious. All are illustrative to my proposition that media is still gaslighting you and has not changed a bit about what they cover and how they cover it. 



The Trump administration, along with the Israeli government, organized a new way of providing food and other relief into the Gaza Strip, hopefully bypassing Hamas entirely and getting aid directly to the Palestinians who need it. Hamas, which still operates all of the propaganda coming out of the Strip, came up with another blood libel on Israel, that 20-plus people will killed in cold blood by IDF soldiers at one of these new aid stations. This is the headline from the New York Times. 





The Times was not the only outlet to repeat the Hamas Health Ministry talking points verbatim. So did CNN and the BBC.





The Washington Post was no better. 





There are two ideological viewpoints - varying gradations of progressivism on the left, and the same for conservatism on the right. Are there currently voices on the right that are anti-Israel and/or antisemitic? Sure. They are very few, and they are pariahs, especially on this issue, within the Republican Party apparatus, as they should be. Can the same be said for the Democratic Party? No. Whether it's members of the Squad in the House Democratic Caucus, or in academia, the Jew hatred that's been increasing at a disturbing level the last five years has been entirely on the left. In this case, the Times, CNN, and BBC are reflecting that virulent leftist worldview without pushing back or voicing objectivity. They didn't question the information they are getting from Hamas. What they wrote is no different than what Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or Rashida Tlaib would say in a press conference. So if there's no media bias, why the thumb on the scale against Israel every single time?

Of course, being that Hamas was behind the accusation in the first place, you know what was coming next, right? Outing the accusation as the lie it was from the onset. From Former Ambassador to Israel David Friedman:

The IDF even released security footage for the time the alleged massacre took place. 





It simply did not happen. Media were lied to again by Hamas, after being lied to hundreds of times since the October 7th attack, an attack that actually was a massacre, and yet media still falls for the lie. If it is not due to an ideological kinship with the anti-Israel wing of the Democratic Party, what else explains the same mistakes in editorial judgment and coverage over and over again? 



Even CNN, Jake Tapper's network, had to retract their original reportage. 







What do you want to bet Tapper's apology tour the last couple weeks, including promises he'll do better, won't extend to covering this story for what it was, intentional misinformation and libel, and get to the bottom of how his network, along with so many others, got willingly duped once again?



On the night of Inauguration Day, at the last rally of the evening held inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., Elon Musk came out to a thunderous ovation and patted his heart and extended his arm to the crowd. Instantly, it was branded a Nazi salute, and Beltway media was all over it. 



 



Saturday night in Anaheim, California, as part of a California Democratic Party conference, New Jersey Senator Cory 'Spartacus' Booker was the keynote speaker, and felt the love of his fellow Volksgenosse.

Has the Beltway media, being they're not biased and all, done the same seizing and pouncing to Booker that they did with Musk? Why, no. In fact, in one of the few places that even mentioned the Herr Booker controversy, Newsweek, this was their headline.

Not whether or not he did the Seig Heil (which according to the rule media set in late January, he clearly did), but the story is that MAGA is accusing Booker, meaning Booker is looked upon as the victim. 



How did Tapper fare during the blitzkrieg of media coverage over Elon Musk's gesture? 





To be fair, he wasn't tapped to host CNN's Sunday show, State of the Union. It was Dana Bash's turn. As a baseline, how did she handle the Musk gesture in January? 



She brought on Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. 





Yesterday, Bash was in the host chair again, and had every opportunity to give Booker the same treatment she gave Musk. She brought on the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries. Did she bring up the subject at all? Ask for a response? Nope. 



Two segments later, Bash brought in the aforementioned Senator Murphy, who is being eyed as a potential primary challenger of Booker in 2028 for the presidential nomination. Murphy had no problem getting in front of his skis with Musk. Did Bash give the opportunity to Murphy to hammer Booker? Nope. The only topics that came up were disagreements they had with the Trump administration on the budget bill and foreign policy. She was teeing up softballs. 



Finally, back to the very serious. Sunday saw another vicious terrorist attack aimed specifically at Jews and those who support the state of Israel. This time, it was Molotov cocktails thrown at a pro-Israel walk/rally in Boulder, CO. 





We won't know the full extent of casualties for a while, but there were several that suffered burns. The terrorist has been arrested and identified. He's about what you would expect. 





Dan Bongino and Kash Patel at FBI have indicated this is being investigated as a targeted terror attack, which it obviously is. Boulder Police are hesitant to go that far, being that they're, well, Boulder. 



How did the New York Times write this one up? 





By the way, as of Sunday afternoon, you had to do a search on their website to even find this story. The propaganda piece by the Hamas Health Ministry blood libeling the IDF of killing 20 people at the aid facility? That's still up, front page, un-retracted. 



By the time you read this column, we will know the pith of this terrorist in Colorado's gist. It seems pretty apparent from his screed caught on cellphones that he's not a fan of Jews, Israel, or for that matter, the United States. He threw a Molotov cocktail at a crowd that included families, parents and kids, because he figured it was only fair to burn kids alive here after what he perceives is happening in Gaza. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this terrorist did not wear a red MAGA hat at a Trump rally anytime recently. 



How much airtime do you think MSNBC and CNN will give this story today? Do you think Tapper will devote any time to this, or to the toxic, inflammatory rhetoric by the antisemitic wing of the Democratic Party in the same way media treats Republicans whenever there's the slightest chance someone on the far right fringe snaps? 



The reason we can presume that media will, as David Burge, @IowaHawkBlog on X famously says, smother this story with a pillow until it quits moving is because Fox News' Bill Melugin, an actual reporter, has already got the 411 on the subhuman who threw a couple firebombs into a crowd. 





Illegal immigrant on a visa overstay bringing global jihad to Boulder, you say? That's the end of that story if you're employed at CNN or MSNBC. Cannot wait for Colorado Senator Michael Bennet's CODEL to Egypt to try to spring his constituent free from prison in a few weeks. 



Don't tell me there is no media bias. There is good reporting in Original Sin, but it is far from complete reporting. It's C-Y-A reportage, and ignores the aiding, abetting, and culpability of the media. And the next time a member of the media tells you there's no bias, excusing away every instance of an ideological slant always leftward, be it promotion or protection, know you're being gaslit.

The suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was charged in the attack that injured eight people, some with burns, as a group was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Witnesses reported the man yelled ""Free Palestine"" during the attack.

An FBI affidavit, released in support of the federal hate crime charge filed by the Justice Department on Monday, says Mohammed Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again.

In response to the attack, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday that the attack ""WILL NOT BE TOLERATED"" in the U.S.

Trump said that the suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who is currently in the country after overstaying a tourist visa, came into the U.S. through former U.S. President Joe Biden's ""ridiculous Open Border Policy,"" which he said has hurt the U.S. ""badly.""

""He must go out under 'TRUMP' Policy,"" he wrote, adding that acts of terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. ""This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders secure and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our homeland,"" he continued.

While offering condolences to the victims and ""the great people of Boulder, Colorado,"" Trump did not mention Israel, the hostages, or any possible expressions of antisemitism related to the attack.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold-blooded perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law.""

""The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,"" he said.

President Isaac Herzog also issued his condolences to the victims while speaking to U.S. Jewish community leaders, saying, ""This vile act of terror is a painful reminder that antisemitism knows no borders,"" adding that it serves as a reminder that the ""American and Israeli people stand united to bring the hostages homeland ensure no Jew, anywhere, stands alone.""",

(AP) — Four additional victims have been identified in the Boulder attack in which a man is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails into a group that had gathered to bring attention to Israeli hostages in Gaza, authorities said Monday, bringing the number of injured to 12.

The man planned the attack for more than a year and specifically targeted what he described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime.

Witnesses in Boulder said the suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, yelled “Free Palestine” and used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices.

Federal and state prosecutors filed separate criminal cases against Soliman, charging him with a hate crime and attempted murder, respectively. He faces additional state charges related to the incendiary devices, and more charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment that may include amended allegations.

An FBI affidavit says Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

“He said he had to do it, he should do it, and he would not forgive himself if he did not do it,” police wrote. “Mohamed described his hopes for everyone in the Zionist group to die.”

Federal court records don’t list the name of an attorney who could speak on Soliman’s behalf and no one answered the door at a Colorado Springs townhouse where public records show he lived.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. The attack happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

The victims who were wounded range in age from 52 to 88 and the injuries spanned from serious to minor, officials said. All four of the latest victims suffered what police described as minor injuries.

Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organizer connected to the group. She said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalized caught on fire.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives was concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza. Video from the scene shows a witness shouting, “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advances on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante of San Diego said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a “boom” followed by people yelling and screaming.

In video of the scene captured by Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.

Soliman said he dressed up like gardener with an orange vest in order to get as close to the group as possible, even purchasing flowers from Home Depot, police wrote. He had gas in a backpack sprayer but told investigators he didn’t spray it on anyone but himself “because he had planned on dying.”

He told investigators he only threw two Molotov cocktails at the group “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” police wrote.

After the initial attack, Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then reemerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it. The man then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived. The man dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video Osante filmed.

District Attorney Michael Dougherty said 16 unused Molotov cocktails were recovered by law enforcement. The devices were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the them, the FBI said.

Inside his car, law enforcement found papers with the words “Israel,” “Palestine,” and “USAID,” the affidavit says.

Soliman told investigators he constructed homemade Molotov cocktails after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.

“He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack,” the affidavit says.

Authorities said they believe Soliman acted alone. He was also injured and taken to a hospital. Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries, but a booking photo showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

Soliman was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X. McLaughlin said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023 that had expired. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for additional information.

Soliman, who was born in Egypt, moved to Colorado Springs three years ago, where he lived with his wife and five kids, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his wife as kindly neighbors with three young kids and two teenagers, who’d play with Pruiett’s kids.

Another neighbor, Kierra Johnson, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman’s home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett.

An online resume under Soliman’s name said he was employed by a Denver-area health care company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt. Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic center for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.

Israel’s war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants.

Soliman, 45, is accused of hurling Molotov cocktails and blasting a makeshift flamethrower at elderly participants in a weekly walk on Pearl Street that calls for the release of 58 Israeli hostages held by Hamas. 12 people were injured, including a Holocaust survivor; one victim remained in critical condition on Monday evening, police said.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is treating the incident as a suspected lone-actor hate crime. Court filings show that Soliman entered the United States on a B-1/B-2 tourist visa in August 2022, overstayed when it expired in February 2023 and received a one-year work permit that lapsed this past March. Homeland Security officials said he had made a failed asylum attempt in 2005. He is being held in Boulder County Jail on five felony counts, including attempted first-degree murder and use of incendiary devices, with bail set at $10 million.

Several pro-government talk shows echoed the report, arguing that the Boulder flames reflected what they called a pattern of Brotherhood-inspired violence exported abroad since the movement was banned in Egypt in 2013. While commentators uniformly condemned the assault as terrorism, they insisted it underscored the need for Western governments to keep the Brotherhood on terror watch lists.

US law enforcement agencies have not commented on Soliman’s political affiliations. A spokesperson for the FBI’s Denver field office declined to discuss “any associations or material support” while the investigation is under way.

The Anti-Defamation League noted that fringe Arabic-language social-media accounts praised Soliman as a “hero,” but said mainstream Arab outlets reported the attack as straight crime news. “The Egyptian media focus on the Brotherhood is a domestic political lens, not a reflection of verified facts,” an ADL statement said.

Egyptian newspapers also highlighted that Soliman’s US visa was issued after 2021, with columnists faulting what they called lax American screening. A front-page editorial in the state-run Al-Gomhuria urged Washington to “re-examine its hospitality to extremists,” while a commentator on Ten TV cited the case as proof that “Brotherhood ideology remains a global threat if left unchecked.”

US President Donald Trump echoed the theme on Truth Social, writing that the attack showed why “the Muslim Brotherhood must stay banned and its sympathisers removed.” The Egyptian Foreign Ministry, for its part, condemned the Boulder assault and said its embassy in Washington had supplied US authorities with “open-source references to the suspect’s online activity.”

Run For Their Lives, the Colorado-based group whose march was targeted, vowed to continue walking every Sunday until the hostages are freed. “Terror will not silence us,” the group said in a statement.","US President Donald Trump echoed the theme on Truth Social, writing that the attack showed why “the Muslim Brotherhood must stay banned and its sympathisers removed.”"

One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, according to a local rabbi. Jewish leaders nationwide are demanding greater government action to protect the community, which is still reeling just two weeks after the killing in Washington, D.C., of two young staff of the Israeli embassy, gunned down outside an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee.

The anti-Semitic motivation of these attacks is clear. Such homicidal hate crimes have no justification; indeed, their collateral damage is to destroy the space for any reasonable debate about how Israel has conducted its war in Gaza. The two attacks are linked not only by their motivation, but by their horrific, performative intimacy. Terrorism always aims to shock with the gruesomeness of bloody murder—one thinks of the Islamic State decapitation videos. Yet terrorism typically wields the threat of random violence, the notion that any innocent might be caught in its vortex of cruelty. These attacks are different because they were directed very specifically at people the attacker took to be Jewish. Their intimacy was precisely intended to inflict horror on a particular community and imply that no Jew could be innocent.

In Boulder, the suspect in police custody has been charged with a federal hate crime. He has been named as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, and used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to burn his victims. He reportedly yelled “Free Palestine!” during the attack. The attacker’s method had an improvised yet theatrical quality; even if its symbolism was not consciously intended, the effort to incinerate Jews has a hideous historical echo.

In the case of the D.C. attack, the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, drove from Chicago to the Capital Jewish Museum. There, he allegedly found and killed two Israeli embassy staff—according to reports, shooting his victims multiple times like a mob executioner. Authorities say the suspect also chanted “Free, free Palestine” when he was detained, adding, “I did it for Gaza.”

Pervasive anti-Semitism is what enables attackers to believe that they are striking back at Israel by trying to kill any Jew, anywhere. This hateful mindset assigns responsibility for specific Israeli policies to Jewish people all over the world. Jews thus stand condemned purely for being Jewish. This is a sure tell of anti-Semitic unreason—given that neither American Jews, nor Israelis themselves, are of one mind on anything, let alone the Netanyahu government’s Gaza policy.

The Colorado victims were meeting in support of hostages taken by Hamas. The D.C. victims were working to advance their embassy’s diplomatic mission. Both sets of people belonged to the best traditions of dialogue and peaceful advocacy, the absolute opposite of irrational hate. The personal, proximate violence that these attackers used was designed to create a spectacle that makes all Jewish Americans feel vulnerable.

Both alleged perpetrators pointedly had no intention of trying to escape from the scene of these crimes. The attacker in D.C., after all, concluded his attack by going into the Capital Jewish Museum, where people aided him, thinking that he was seeking refuge from the violence outside; he was detained only after he identified himself as the assailant and yelled pro-Palestinian slogans. The Boulder suspect was easily detained after witnesses identified him to arriving authorities. The premise of these attackers’ grotesque performance is that killing Jews, any Jews, is justified and good. Terrorism usually seeks to cloak its hate in a higher cause. But these recent attacks dispense with the pretense. “Free Palestine,” in the mouth of these attackers, is a threat of extermination, the expression of an eliminationist project. With the horrible intimacy of their point-blank shooting or flamethrower immolation, the perpetrators appear to think they have begun that project. Although a graphic description of these attacks—a fleeing victim hunted down or burned alive—may risk the crimes’ glorification or mimicry, their qualitative horror should not be glossed over.

As far as we know, these assailants are not part of a larger terrorist scheme. The “lone wolf” phenomenon makes preventing this kind of violence more difficult; with no organizational footprint for intelligence services to track, nothing in the profile of either suspect raises any obvious flag that would have provided a possible warning of such an attack. Buttressing support and protections for the Jewish community is important, but will be imperfect. The solution is simply to delegitimize, constantly and forcefully, these acts—without qualification or broader discussion. Public discourse must maintain a strong distinction between what Israel does and who Jews are. To do otherwise is to side with this terror.",The latest attacks on Jews in America inevitably betray their real motive: sheer hate.

One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, according to a local rabbi. Jewish leaders nationwide are demanding greater government action to protect the community, which is still reeling just two weeks after the killing in Washington, D.C., of two young staff of the Israeli embassy, gunned down outside an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee.

The anti-Semitic motivation of these attacks is clear. Such homicidal hate crimes have no justification; indeed, their collateral damage is to destroy the space for any reasonable debate about how Israel has conducted its war in Gaza. The two attacks are linked not only by their motivation, but by their horrific, performative intimacy. Terrorism always aims to shock with the gruesomeness of bloody murder—one thinks of the Islamic State decapitation videos. Yet terrorism typically wields the threat of random violence, the notion that any innocent might be caught in its vortex of cruelty. These attacks are different because they were directed very specifically at people the attacker took to be Jewish. Their intimacy was precisely intended to inflict horror on a particular community and imply that no Jew could be innocent.

In Boulder, the suspect in police custody has been charged with a federal hate crime. He has been named as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, and used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to burn his victims. He reportedly yelled “Free Palestine!” during the attack. The attacker’s method had an improvised yet theatrical quality; even if its symbolism was not consciously intended, the effort to incinerate Jews has a hideous historical echo.

In the case of the D.C. attack, the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, drove from Chicago to the Capital Jewish Museum. There, he allegedly found and killed two Israeli embassy staff—according to reports, shooting his victims multiple times like a mob executioner. Authorities say the suspect also chanted “Free, free Palestine” when he was detained, adding, “I did it for Gaza.”

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years old were transported to hospitals, Boulder police said. Authorities had earlier put the count of the injured at six and said at least one of them was in a critical condition.

“As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,” the FBI special agent in charge of the Denver Field Office, Mark Michalek, said.

Michalek named the suspect as Mohamed Soliman, who was hospitalized shortly after the attack. Reuters could not immediately locate contact information for him or his family.

FBI Director Kash Patel also described the incident as a “targeted terror attack,” and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said it appeared to be “a hate crime given the group that was targeted.” Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he did not believe anyone else was involved.

“We’re fairly confident we have the lone suspect in custody,” he said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district in the shadow of the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

In a statement, the group said the walks have been held every week since then for the hostages, “without any violent incidents until today.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked “simply because they were Jews” and that he trusted US authorities would prosecute “the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law.”

“The antisemitic attacks around the world are a direct result of blood libels against the Jewish state and people, and this must be stopped,” he said.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the United States over Israel’s war in Gaza, which has spurred both an increase in antisemitic hate crime as well as moves by conservative supporters of Israel, led by President Donald Trump, to brand pro-Palestinian protests as antisemitic. His administration has detained protesters of the war without charge and cut off funding to elite US universities that have permitted such demonstrations.

In a post to X, a social network, Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Soliman had overstayed his visa and been allowed to work by the previous administration. He said it was further evidence of the need to “fully reverse” what he described as “suicidal migration.”

Reuters was not able to independently verify the suspect’s immigration status. When asked about Soliman, the Department of Homeland Security said more information would be provided as it became available.

Brooke Coffman, a 19-year-old at the University of Colorado who witnessed the Boulder incident, said she saw four women lying or sitting on the ground with burns on their legs. One of them appeared to have been badly burned on most of her body and had been wrapped in a flag by someone, she said.

She described seeing a man whom she presumed to be the attacker standing in the courtyard shirtless, holding a glass bottle of clear liquid and shouting.

“Everybody is yelling, ‘get water, get water,'” Coffman said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said it was an antisemitic attack.

“This is horrifying, and this cannot continue. We must stand up to antisemitism,” he said on X.

The attack follows last month’s arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C. Someone opened fire on a group of people leaving an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.

The shooting fueled polarization in the United States over the war in Gaza between supporters of Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators.

In Boulder, the suspect in police custody has been charged with a federal hate crime. He has been named as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, and used a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to burn his victims. He reportedly yelled “Free Palestine!” during the attack. The attacker’s method had an improvised yet theatrical quality; even if its symbolism was not consciously intended, the effort to incinerate Jews has a hideous historical echo.

In the case of the D.C. attack, the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, drove from Chicago to the Capital Jewish Museum. There, he allegedly found and killed two Israeli embassy staff—according to reports, shooting his victims multiple times like a mob executioner. Authorities say the suspect also chanted “Free, free Palestine” when he was detained, adding, “I did it for Gaza.”

Pervasive anti-Semitism is what enables attackers to believe that they are striking back at Israel by trying to kill any Jew, anywhere. This hateful mindset assigns responsibility for specific Israeli policies to Jewish people all over the world. Jews thus stand condemned purely for being Jewish. This is a sure tell of anti-Semitic unreason—given that neither American Jews, nor Israelis themselves, are of one mind on anything, let alone the Netanyahu government’s Gaza policy.

The Colorado victims were meeting in support of hostages taken by Hamas. The D.C. victims were working to advance their embassy’s diplomatic mission. Both sets of people belonged to the best traditions of dialogue and peaceful advocacy, the absolute opposite of irrational hate. The personal, proximate violence that these attackers used was designed to create a spectacle that makes all Jewish Americans feel vulnerable.

Both alleged perpetrators pointedly had no intention of trying to escape from the scene of these crimes. The attacker in D.C., after all, concluded his attack by going into the Capital Jewish Museum, where people aided him, thinking that he was seeking refuge from the violence outside; he was detained only after he identified himself as the assailant and yelled pro-Palestinian slogans. The Boulder suspect was easily detained after witnesses identified him to arriving authorities. The premise of these attackers’ grotesque performance is that killing Jews, any Jews, is justified and good. Terrorism usually seeks to cloak its hate in a higher cause. But these recent attacks dispense with the pretense. “Free Palestine,” in the mouth of these attackers, is a threat of extermination, the expression of an eliminationist project. With the horrible intimacy of their point-blank shooting or flamethrower immolation, the perpetrators appear to think they have begun that project. Although a graphic description of these attacks—a fleeing victim hunted down or burned alive—may risk the crimes’ glorification or mimicry, their qualitative horror should not be glossed over.

As far as we know, these assailants are not part of a larger terrorist scheme.

One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, according to a local rabbi. Jewish leaders nationwide are demanding greater government action to protect the community, which is still reeling just two weeks after the killing in Washington, D.C., of two young staff of the Israeli embassy, gunned down outside an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee.

The anti-Semitic motivation of these attacks is clear. Such homicidal hate crimes have no justification; indeed, their collateral damage is to destroy the space for any reasonable debate about how Israel has conducted its war in Gaza. The two attacks are linked not only by their motivation, but by their horrific, performative intimacy. Terrorism always aims to shock with the gruesomeness of bloody murder—one thinks of the Islamic State decapitation videos. Yet terrorism typically wields the threat of random violence, the notion that any innocent might be caught in its vortex of cruelty. These attacks are different because they were directed very specifically at people the attacker took to be Jewish. Their intimacy was precisely intended to inflict horror on a particular community and imply that no Jew could be innocent.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, faces hate crime charges in federal court and attempted murder and other charges in state court.

Soliman — whose first name also was spelled Mohammed in some court documents — had 18 Molotov cocktails but threw just two during Sunday’s attack in which he yelled “Free Palestine,” police said. He didn’t carry out his full plan “because he got scared and had never hurt anyone before,” police wrote in an affidavit.

The two incendiary devices he did throw into the group of about 20 people were enough to injure more than half of them, and authorities said he expressed no regrets about the attack.

What’s next for the suspect?

Soliman was being held Tuesday on a $10 million, cash-only bond, according to prosecutors. He’s due back in a Boulder County courtroom Thursday. More charges are possible in federal court, where the Justice Department will seek a grand jury indictment.

Public defender Kathryn Herold is representing Soliman. She declined to comment after Monday’s hearing where he officially was charged.

Soliman was born in Egypt and he moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, where he lived with his wife and five children, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

He was living in the U.S. illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on the social platform X.

Soliman’s wife and five children were taken into custody Tuesday by federal immigration authorities and were being processed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said a DHS official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

Federal officials are investigating whether Soliman’s family knew about his plan, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a post on X.

Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew about his plans, according to court documents.

What was the motive behind the attack?

Soliman told the police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people,” according to an FBI affidavit. Zionism is a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel.

Sunday’s attack at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall in downtown Boulder had been planned for more than a year and specifically targeted what Soliman described as a “Zionist group,” authorities said in court papers charging him with a federal hate crime.

That charge carries a sentence of life in prison when it includes attempted murder. Colorado state charges include 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of using an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

The attack came on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and as the Israel-Hamas war continues to inflame global tensions. The war has contributed to a spike in antisemitism in the United States. The Boulder attack was barely a week after a man who also yelled ""Free Palestine"" was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

“This attack was not random. It was a deliberate hate crime against the Jewish community that was planned for months,"" Sen. John Hickenlooper said Tuesday on Senate floor in the U.S. Capitol referring to Boulder attack.

“The scope of that hatred is unconscionable,” continued Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat. “These were men and women who dedicated their time to advocating for innocent hostages, who have been now held in captivity for over 600 days.”

After reports of the attack circulated and around the time of the first police briefing, FBI director Kash Patel said on X that the agency was investigating a “targeted terror attack” in Boulder.

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said he initially suspected terrorism. However, investigators were still trying to piece together what happened by interviewing the suspect and witnesses and looking at videos of the attack. Redfearn did not want to say anything that turned out to be wrong and compromise the prosecution of Soliman.

He said Tuesday that police were aware of reports that Soliman had said “Free Palestine” and also of videos showing details of what had happened. But he said police, at that time, were scouring them mainly to see if there was a second suspect, which some initially thought, so that person could be found and stopped from hurting anyone else.

“There was no intent to hide what happened,” Redfearn said. “There was no intent to minimize or lessen what we later, within a couple of hours at the press conference, confirmed was terrorism. It was, it was. Strictly the intent was to make sure we had everything right before we committed to one thing or another.”

Who are the demonstrators?

The 12 people hurt in the attack are demonstrators with Run for Their Lives. The events have been staged globally since 2023 and call for Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Organizers say the walk in Boulder was the first in which they have faced violence.

The weekly demonstration Sunday was wrapping up when the crowd was attacked with a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails, authorities said.

Police liaisons assigned to the victims said none were ready to speak Monday with reporters. They range in age from 52 to 88, and their injuries spanned from serious to minor.

Three people remained hospitalized Tuesday at the UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus, spokesperson Kelli Christensen said. Christensen declined to provide information on their conditions and said they are currently declining media interviews and have requested privacy.

U.S. supporters of the Israeli hostages say they’re scared but have vowed to keep demonstrating.

According to Huckabee, such reporting has contributed to a climate of antisemitism in the United States, including the murder of two young people at an Israeli Embassy event in Washington last month and an attempted murder and terror attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Colorado on Sunday.

""Reckless and irresponsible reporting by major U.S. news outlets are contributing to the antisemitic climate that has resulted in the murder of two young people at an Israeli Embassy event in Washington last month and the attempted murder and terror attack on a group of pro-Israel demonstrators in Colorado on Sunday,"" Huckabee stated.

Huckabee specifically named *The New York Times*, CNN, and the Associated Press, accusing them of reporting “without verification of any source other than Hamas and its collaborators.” He referenced recent coverage alleging that individuals seeking humanitarian food aid from the Gaza Humanitarian Fund were shot or killed by the Israeli Defense Forces.

“These reports were FALSE,” Huckabee said. “Drone video and first-hand accounts clearly showed that there were no injuries, no fatalities, no shooting, no chaos. It is Hamas that continues to terrorize and intimidate those who seek food aid.”

He asserted that the stories originated solely from Hamas sources and claimed they were “misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated.” According to Huckabee, the dissemination of these stories is “designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States.”

“Media sources who willingly parrot these libelous allegations should recant their fake news stories, apologize, and pledge to practice actual reporting of fact instead of engaging in dangerous propaganda that assists the terror group Hamas as they continue to hold innocent hostages for over 600 days after butchering over 1,200 people on October 7th,” he added.

Huckabee highlighted that the Gaza Humanitarian Fund has successfully delivered over 5 million meals to civilians “without incident.”

“For the *New York Times*, AP, and CNN to be part of a Hamas-fed false narrative is reprehensible,” he said. “It represents more than mere sloppy journalism. It’s feeding and inciting violence against innocent people in the United States.”

Huckabee blames media for DC and Colorado attacks,"In a strongly worded statement, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee criticized major American media outlets for what he described as “reckless and irresponsible reporting” on events in Gaza. According to Huckabee, such reporting has contributed to a climate of antisemitism in the United States, including the murder of two young people at an Israeli Embassy event in Washington last month and an attempted murder and terror attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Colorado on Sunday.

""Reckless and irresponsible reporting by major U.S. news outlets are contributing to the antisemitic climate that has resulted in the murder of two young people at an Israeli Embassy event in Washington last month and the attempted murder and terror attack on a group of pro-Israel demonstrators in Colorado on Sunday,"" Huckabee stated.

Huckabee specifically named *The New York Times*, CNN, and the Associated Press, accusing them of reporting “without verification of any source other than Hamas and its collaborators.” He referenced recent coverage alleging that individuals seeking humanitarian food aid from the Gaza Humanitarian Fund were shot or killed by the Israeli Defense Forces.

“These reports were FALSE,” Huckabee said. “Drone video and first-hand accounts clearly showed that there were no injuries, no fatalities, no shooting, no chaos. It is Hamas that continues to terrorize and intimidate those who seek food aid.”

He asserted that the stories originated solely from Hamas sources and claimed they were “misleading, exaggerated, and utterly fabricated.” According to Huckabee, the dissemination of these stories is “designed to fan the flames of antisemitic hate that is arguably contributing to violence against Jews in the United States.”

“Media sources who willingly parrot these libelous allegations should recant their fake news stories, apologize, and pledge to practice actual reporting of fact instead of engaging in dangerous propaganda that assists the terror group Hamas as they continue to hold innocent hostages for over 600 days after butchering over 1,200 people on October 7th,” he added.

Huckabee highlighted that the Gaza Humanitarian Fund has successfully delivered over 5 million meals to civilians “without incident.”

“For the *New York Times*, AP, and CNN to be part of a Hamas-fed false narrative is reprehensible,” he said. “It represents more than mere sloppy journalism. It’s feeding and inciting violence against innocent people in the United States.”

He concluded by calling for immediate action from the media: “We are demanding an immediate retraction of the lies and are appealing to all media sources to act with objective professionalism to cover actual events instead of being a partner of terrorism by blindly following Hamas news releases.”","U.S. Ambassador to Israel: ""Reckless and irresponsible reporting by major U.S. news outlets are contributing to the antisemitic climate that has resulted in the murder in DC and the attack in Colorado"""

Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Mark Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office, characterized the incident as a “targeted act of violence” and said in a Sunday evening news briefing that it’s under investigation as terrorism, echoing a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel earlier in the day.

Police arrested Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of El Paso County, after bystanders pointed him out to police officers outside the Boulder County Courthouse, Michalek said.

Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary device into the crowd gathered outside the courthouse to harm them, Michalek said, adding that the suspect yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack.

Videos showed people rushing to pour water on one victim while others lay collapsed nearby.

“It’s almost like it was a gun of fire,” said Lynn Segal, who witnessed the attack. “It’s like a line of fire.”

Police and the FBI initially said six people were injured in the attack, but law enforcement officials increased that tally to eight late Sunday night.

The victims include four women and four men between the ages of 52 and 88, according to Boulder police and the FBI. Authorities initially said four people were taken to the Boulder Community Health hospital, and two others were airlifted to UCHealth University of Colorado’s burn unit in Aurora with more severe injuries.

Police arrested a shirtless man at the scene, who was shown in videos posted to social media holding glass bottles and shouting “Free Palestine” and calling to “end Zionists.”

Asked about Soliman’s affiliations with any other groups, Boulder police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the investigation – which includes the FBI – was ongoing, though he said authorities were almost certain that the suspect acted alone.","The Denver Post (""8 people set on fire in ‘targeted act of violence’ on Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall""):Eight people marching in support of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were burned Sunday by a man wielding what authorities called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.The attack"

Title IX was enacted into law on June 23 in 1972, so President Donald Trump’s Department of Education will celebrate June as Title IX month.

Secretary of Education Linda McMahon is overseeing investigations into two reputed Title IX violations said to have taken place under the Biden administration.

The Education Department will investigate the University of Wyoming for allowing a transgender-identifying male into the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.

Even though Kappa’s bylaws say only women can join the sorority, in fall of 2022, the University of Wyoming chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma was required to admit a biological male member who identifies as female.

Represented by Independent Women’s Forum, several sorority members sued the national Kappa branch.

The second investigation is into Jefferson County Public Schools in Colorado, which allowed its high school overnight accommodations to be determined by gender identity, rather than sex, leading to a male sharing a room with a female.

Joe and Serena Wailes revealed in 2023 that their 11-year-old daughter was assigned to share a bed with a boy who identifies as a transgender girl on an overnight school trip. Their story led other parents to come forward with similar allegations.

Protecting Title IX’s original intent has been a priority of the Trump Department of Education.

The Department of Education under the Biden-Harris administration issued new rules, reinterpreting Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the law that bars discrimination on the basis of sex in education.

The rewrite would have changed the meaning of “sex” in Title IX to include “gender identity.”

The Biden administration withdrew the proposed rule at the end of December, in the face of receiving hundreds of thousands of critical public comments.",The Department of Education is announcing investigations into two violations of the law protecting women's spaces and sports.

U.S. residents are recommended to get measles-mumps-rubella shots, anyway. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously emphasized the importance of vaccination for travelers going to countries with outbreaks.

Last week, the CDC updated its guidance to call for vaccinations for travelers going to all other countries.

An Colorado outbreak last month stemmed from an international flight that landed in Denver, she noted. The CDC travel notice change reflects a recognition that people are not just being exposed to measles in countries where it's spreading, but also in airplanes and during travel, she added.

“We're seeing a shift from localized outbreaks to transmission in transit,” and the CDC seems to be responding to that, Darcy-Mahoney said.

The travel notice advises two doses for all Americans ages 1 and older. An early dose is advised for traveling infants ages 6 months to 11 months. The U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases so far this year.

Pam Bondi: Not So Fast.,"The Department of Justice today announced federal hate crime charges against illegal alien Mohammed Sabry Soliman, who tried to set Jews on fire in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday.

Soliman, who is in the country illegally, thanks to Joe Biden's lax border policies, attacked a group called ""Run For Their Lives,"" which organizes weekly walks to bring attention to the hostages still being held by Hamas terrorists.

The criminal complaint alleges that the suspect threw ""Molotov cocktails into a pro-Israel crowd while yelling 'Free Palestine' and injuring eight individuals.""

SOLIMAN was detained by local law enforcement. A black plastic container with a yellow top was found near where SOLIMAN was arrested. In the black plastic container were at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Ball jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles. Near the black plastic container was a backpack weed sprayer, potentially containing a flammable substance. The clear liquid in the glass bottles and weed sprayer were determined to be 87 octane gasoline, which was determined to contain xylene based on a field test.

According to the CDC, ""Xylene is a colorless, sweet-smelling liquid that catches on fire easily.""

Law enforcement officials said they saw a ""red material consistent with the rags found in the black plastic container; a red gas container; and paperwork with the words, 'Israel,' 'Palestine,' and 'USAID'"" when they looked inside his vehicle, which was parked nearby. Officials moved the vehicle to the FBI Denver facility for further investigation.

During his interrogation, the monster admitted that ""he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead.""

Throughout the interview, SOLIMAN stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over “our land,” which he explained to be Palestine. He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.

He told investigators that he would do it again if given the chance.

Related: Antisemitism Is Here. So Is the Bear Jew Option.

The FBI is examining a journal and an iPhone found in Soliman's home, as well as a storage facility identified by a neighbor.

Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement, ""The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Our prayers are with the victims and our Jewish community across the world.""

The DOJ statement notes, ""This vile anti-Semitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC. We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.""

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon added, ""No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice. There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.""

In addition to state charges in Colorado, Soliman now faces ""one count of a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.""

Let's hope this terrorist never takes another breath of free American air for the rest of his life.

U.S. residents are recommended to get measles-mumps-rubella shots, anyway. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously emphasized the importance of vaccination for travelers going to countries with outbreaks.

Last week, the CDC updated its guidance to call for vaccinations for travelers going to all other countries.

An Colorado outbreak last month stemmed from an international flight that landed in Denver, she noted. The CDC travel notice change reflects a recognition that people are not just being exposed to measles in countries where it's spreading, but also in airplanes and during travel, she added.

“We're seeing a shift from localized outbreaks to transmission in transit,” and the CDC seems to be responding to that, Darcy-Mahoney said.

The travel notice advises two doses for all Americans ages 1 and older. An early dose is advised for traveling infants ages 6 months to 11 months. The U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases so far this year.

Pam Bondi: Not So Fast.,"The Department of Justice today announced federal hate crime charges against illegal alien Mohammed Sabry Soliman, who tried to set Jews on fire in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday.

Soliman, who is in the country illegally, thanks to Joe Biden's lax border policies, attacked a group called ""Run For Their Lives,"" which organizes weekly walks to bring attention to the hostages still being held by Hamas terrorists.

The criminal complaint alleges that the suspect threw ""Molotov cocktails into a pro-Israel crowd while yelling 'Free Palestine' and injuring eight individuals.""

SOLIMAN was detained by local law enforcement. A black plastic container with a yellow top was found near where SOLIMAN was arrested. In the black plastic container were at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Ball jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles. Near the black plastic container was a backpack weed sprayer, potentially containing a flammable substance. The clear liquid in the glass bottles and weed sprayer were determined to be 87 octane gasoline, which was determined to contain xylene based on a field test.

According to the CDC, ""Xylene is a colorless, sweet-smelling liquid that catches on fire easily.""

Law enforcement officials said they saw a ""red material consistent with the rags found in the black plastic container; a red gas container; and paperwork with the words, 'Israel,' 'Palestine,' and 'USAID'"" when they looked inside his vehicle, which was parked nearby. Officials moved the vehicle to the FBI Denver facility for further investigation.

During his interrogation, the monster admitted that ""he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead.""

Throughout the interview, SOLIMAN stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over “our land,” which he explained to be Palestine. He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.

He told investigators that he would do it again if given the chance.

The FBI is examining a journal and an iPhone found in Soliman's home, as well as a storage facility identified by a neighbor.

Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement, ""The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Our prayers are with the victims and our Jewish community across the world.""

According to a federal complaint, Mohamed Soliman, 45, threw the items into the crowd while yelling ""Free Palestine."" The documents say he's charged with a hate crime for an act of violence involving someone's perceived or actual race, religion or national origin. The charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the suspect is being held on dozens of state charges, including multiple counts of attempted murder, use of an incendiary device, and attempted use of an incendiary device. He is being held on $10 million cash-only bond on those charges, Dougherty said.

Miri Kornfeld, an organizer with the group that was attacked, said they hold weekly walks to raise awareness of Israeli hostages. She said they were walking on Pearl Street on Sunday afternoon and that the man was waiting for them when they arrived at the courthouse.

Soliman was pointed out by witnesses and detained at the scene. According to federal court documents, a black plastic container with a yellow top was found near him. In the black plastic container were unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or jars that contained clear liquid. Each one had red rags hanging out of them.

Soliman, who lives in Colorado Springs with his wife and five children, said he drove to Boulder and threw two of them at the people who were participating in the march. He said he ""wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,"" the federal complaint says, and went on to say he would do it again.

Throughout the interview with investigators, Soliman said he ""hated"" the Zionist group and carried out the attack because he needed to stop them from taking over ""our land,"" which he explained to be Palestine, the complaint says.

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.""

“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon, and my wife Andrea and I are praying for the victims,"" Neguse said. ""Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence. We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”","The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, told investigators he researched how to make Molotov cocktails and targeted the group in Boulder after finding out about them online."

Mohamed Soliman is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and using a makeshift flamethrower on a group of people at a rally in support of Israeli hostages - with the FBI describing the incident as a targeted ""act of terrorism"".

The 45-year-old, from El Paso County, Colorado, yelled ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, it is alleged.

Soliman has been charged with the federal crime of causing bodily injury because of actual or perceived race, colour, religion, or national origin. Authorities said they would announce further charges later on Monday.

Four women and four men, aged between 52 and 88, were injured and taken to hospitals. One victim is in a critical condition and others were seriously hurt, authorities said.

In a federal criminal complaint, investigators said Soliman confessed to the attack and told them that he had planned it for a year.

The alleged attacker said he researched on YouTube how to make Molotov cocktails - an improvised bomb made from a bottle filled with petrol and stuffed with a piece of cloth to use as a fuse, it was claimed.

He allegedly made them before driving to Boulder, Colorado, to carry out the attack on the weekly demonstration, where people were calling for release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Soliman told investigators he ""wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead"", and ""he would do it (conduct an attack) again"", according to the criminal complaint.

The suspect said he had been planning the attack for a year, and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to carry it out, it was alleged.

According to the federal complaint, officers found a black plastic container with a yellow top near where Soliman was arrested, containing ""at least 14 unlit Molotov cocktails"".

Investigators said the projectiles were comprised of ""glass wine carafe bottles or Ball jars,"" and that near the container ""was a backpack weed sprayer, potentially containing a flammable substance"".

It was later determined the liquid in both the bottles and weed sprayer was the flammable liquid xylene, the complaint said.

Mark Michalek, a special agent in charge of the FBI's Denver field office, described the sprayer as a ""makeshift flamethrower"".

Law enforcement officials told Sky News' US partner network NBC News that Soliman is an Egyptian national who seemingly acted alone. They said he has no previous significant contact with law enforcement.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said Soliman was in the US ""illegally"".

She posted on X: ""He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.""

US President Donald Trump said the ""horrific"" attack in Boulder ""will not be tolerated in the United States of America"".

Police chief Steve Redfearn said the attack happened at around 1.26pm local time on Sunday and initial reports were that ""people were being set on fire"".

""When we arrived we encountered multiple victims that were injured, with injuries consistent with burns,"" Mr Redfearn said.

The attack happened as a ""group of pro-Israel people"" were peacefully demonstrating, police said.

The walk is held regularly by a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives, which aims to raise awareness of the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was praying for the full recovery of the people wounded in the ""vicious terror attack"" in Colorado.

""This attack was aimed against peaceful people who wished to express their solidarity with the hostages held by Hamas, simply because they were Jews,"" he said.

US Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a prominent Jewish Democrat, said the attack was ""horrifying"" and ""this cannot continue"", adding: ""We must stand up to antisemitism.""

The attack follows the arrest of a Chicago-born man in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington DC two weeks ago.","The FBI described the incident as a targeted ""act of terrorism"" and named the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman from El Paso County, Colorado."

Eight people, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were injured in the attack with two in serious condition being airlifted to a hospital in Aurora. One of the injured is a Holocaust survivor.

“This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war,” said Executive Director of the University of Boulder Hillel, Elyanna Funk. “These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”



The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was pointed out by witnesses at the scene. According to a store owner who spoke to CNN, Soliman was seen as “pretty calm, pacing around with the spray bottles that were filled with some sort of flammable liquid.” Other witnesses allege that he yelled “Free Palestine!!” before using the incendiary devices at the “Run For Their Lives” event. Soliman, 45, was arrested on two counts of first-degree assault and crimes against at-risk adults or elderly people. He’s currently being held in the Boulder County Jail on a $10 million bond.

The FBI reportedly searched a home in an apartment complex in Colorado Springs with ties to Soliman, who neighbors said drove an Uber in Denver and wasn’t around that much according to local network KKTV 11 News. Neighbors expressed shock at the news. According to Department of Homeland Security, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin, Soliman was in the United States illegally. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, McLaughlin wrote,” He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.”





The incident comes after the shooting death of two Israeli embassy employees at an event held by the American Jewish Committee in Washington, D.C. The AJC is an advocacy group which supports Israel and combats antisemitism. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer described the attack as “horrifying” in a statement, and Colorado governor Jared Polls said in a statement, “My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror. Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable.”

Soliman on Sunday threw Molotov cocktails and used what the Times called a ""makeshift flamethrower"" on peaceful Boulder, Colo., demonstrators raising awareness for Hamas's hostages. Videos posted online show that he yelled, ""We have to end Zionists.""

The attack wounded eight victims between the ages of 52 and 88, police said. One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, a friend told Boulder's 9News.

President Donald Trump has cracked down on anti-Semitism, which surged in the United States under former president Joe Biden's watch. Trump has revoked visas of foreign nationals linked to anti-Semitic activity and withheld billions in federal funding from universities that fail to curb anti-Semitic protests on campus.

Trump has also ramped up deportations of illegal immigrants. Under border czar Tom Homan, ICE has arrested more than 158,000 illegal aliens, around 75 percent of whom have criminal convictions or pending charges, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The Times updated its article hours later with a statement from Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, who confirmed that Soliman is ""in the United States illegally, having entered in August 2022 on a tourist visa from Egypt and stayed past the visa’s expiration in February 2023.""

Michael Masters, Secure Community Network CEO: “It’s time to realize America is being threatened by Hamas supporters operating inside our country. Their goal is to kill Jews, just as was done on October 7th in Israel, but it likely won’t stop with Jews. Americans, from the President, every member of Congress, and elected officials everywhere, to all our citizens, must do more to fight this threat. If Nazi sympathizers carried out two successful attacks inside our country, all of us would be rightfully incensed and demand stronger actions. Two attacks are enough. What makes anyone think there won’t be a third attack, including one on non-Jews? An attack on the Jewish community is an attack on religious freedom and our democracy. It’s time for more action.”

 StandWithUs condemns the heinous June 1 attack in Boulder Colorado of peaceful members of the Jewish and non-Jewish community who were walking – as they’ve done every week since the brutal Hamas attack on October 7, 2023 – to raise awareness about the 58 remaining hostages held in horrendous conditions by Hamas in Gaza. Jews are under assault throughout the world and we call on our elected officials and community leaders to condemn these attacks by misguided people who blame Israel for defending themselves against the crimes the terror organization Hamas committed.

 Run For Their Lives: On June 1, 2025, our peaceful Run for Their Lives walk in Boulder, CO was brutally disrupted in a violent assault that Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is calling a hate crime. We are grateful to him and Colorado Governor Jared Polis for their immediate and decisive responses.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the eight burn victims from Sunday’s attack for a speedy recovery. We thank law enforcement and the fire department for their quick response and to the doctors and nurses working to heal.

Run for Their Lives is an apolitical global organization with the sole mission of walking peacefully to raise awareness for the 58 hostages still held in captivity by Hamas in Gaza. We are so thankful for our Run for Their Lives leaders and community members, who are all volunteers in our 230 groups worldwide.

This global grass roots organization was founded on October 15, 2023, a week after the horrendous terrorist attack by Hamas that left more than 1200 murdered, injured, raped and kidnapped. These walks have been held every week since then for all the hostages — without any violent incidents until Sunday.

The plight of the hostages is an international humanitarian crisis. The hostages, who hail from multiple countries, religions and ethnicities, have been held in the tunnels of Gaza without aid for more than 600 days. Reports indicate that at least 20 of them are still presumed to be alive, and we believe there is a collective responsibility to release them all.

We call on world leaders to do everything they can to ensure the swift return home of each of the 58 hostages. Run for Their Lives remains committed to our mission until ALL the HOSTAGES are returned back home!

 Brian Romick, president and CEO, Democratic Majority for Israel — “We’re anguished and alarmed by reports of a violent terror attack on members of the Jewish community in Boulder, CO who were walking to raise awareness about Israeli hostages still held by Hamas. This brazen attack comes less than two weeks after the murder of two Israeli Embassy officials outside of the Capital Jewish Museum. Jews must be able to gather safely in Boulder, Washington, D.C., and around the world.

“We wish those injured a speedy recovery, and call for those responsible to be held accountable.”

We strongly condemn yesterday’s unconscionable attack on a ‘Run for Their Lives’ hostage awareness event in Boulder, Colorado, and are sending our prayers to those injured in and affected by this horrific act of violence.

We are also deeply troubled by what appears to be a disturbing pattern of anti-Israel sentiment manifesting itself in antisemitic violence.

In April, a man used molotov cocktails, very similar to those used yesterday in Colorado, to target Governor Josh Shapiro’s home on Passover, citing his alleged concern for “Palestinian people.”

In May, a man targeted and killed two Israeli Embassy employees outside the Capital Jewish Museum because he believed they were Jewish. Once detained, he yelled “free, free Palestine.”

And yesterday, a man used homemade incendiary devices to burn eight peaceful demonstrators, aged 52-88, including a Holocaust survivor. At least one of the victims is in critical condition. The perpetrator of this attack yelled “free Palestine.”

These three attacks in the past two months are clear acts of antisemitic violence. This represents a deeply troubling pattern of such violence – possibly even copycat attacks – which must come to a decisive and immediate end.

The American Jewish community is in pain. We are mourning the loss of life and are reeling from violence. Arbitrarily attacking Jews only brings us all further from peace.

Every leader who claims to care about the safety of Jewish Americans should vigorously condemn these attacks and take action to defend against antisemitism in all its forms.

Since today is Shavuot, we know these attacks began 50 days ago, on Passover. Today it must end. We stand together against such violence and pain and send our prayers to all those harmed by these senseless acts of violence.

WASHINGTON – Within days, two antisemitic terrorist attacks in the U.S. have cast in stark relief the outcome of the normalization of hatred of the Jewish people. On May 21, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, staffers at the Israeli Embassy, were brutally murdered outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The shooter shouted, “Free, free Palestine.” Just 11 days later in Boulder, Colorado, a man yelling “Free Palestine” and “End Zionists” used a homemade incendiary device to viciously attack a peaceful march calling for the release of hostages of all nationalities held in Gaza for over 600 days. Several people remain hospitalized with life-threatening burns. One of the victims is an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor.

“Rarely in U.S. history has such murderous antisemitism been on display. These outrageous terrorist attacks reveal the antisemitism that drives those wanting to ‘globalize the intifada’ and pose an immediate threat to Jewish lives and the democratic foundations of our country,” said United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Chairman Stuart E. Eizenstat. “All sectors of society must unflinchingly confront antisemitism in all of its forms—including anti-Zionism—before it provokes more violence against innocent people. Unverified stories and conspiracy theories, rampant on social media and too often echoed in the press, preceded each of these attacks. The centuries-long portrayal of Jews as killers and predators—which the Nazis exploited to lay the groundwork for the Holocaust—makes clear the deadly consequences of this type of demonization.”

 Carol Ann Schwartz, Hadassah, The Women’s Zionist Organization of America, National President: “We are devastated to share that several members of our Hadassah community were injured in the antisemitic terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, as they participated in an event to remember the hostages kidnapped by Hamas. Our hearts are with all the victims of this horrific hate crime and with Jewish communities across the country who are feeling anxious and afraid to take part in everyday activities.

“This tragedy is a stark reminder of the alarming rise in antisemitic hatred and extremism, coming less than two weeks after the targeted murder of two young Israeli Embassy staffers leaving a Jewish event in Washington, DC. During this difficult time, we must take immediate action to address safety for the Jewish community and redouble our efforts to combat antisemitism in all forms.”

Sasha Roytman, CEO, Combat Antisemitism Movement: This morning, I woke up to an image I can’t forget.

In Boulder, Colorado, six elderly Jews (reported number increased to 8, then 12) — including a Holocaust survivor — were attacked with Molotov cocktails while peacefully gathering. A terrorist tried to burn them alive.

It’s horrifying. It’s unthinkable. To try to burn Jews alive — especially the elderly — in 2025!And in the name of Hamas. A terrorist group rooted in antisemitism and hatred.

But this wasn’t the only horror.

Just days ago, in Washington, D.C., two Israeli Embassy staff members, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum after attending a Jewish community event. The assailant, Elias Rodriguez, shouted “Free, free Palestine” during his arrest.

In France, on Saturday, two synagogues, a Jewish restaurant, and even the Holocaust Memorial in Paris were vandalized.

In Brisbane, Australia, on Saturday, a pro-Palestinian mob physically blocked Jews from entering a synagogue to celebrate Shavuot.

In Gaza, yesterday, Hamas fabricated a massacre — a total lie — and global media outlets rushed to amplify it without verifying facts. A modern blood libel, echoing through headlines.

And tonight, once again, a missile was fired toward Israel by the Houthis. Like millions of Israelis, I took my children and ran to the shelter. We waited for the interception. This is our new normal — even during holidays like Shavuot, meant to celebrate unity, morality, and the gift of Torah.

At the same time, 58 hostages — are still held in Gaza, and the world barely utters their names.

To all those injured and traumatized by these attacks — from Boulder, Paris, Brisbane, Israel, and DC — I send you strength, solidarity, and my heartfelt prayers for a full and speedy recovery.

None of these events stand alone. They are all part of a bigger, darker pattern: A Global obsession with Israel — and that obsession is fueling a dangerous, growing wave of antisemitism.

We are being targeted, vilified, and attacked — not for what we do, but for who we are. And today, this hatred is being carried forward under the banner of Hamas — a genocidal terrorist organization. Instead of being isolated and defeated, Hamas is being defended, excused, and even glorified by some — in protests, on social media, on university campuses, and in the streets.

We don’t celebrate Hamas. We fight it — because we know exactly what its ideology leads to: October 7, Boulder, Paris, Brisbane… and beyond.

I’m writing to you not just as the CEO of the Combat Antisemitism Movement, but as a Jew, as a father, as someone who can no longer stay quiet.

If you feel what I feel — if you see what I see — I ask you to act now:

Michael Masters, Secure Community Network CEO: “It’s time to realize America is being threatened by Hamas supporters operating inside our country. Their goal is to kill Jews, just as was done on October 7th in Israel, but it likely won’t stop with Jews. Americans, from the President, every member of Congress, and elected officials everywhere, to all our citizens, must do more to fight this threat. If Nazi sympathizers carried out two successful attacks inside our country, all of us would be rightfully incensed and demand stronger actions. Two attacks are enough. What makes anyone think there won’t be a third attack, including one on non-Jews? An attack on the Jewish community is an attack on religious freedom and our democracy. It’s time for more action.”

 StandWithUs condemns the heinous June 1 attack in Boulder Colorado of peaceful members of the Jewish and non-Jewish community who were walking – as they’ve done every week since the brutal Hamas attack on October 7, 2023 – to raise awareness about the 58 remaining hostages held in horrendous conditions by Hamas in Gaza. Jews are under assault throughout the world and we call on our elected officials and community leaders to condemn these attacks by misguided people who blame Israel for defending themselves against the crimes the terror organization Hamas committed. [Miri Kornfeld, Director of StandWithUs in Colorado, is one of the 4 co-leaders of Run For Their Lives in Denver.]

 Run For Their Lives: On June 1, 2025, our peaceful Run for Their Lives walk in Boulder, CO was brutally disrupted in a violent assault that Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is calling a hate crime. We are grateful to him and Colorado Governor Jared Polis for their immediate and decisive responses.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the eight burn victims from Sunday’s attack for a speedy recovery. We thank law enforcement and the fire department for their quick response and to the doctors and nurses working to heal.

Run for Their Lives is an apolitical global organization with the sole mission of walking peacefully to raise awareness for the 58 hostages still held in captivity by Hamas in Gaza. We are so thankful for our Run for Their Lives leaders and community members, who are all volunteers in our 230 groups worldwide.

This global grass roots organization was founded on October 15, 2023, a week after the horrendous terrorist attack by Hamas that left more than 1200 murdered, injured, raped and kidnapped. These walks have been held every week since then for all the hostages — without any violent incidents until Sunday.

The plight of the hostages is an international humanitarian crisis. The hostages, who hail from multiple countries, religions and ethnicities, have been held in the tunnels of Gaza without aid for more than 600 days. Reports indicate that at least 20 of them are still presumed to be alive, and we believe there is a collective responsibility to release them all.

We call on world leaders to do everything they can to ensure the swift return home of each of the 58 hostages. Run for Their Lives remains committed to our mission until ALL the HOSTAGES are returned back home!

Shameka Pruiett knew Soliman and his family as kindly neighbours with five children, three young kids and two teenagers, who'd play with Pruiett's kids in front of their building, share food and hellos. But she said when she saw Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognise him.

On Sunday, Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Soliman's home to come out. Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside, said Pruiett. The raid lasted several hours, she said.

Israel's war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250 others. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 people in Hamas-run Gaza, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas, displaced around 90 per cent of the population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.",

The man accused of carrying out the ""terrorist attack"" on a pro-Israel rally in Colorado had been planning the firebomb onslaught for a year, according to FBI officials.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested and charged with a hate crime offence after eight people were injured at the Run for Their Lives rally in Boulder, Colorado on Sunday.

Officials say the suspect shouted ""free Palestine"" and threw two lit Molotov cocktails at individuals participating in the gathering, which was supporting Israel in calling for the release of hostages being held by Hamas.

According to documents filed for the federal criminal case, officers found at least 14 unused Molotov cocktails in Soliman's possession when they arrested him.

In addition, police also found a backpack weed sprayer, found to contain octane gasoline, a red gas container and paperwork with the words, “Israel,” “Palestine,” and “USAID"".

An affidavit from FBI special agent Jessica Krueger said Soliman, who had ""overstayed his visa"" and was in the US illegally, arrived at the scene of the crime at 12.55pm and waited for the group.

He was charged following a police interview, in which the suspect claimed he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughters had graduated before carrying out the plan, the affidavit said.

He also told officers that Zionists were his targets and that he would conduct the attack again.

In the court filing seen by the BBC, Agent Kruger said: ""I seek a criminal complaint charging Mohammed Sabry SOLIMAN (“SOLIMAN”) with one count of a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.""

The charge comes after Donald Trump pinned the blame of the attack on Joe Biden's ""ridiculous border policy"".

Writing on his platform Truth Social, Mr Trump slammed Mr Biden for his ""ridiculous Open Border Policy"".

He said: ""Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America.

""Acts of terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders secure, and deport illegal, anti-American radicals from our homeland.""

The US president added that his ""heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the great people of Boulder, Colorado!""

Soliman is charged in the US District Court in Colorado with a hate crime pertaining to actual or perceived race, religion or national origin.

Eyewitnesses said the suspect lobbed Molotov cocktails, a homemade bomb constructed out of a bottle filled with petrol and stuffed with a piece of cloth to use as a fuse, into people attending the protest.

Eight people aged between 52 and 88 - including a Holocaust survivor - were injured in the attack.

The 88-year-old was injured along with her daughter, according to a community leader.

Elyana Funk, executive director of the University of Boulder Hillel, said the mother had been ""through enough trauma"".

Funk told CNN she had spoken to several victims of the attack - including one who had suffered ""horrible burns"".

No deaths have been reported.

Ms Funk said: “This wasn’t a pro-Israel rally or some sort of political statement on the war.

“These are peaceful people who’ve been walking for nearly 20 months weekly to bring awareness for the hostages.”

Soliman is also charged with one count of attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault, and one count of causing serious injury to an at-risk adult or someone over 70 and one count of using explosives or incendiary devices.

The FBI described the incident, which took place at Boulder Country Historic Courthouse, as a “targeted terror attack”.

Footage on social media shows a shirtless man holding bottles with cloth and clear liquid inside. Videos also show the man being detained at the scene.

Soliman is understood to be an Egyptian national who seemingly acted alone. Authorities said he has no previous significant contact with law enforcement.

Dan Bongino, a deputy director at the FBI, said: ""We are investigating this incident as an act of terror, and targeted violence.

Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called the incident ""pure anti-semitism"" on social media, adding that the attack is ""terrorism"" and demanding ""concrete action"".

He said: ""Jewish protesters were brutally attacked. Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border - it is already burning the streets of America.""

""From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,"" Colorado's Attorney General Phil Weiser said.

The group of people attacked were said to be peacefully demonstrating to show solidarity for Israeli hostages in Gaza, organised by a group called 'Run for Their Lives'.

Weiser continued: “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences.""

The suspect in the Boulder firebomb attack had reportedly worked at the Veros Health medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado.

He had also spent six months working at the independent physicians practice from early 2024 - sources told CBS News.

It's unclear what his role was at the clinic.

“We got the alert this morning and shared it with our board right away,” Temple President Teresa Freedman said. “We take every incident seriously—even when it’s hundreds of miles away.”

Temple Bet Yam is part of a network that includes a former FBI agent who monitors threats and distributes real-time alerts to synagogues across Northeast Florida.

“Every synagogue in Northeast Florida is looped in,” Freedman said. “We all get the same alerts, the same briefings—and we act fast when needed.”

Though she said recent bomb threats to local Jewish organizations haven’t resulted in violence, Freedman isn’t taking any chances. The temple is equipped with indoor and outdoor security cameras and holds events only when armed guards are present.

“We just held a drill during a community gathering to test our emergency plan,” Freedman said. “We may be small, but we’re not unprotected. We’ve done everything we can to keep our members safe.”

Temple officials say they will continue evaluating and adjusting security measures as national threats evolve.

“That's personal to me because my grandparents and mom are Holocaust survivors who came to America for safety and security as refugees,” Weiser told Colorado Matters host Ryan Warner on Monday. That's the promise of America – that promise was broken on Sunday in Boulder.”

Eight people were injured after a man threw incendiary devices at people participating in a walk and vigil for Israeli hostages being held by Hamas. Weiser said charges have been filed in Boulder County against the suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, but he added that special circumstances, including the age of some of the victims, could lead to enhanced charges.

“You could see both federal and state charges that could be involved here,” Weiser said. “The seriousness of this crime is obvious to anyone who's watched the pictures and I have every confidence the Boulder district attorney and the Department of Justice are taking this very seriously and will be able to hold the perpetrator accountable.”

At one point, Weiser compared Sunday’s violence to the 2021 shooting at a King Soopers store in Boulder that left 10 dead.

“This reminds me of conversations we had after (the shooting),” Weiser said. “Did people know anything about the perpetrator's plans and what, if anything, could have been done to prevent the attack? When people talk about their thoughts, their ideas about an attack like this, we got to take that seriously.

“We got to make sure we do all we can to prevent such tragedies.”

This interview has been edited for length and clarity

Ryan Warner: What are you certain of as we speak this morning? And what are your biggest questions?

Phil Weiser: What I am certain of is that law enforcement has apprehended this suspect who's engaged in what has every mark of a premeditated hate crime. As Tara described, this was a peaceful march of Jews from the Jewish community who were acting to call out the injustice and inhumane treatment of hostages still in Gaza, coming up this fall, two years after they were taken October 7, 2023. That means that the perpetrator knew who he was going after and he engaged in what has every mark of a hate crime, that he had planned to harm people, potentially even killing people. We're praying that no one is going to die. There's someone in critical condition that we've heard about. We've heard that one of the individuals is a Holocaust survivor. I also like Tara, know a number of the individuals who were there and it's a lot to take in.

In terms of questions, we're going to learn a lot more about the perpetrator and one of the questions that is always weighing heavily on us, this reminds me of conversations we had after the Boulder King Soopers shooting is did people know anything about perpetrators plans and what, if anything could have been done to prevent the attack? When people talk about their thoughts, their ideas about an attack like this, we've got to take that seriously, we've got to make sure we do all we can to prevent such tragedies.

Warner: Do you know yet what 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman of El Paso County, what he's been charged with specifically?

Weiser: The Boulder District Attorney has released a set of charges that are wide-ranging. Given the number of people affected, there are a number of possible charges, including not only potential enhancements for a hate crime, they're potential enhancements for going after those who are older Coloradans. We have another angle here, which the U.S. Attorney's Office has been investigating; you could see both federal and state charges that could be involved here. The seriousness of this crime is obvious to anyone who's watched the pictures and I have every confidence the Boulder District Attorney and the Department of Justice are taking this very seriously and will be able to hold the perpetrator accountable.

Warner: I just want to take a moment to highlight something you said a moment ago. One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor. That's something you've learned?

Weiser: Yes. Yes. It is a lot to behold because, as you noted, very aptly at the outset, anti-Semitic attacks, hate crimes based on one's religion, have been rising over the last several years. That's even before October 7. We've seen, as Tara Winer noted, an increase of anti-Semitism and what we really need is clarity that you can never justify hate, you can never justify politically motivated violence. The way we settle differences is through the democratic process, through dialogue. George Washington wrote a letter to Rhode Island Synagogue that talked about, ""America is a nation where bigotry has no sanction and everyone can sit safely under their own vine and fig tree.""

That's personal to me because my grandparents and mom are Holocaust survivors who came to America for safety and security as refugees, and that's the promise of America. That promise was broken on Sunday in Boulder. That's something that's shaken a lot of us. We've all got to commit to protecting one another and making clear that hate against any group needs to be treated as hate against all groups. This is how I felt after the Club Q attack. This is how we have to respond during these moments.

Warner: I have heard you use the term hate crime, the FBI saying terrorism. Can you parse those terms out for me? Are they relevant legally here?

Weiser: In Colorado, we have a punishment enhancement for when crimes are committed with what the law calls animus, which means you're attacking somebody based on who they are. So if you attack someone because of their race or ethnicity, their religion, their sexual orientation, that is something the law takes very seriously. Colorado doesn't have specific laws on terrorism. There are federal statutes that can address potential terrorist activities, and I think part of what you may be hearing, the difference between the federal and the state systems is as a matter of Colorado law, we have crimes that I think you're going to hear about here. Obviously attempted murder using a device like this, and I mentioned the issue about possible hate crimes. As a matter of federal law, terrorism tends to be viewed a little bit differently. I'm not clear whether that's going to come into play here or not.

Warner: There is a sentiment in Jewish circles that this was almost inevitable. It was only a matter of time before something like this happened or happened again, considering the killing of Israeli embassy employees in Washington last month. Just to read this statement from the Rose Community Foundation. ""For so many in our Jewish community, it has not been a question of if, but when. Today was sadly the day we hoped would never happen here or anywhere."" Does that resonate with you as a law enforcement officer? Does that resonate with you as a Jewish person?

Weiser: It does. The point that it brings home, when you hear about statistics, whether it's school shootings or anti-Semitic hate crimes, those statistics reflect a reality and those of us who were affected by the Boulder King Soopers shooting, it was different when it's your community. Some of the same people affected by that shooting are affected by this attack on the Pearl Street Mall. These are places that have felt safe to us as Jews, as Coloradans, as people who love Boulder, and now we have to struggle with this sense of vulnerability, this sense that we've come under attack because who we are, and that's something that is both known as anyone who looks at the statistics, but also now that we've experienced it takes on a whole other dimension and the hard work that we all have to do is not to let fear, not to let intimidation, not to let hate win.

That's something we, as all Coloradans, can do, and part of what's so important is the outpouring of support for the Jewish community from other groups who are doubling down on that proposition that we've got your back. We call out and condemn such actions. It's going to be hard for people who are on this march to continue. We all have to continue to be vigilant in this important work of standing up for what's right and what's right about America.”","While charges have been filed against the suspect, Weiser adds that enhancements for a hate crime may apply."

Trump took to Truth Social to share that the alleged perpetrator of the attack, 45-year-old illegal alien Mohamed Sabry Soliman, “must go out under ‘TRUMP’ policy,” and the Department of Justice will prosecute alleged perpetrators of terrorism to the law’s fullest extent:

Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America. He came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under “TRUMP” Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.

Trump emphasized the need for border security and sent well wishes to the six victims who were injured.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” he wrote.

Soliman allegedly shouted “Free Palestine” before purportedly launching his attack. His status in the country is illegal, as Breitbart News’s John Binder noted:

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials subsequently told Fox News’s Bill Melugin that Soliman arrived in the United States via LAX in Los Angeles, California, on a tourist visa in August 2022. The visa expired in February 2023, but Soliman never departed the U.S. as required by federal law, making him an illegal alien. Even after his visa had expired, former President Joe Biden’s administration approved a work permit for him to hold an American job in March 2023. That work permit expired in March of this year. DHS sources told CNN that Soliman had previously attempted to enter the U.S. 20 years ago but was denied a visa. It is still unclear why Biden’s DHS approved Soliman for a tourist visa following his prior denial of a visa.

It was a crime that top officials say the suspect should never have been able to commit.

Now booked in a Colorado jail, the Department of Homeland Security's Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said:

In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla. said, ""This man was in the country illegally. Had overstayed a visa. It was pretty telling. It should have been a red flag when he filed for asylum one month after receiving his temporary visa. But again, he overstayed his visa when it expired.”

In a post on Truth Social Monday, President Donald Trump said that the suspect ""came in through Biden’s ridiculous open border policy, which has hurt our country so badly. He must go out under “TRUMP” policy.

That ""Trump policy"" includes a recent crackdown by the Department of Justice on migrants who have not yet registered with the federal government online, a mandate stemming from a law passed in 1940 used in large part to target Japanese Americans.

The requirement was incorporated into an Executive Order signed by President Trump on his first day in office, which he titled ""PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST INVASION.""

The form is available online, and the deadline for registration passed in April.

""All aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a U.S. visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer.""

That Executive Order requires illegal immigrants 14 years and older to register with the federal government, providing fingerprints and a home address.

Those who fail to sign up could be charged with a misdemeanor and face $5,000 in fines and up to six months in prison.

In an interview with Sinclair Monday, Immigration Attorney Allen Orr said, ""This is largely shooting fish in a barrel for the Trump administration.""

He said, ""They’re asking people to register and they're removing the people who are registering. Once again, it is law-abiding immigrants who have challenges with their documentation who are in the system, who are going to follow the law and for following the law, those individuals are gonna be removed.""

Orr argued that the registry requirement sends the same message as recent arrests at courthouses for immigrants showing up for their immigration hearings.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, targeted what he described as a ""Zionist group"" gathering in a popular pedestrian mall in the city of Boulder on Sunday, local time, the court papers say.

Witnesses and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) first said Mr Soliman yelled ""Free Palestine"" and used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices during the attack, injuring at least eight people.

The district attorney for Boulder County, Michael Dougherty, told reporters on Monday that four more victims had been identified since the alleged attack, bringing the total to 12.

Mr Dougherty also said Mr Soliman faced a total of 34 charges, including attempted murder and the use of an incendiary device. If convicted concurrently of all charges, Mr Soliman would be jailed in a Colorado prison for 624 years.

A judge in Boulder on Monday set Mr Soliman's cash-only bail at $US10 million ($15.3 million), Mr Dougherty said.

An FBI affidavit revealed earlier that police found at least 14 more unlit Molotov cocktails and a weed sprayer filled with gasoline at the scene, as well as another gasoline canister in his car parked nearby.

The acting US attorney for Colorado, J Bishop Grewell, told reporters that authorities believed Mr Soliman had previously tried to buy a firearm to use in the alleged terror attack but was unable to because of his visa status in the country.

Court documents also revealed that Mr Soliman had learned to shoot a gun in a class he took for the purpose of obtaining a concealed-carry permit, and delayed committing the alleged terror attack until after his daughter had graduated from high school.

The alleged terror attack has since drawn the condemnation of US President Donald Trump, who described the incident as ""horrific"".

""He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under 'TRUMP' Policy.

""Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

The FBI affidavit says Mr Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody, said that he ""wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead"", and told the police he would do it again.

The Molotov cocktails were made up of glass wine carafe bottles or jars with clear liquid and red rags hanging out of them, the FBI said.

Inside Mr Soliman's car, law enforcement found papers with the words ""Israel"", ""Palestine"" and ""USAID"", according to the FBI affidavit.

Mr Soliman told investigators he constructed homemade Molotov cocktails after doing research on YouTube and buying the ingredients.

""This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts,"" FBI deputy director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

The FBI said it believed Mr Soliman acted alone, and was also injured in the attack before he was taken to hospital.

FBI Denver special agent Mark Michaelek told reporters on Monday that his team was continuing to work to determine if Mr Soliman committed the attack with the help of anyone else.

""If we uncover evidence that others knew of this attack or supported the subject in this attack, rest assured that we will aggressively move to hold them accountable to the full extent of the law,"" Mr Michaelek said.

Authorities did not elaborate on the nature of Mr Soliman's injuries, but an image taken of him while in custody showed him with a large bandage over one ear.

Mr Michaelek said the FBI has interviewed at least 44 witnesses and undertaken search warrants of vehicles, a home related to Mr Soliman in Colorado Springs and digital devices.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street mall unfolded against the backdrop of a war between Israel and Hamas that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States.

The attack happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled ""Free Palestine"" was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

US Attorney-General Pam Bondi said in a statement that Mr Soliman will be prosecuted ""to the fullest extent of the law"".

""We will never tolerate this kind of hatred,"" she said.

What is known about the alleged Colorado attacker?

Mr Soliman was living in the US illegally after entering the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X.

Ms McLaughlin said Mr Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorisation in March 2023 that had expired.

Todd Lyons, the acting director of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Mr Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit.

Federal documents make no reference to his nationality but the New York Times said he was Egyptian, citing the Department of Homeland Security.

Public records listed Mr Soliman as living in a rented townhouse in Colorado Springs, about 61 kilometres south of Boulder, where local media outlets reported federal law enforcement agents were on the scene on Sunday.

A police affidavit filed in support of Mr Soliman's arrest warrant said he was born in Egypt, lived in Kuwait for 17 years and moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, where he lived with his wife and five children.

Shameka Pruiett knew Mr Soliman and his family as kind neighbours who would play with her children in front of their building, share food and offer hellos.

Ms Pruiett said when she saw Mr Soliman on video in Boulder, shirtless and holding bottles with flames licking up the grass in front of him, it was hard to recognise him.

Another neighbour, Kierra Johnson, who lives in the apartment next to Mr Soliman's, said she could often hear shouting at night from his apartment and once called police because of the screaming and yelling.

On Sunday, Ms Pruiett saw law enforcement vehicles waiting on the street throughout the day until the evening, when they spoke through a megaphone telling anyone in Mr Soliman's home to come out.

Nobody came out and it did not appear anyone was inside during the hours-long raid, Ms Pruiett said.

An online resume under Mr Soliman's name said he was employed by a Denver-area healthcare company working in accounting and inventory control, with prior employers listed as companies in Egypt.

Under education, the resume listed Al-Azhar University, a historic centre for Islamic and Arabic learning located in Cairo.

Mr Soliman also worked as an Uber driver and had passed the company's eligibility requirements, which include a criminal background check, according to a spokesperson for Uber.

The company has since banned Mr Soliman's account and has been in touch with law enforcement.

What is known about the victims of the Colorado attack?

The eight victims who were injured in the attack range in age from 52 to 88 and their injuries spanned from serious to minor, according to officials.

Six of the injured were taken to hospitals, and four have since been released, said Miri Kornfeld, a Denver-based organiser connected to the group.

Ms Kornfield said the clothing of one of those who remains hospitalised caught on fire during the incident.

""The status of that victim is improving, but still not out of the woods,"" she said.

The attack occurred as people with a volunteer group called Run For Their Lives were concluding their weekly demonstration to raise visibility for the hostages who remain in Gaza.

Video from the scene shows a witness shouting: ""He's right there. He's throwing Molotov cocktails,"" as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on a bare-chested suspect who is holding containers in each hand.

Alex Osante from San Diego, California said he was having lunch on a restaurant patio across the pedestrian mall when he heard the crash of a bottle breaking on the ground and a ""boom"" followed by people yelling and screaming.

In a video of the scene captured by Mr Osante, people could be seen pouring water on a woman lying on the ground who Mr Osante said had caught on fire during the attack.

After the initial attack, Mr Osante said the suspect went behind some bushes and then re-emerged and threw a Molotov cocktail but apparently accidentally caught himself on fire as he threw it.

Mr Soliman then took off his shirt and what appeared to be a bulletproof vest before the police arrived, he dropped to the ground and was arrested without any apparent resistance in the video filmed by Mr Osante.

Photos from the scene also showed a burning woman lying on the ground in a fetal position and a man helping to put out the flames using a jug of water.",FBI documents allege Mohamed Sabry Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails at a pro-Israel group in an attack he says he planned for more than a year.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity

Ryan Warner: What are you certain of as we speak this morning? And what are your biggest questions?

Phil Weiser: What I am certain of is that law enforcement has apprehended this suspect who's engaged in what has every mark of a premeditated hate crime. As Tara described, this was a peaceful march of Jews from the Jewish community who were acting to call out the injustice and inhumane treatment of hostages still in Gaza, coming up this fall, two years after they were taken October 7, 2023. That means that the perpetrator knew who he was going after and he engaged in what has every mark of a hate crime, that he had planned to harm people, potentially even killing people. We're praying that no one is going to die. There's someone in critical condition that we've heard about. We've heard that one of the individuals is a Holocaust survivor. I also like Tara, know a number of the individuals who were there and it's a lot to take in.

In terms of questions, we're going to learn a lot more about the perpetrator and one of the questions that is always weighing heavily on us, this reminds me of conversations we had after the Boulder King Soopers shooting is did people know anything about perpetrators plans and what, if anything could have been done to prevent the attack? When people talk about their thoughts, their ideas about an attack like this, we've got to take that seriously, we've got to make sure we do all we can to prevent such tragedies.

Warner: Do you know yet what 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman of El Paso County, what he's been charged with specifically?

Weiser: The Boulder District Attorney has released a set of charges that are wide-ranging. Given the number of people affected, there are a number of possible charges, including not only potential enhancements for a hate crime, they're potential enhancements for going after those who are older Coloradans. We have another angle here, which the U.S. Attorney's Office has been investigating; you could see both federal and state charges that could be involved here. The seriousness of this crime is obvious to anyone who's watched the pictures and I have every confidence the Boulder District Attorney and the Department of Justice are taking this very seriously and will be able to hold the perpetrator accountable.

Warner: I just want to take a moment to highlight something you said a moment ago. One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor. That's something you've learned?

Weiser: Yes. Yes. It is a lot to behold because, as you noted, very aptly at the outset, anti-Semitic attacks, hate crimes based on one's religion, have been rising over the last several years. That's even before October 7. We've seen, as Tara Winer noted, an increase of anti-Semitism and what we really need is clarity that you can never justify hate, you can never justify politically motivated violence. The way we settle differences is through the democratic process, through dialogue. George Washington wrote a letter to Rhode Island Synagogue that talked about, ""America is a nation where bigotry has no sanction and everyone can sit safely under their own vine and fig tree.""

That's personal to me because my grandparents and mom are Holocaust survivors who came to America for safety and security as refugees, and that's the promise of America. That promise was broken on Sunday in Boulder. That's something that's shaken a lot of us. We've all got to commit to protecting one another and making clear that hate against any group needs to be treated as hate against all groups. This is how I felt after the Club Q attack. This is how we have to respond during these moments.

Warner: I have heard you use the term hate crime, the FBI saying terrorism. Can you parse those terms out for me? Are they relevant legally here?

Weiser: In Colorado, we have a punishment enhancement for when crimes are committed with what the law calls animus, which means you're attacking somebody based on who they are. So if you attack someone because of their race or ethnicity, their religion, their sexual orientation, that is something the law takes very seriously. Colorado doesn't have specific laws on terrorism. There are federal statutes that can address potential terrorist activities, and I think part of what you may be hearing, the difference between the federal and the state systems is as a matter of Colorado law, we have crimes that I think you're going to hear about here. Obviously attempted murder using a device like this, and I mentioned the issue about possible hate crimes. As a matter of federal law, terrorism tends to be viewed a little bit differently. I'm not clear whether that's going to come into play here or not.

Warner: There is a sentiment in Jewish circles that this was almost inevitable. It was only a matter of time before something like this happened or happened again, considering the killing of Israeli embassy employees in Washington last month. Just to read this statement from the Rose Community Foundation. ""For so many in our Jewish community, it has not been a question of if, but when. Today was sadly the day we hoped would never happen here or anywhere."" Does that resonate with you as a law enforcement officer? Does that resonate with you as a Jewish person?

Weiser: It does. The point that it brings home, when you hear about statistics, whether it's school shootings or anti-Semitic hate crimes, those statistics reflect a reality and those of us who were affected by the Boulder King Soopers shooting, it was different when it's your community. Some of the same people affected by that shooting are affected by this attack on the Pearl Street Mall. These are places that have felt safe to us as Jews, as Coloradans, as people who love Boulder, and now we have to struggle with this sense of vulnerability, this sense that we've come under attack because who we are, and that's something that is both known as anyone who looks at the statistics, but also now that we've experienced it takes on a whole other dimension and the hard work that we all have to do is not to let fear, not to let intimidation, not to let hate win.

That's something we, as all Coloradans, can do, and part of what's so important is the outpouring of support for the Jewish community from other groups who are doubling down on that proposition that we've got your back. We call out and condemn such actions. It's going to be hard for people who are on this march to continue. We all have to continue to be vigilant in this important work of standing up for what's right and what's right about America.”","While charges have been filed against the suspect, Weiser adds that enhancements for a hate crime may apply."

Trump took to Truth Social to share that the alleged perpetrator of the attack, 45-year-old illegal alien Mohamed Sabry Soliman, “must go out under ‘TRUMP’ policy,” and the Department of Justice will prosecute alleged perpetrators of terrorism to the law’s fullest extent:

Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America. He came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under “TRUMP” Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.

Trump emphasized the need for border security and sent well wishes to the six victims who were injured.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” he wrote.

Soliman allegedly shouted “Free Palestine” before purportedly launching his attack. His status in the country is illegal, as Breitbart News’s John Binder noted:

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials subsequently told Fox News’s Bill Melugin that Soliman arrived in the United States via LAX in Los Angeles, California, on a tourist visa in August 2022. The visa expired in February 2023, but Soliman never departed the U.S. as required by federal law, making him an illegal alien. Even after his visa had expired, former President Joe Biden’s administration approved a work permit for him to hold an American job in March 2023. That work permit expired in March of this year. DHS sources told CNN that Soliman had previously attempted to enter the U.S. 20 years ago but was denied a visa. It is still unclear why Biden’s DHS approved Soliman for a tourist visa following his prior denial of a visa.

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee weighed in on the attack Monday as well, slamming some of America’s biggest news outlets for “reckless and irresponsible” coverage that he says perpetuates antisemitism.",President Donald Trump said Monday that terrorism will not be tolerated after the attack on Jewish Americans and Israel supporters in Colorado.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!” he wrote.

Soliman allegedly shouted “Free Palestine” before purportedly launching his attack. His status in the country is illegal, as Breitbart News’s John Binder noted:

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials subsequently told Fox News’s Bill Melugin that Soliman arrived in the United States via LAX in Los Angeles, California, on a tourist visa in August 2022. The visa expired in February 2023, but Soliman never departed the U.S. as required by federal law, making him an illegal alien. Even after his visa had expired, former President Joe Biden’s administration approved a work permit for him to hold an American job in March 2023. That work permit expired in March of this year. DHS sources told CNN that Soliman had previously attempted to enter the U.S. 20 years ago but was denied a visa. It is still unclear why Biden’s DHS approved Soliman for a tourist visa following his prior denial of a visa.

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee weighed in on the attack Monday as well, slamming some of America’s biggest news outlets for “reckless and irresponsible” coverage that he says perpetuates antisemitism.",President Donald Trump said Monday that terrorism will not be tolerated after the attack on Jewish Americans and Israel supporters in Colorado.

“That's personal to me because my grandparents and mom are Holocaust survivors who came to America for safety and security as refugees,” Weiser told Colorado Matters host Ryan Warner on Monday. That's the promise of America – that promise was broken on Sunday in Boulder.”

Eight people were injured after a man threw incendiary devices at people participating in a walk and vigil for Israeli hostages being held by Hamas. Weiser said charges have been filed in Boulder County against the suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, but he added that special circumstances, including the age of some of the victims, could lead to enhanced charges.

“You could see both federal and state charges that could be involved here,” Weiser said. “The seriousness of this crime is obvious to anyone who's watched the pictures and I have every confidence the Boulder district attorney and the Department of Justice are taking this very seriously and will be able to hold the perpetrator accountable.”

At one point, Weiser compared Sunday’s violence to the 2021 shooting at a King Soopers store in Boulder that left 10 dead.

“This reminds me of conversations we had after (the shooting),” Weiser said. “Did people know anything about the perpetrator's plans and what, if anything, could have been done to prevent the attack? When people talk about their thoughts, their ideas about an attack like this, we got to take that seriously.

“We got to make sure we do all we can to prevent such tragedies.”

This interview has been edited for length and clarity

Ryan Warner: What are you certain of as we speak this morning? And what are your biggest questions?

Phil Weiser: What I am certain of is that law enforcement has apprehended this suspect who's engaged in what has every mark of a premeditated hate crime. As Tara described, this was a peaceful march of Jews from the Jewish community who were acting to call out the injustice and inhumane treatment of hostages still in Gaza, coming up this fall, two years after they were taken October 7, 2023. That means that the perpetrator knew who he was going after and he engaged in what has every mark of a hate crime, that he had planned to harm people, potentially even killing people. We're praying that no one is going to die. There's someone in critical condition that we've heard about. We've heard that one of the individuals is a Holocaust survivor. I also like Tara, know a number of the individuals who were there and it's a lot to take in.

In terms of questions, we're going to learn a lot more about the perpetrator and one of the questions that is always weighing heavily on us, this reminds me of conversations we had after the Boulder King Soopers shooting is did people know anything about perpetrators plans and what, if anything could have been done to prevent the attack? When people talk about their thoughts, their ideas about an attack like this, we've got to take that seriously, we've got to make sure we do all we can to prevent such tragedies.

Warner: Do you know yet what 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman of El Paso County, what he's been charged with specifically?

Weiser: The Boulder District Attorney has released a set of charges that are wide-ranging. Given the number of people affected, there are a number of possible charges, including not only potential enhancements for a hate crime, they're potential enhancements for going after those who are older Coloradans. We have another angle here, which the U.S. Attorney's Office has been investigating; you could see both federal and state charges that could be involved here. The seriousness of this crime is obvious to anyone who's watched the pictures and I have every confidence the Boulder District Attorney and the Department of Justice are taking this very seriously and will be able to hold the perpetrator accountable.

Warner: I just want to take a moment to highlight something you said a moment ago. One of the victims is a Holocaust survivor. That's something you've learned?

Weiser: Yes. Yes. It is a lot to behold because, as you noted, very aptly at the outset, anti-Semitic attacks, hate crimes based on one's religion, have been rising over the last several years. That's even before October 7. We've seen, as Tara Winer noted, an increase of anti-Semitism and what we really need is clarity that you can never justify hate, you can never justify politically motivated violence. The way we settle differences is through the democratic process, through dialogue. George Washington wrote a letter to Rhode Island Synagogue that talked about, ""America is a nation where bigotry has no sanction and everyone can sit safely under their own vine and fig tree.""

That's personal to me because my grandparents and mom are Holocaust survivors who came to America for safety and security as refugees, and that's the promise of America. That promise was broken on Sunday in Boulder. That's something that's shaken a lot of us. We've all got to commit to protecting one another and making clear that hate against any group needs to be treated as hate against all groups. This is how I felt after the Club Q attack. This is how we have to respond during these moments.

Warner: I have heard you use the term hate crime, the FBI saying terrorism. Can you parse those terms out for me? Are they relevant legally here?

Weiser: In Colorado, we have a punishment enhancement for when crimes are committed with what the law calls animus, which means you're attacking somebody based on who they are. So if you attack someone because of their race or ethnicity, their religion, their sexual orientation, that is something the law takes very seriously. Colorado doesn't have specific laws on terrorism. There are federal statutes that can address potential terrorist activities, and I think part of what you may be hearing, the difference between the federal and the state systems is as a matter of Colorado law, we have crimes that I think you're going to hear about here. Obviously attempted murder using a device like this, and I mentioned the issue about possible hate crimes. As a matter of federal law, terrorism tends to be viewed a little bit differently. I'm not clear whether that's going to come into play here or not.

Warner: There is a sentiment in Jewish circles that this was almost inevitable. It was only a matter of time before something like this happened or happened again, considering the killing of Israeli embassy employees in Washington last month. Just to read this statement from the Rose Community Foundation. ""For so many in our Jewish community, it has not been a question of if, but when. Today was sadly the day we hoped would never happen here or anywhere."" Does that resonate with you as a law enforcement officer? Does that resonate with you as a Jewish person?

Weiser: It does. The point that it brings home, when you hear about statistics, whether it's school shootings or anti-Semitic hate crimes, those statistics reflect a reality and those of us who were affected by the Boulder King Soopers shooting, it was different when it's your community. Some of the same people affected by that shooting are affected by this attack on the Pearl Street Mall. These are places that have felt safe to us as Jews, as Coloradans, as people who love Boulder, and now we have to struggle with this sense of vulnerability, this sense that we've come under attack because who we are, and that's something that is both known as anyone who looks at the statistics, but also now that we've experienced it takes on a whole other dimension and the hard work that we all have to do is not to let fear, not to let intimidation, not to let hate win.

That's something we, as all Coloradans, can do, and part of what's so important is the outpouring of support for the Jewish community from other groups who are doubling down on that proposition that we've got your back. We call out and condemn such actions. It's going to be hard for people who are on this march to continue. We all have to continue to be vigilant in this important work of standing up for what's right and what's right about America.”","While charges have been filed against the suspect, Weiser adds that enhancements for a hate crime may apply."

""The Supreme Court has said the First Amendment protects not just your right to say something, but also your right not to be compelled to say something you don't want to say,"" said Sarah Parshall Perry, senior legal fellow with Defending Education.

Following widespread pushback, lawmakers removed a section of the bill that would have treated ""misgendering"" as coercive control in child custody cases. Plaintiffs are now seeking an injunction, which could make this Colorado's third case to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

""The hubris of the state of Colorado to believe that it can put its thumb on the scale of free speech is really an exercise in the kind of narcissism that we're seeing out of these blue states,"" Perry said. ""In particular, Colorado is a historic bad actor when it comes to anti-discrimination law. It has the tendency to target objectors to progressive ideologies.""

Perry also suggested the case could set a national legal benchmark.

""I am hopeful that if the Supreme Court does eventually get a chance to weigh in on this case, that they will clarify that the state of Colorado has expressed religious animus,"" she said.

Governor Polis, the nation's first openly gay governor, said he was ""not comfortable"" with earlier drafts of the bill but praised the final version, calling it a fair compromise.

Illegal immigration reenters spotlight after Boulder attack,"45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman has now been charged with a hate crime for the attack on a Jewish community event in Boulder, Colorado, on Sunday. It was a crime that top officials say the suspect should never have been able to commit.

Now booked in a Colorado jail, the Department of Homeland Security's Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said:

In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla. said, ""This man was in the country illegally. Had overstayed a visa. It was pretty telling. It should have been a red flag when he filed for asylum one month after receiving his temporary visa. But again, he overstayed his visa when it expired.”

In a post on Truth Social Monday, President Donald Trump said that the suspect ""came in through Biden’s ridiculous open border policy, which has hurt our country so badly. He must go out under “TRUMP” policy.

That ""Trump policy"" includes a recent crackdown by the Department of Justice on migrants who have not yet registered with the federal government online, a mandate stemming from a law passed in 1940 used in large part to target Japanese Americans.

The requirement was incorporated into an Executive Order signed by President Trump on his first day in office, which he titled ""PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAINST INVASION.""

The form is available online, and the deadline for registration passed in April.

""All aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a U.S. visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer.""

That Executive Order requires illegal immigrants 14 years and older to register with the federal government, providing fingerprints and a home address.

Those who fail to sign up could be charged with a misdemeanor and face $5,000 in fines and up to six months in prison.

In an interview with Sinclair Monday, Immigration Attorney Allen Orr said, ""This is largely shooting fish in a barrel for the Trump administration.""

He said, ""They’re asking people to register and they're removing the people who are registering. Once again, it is law-abiding immigrants who have challenges with their documentation who are in the system, who are going to follow the law and for following the law, those individuals are gonna be removed.""

Orr argued that the registry requirement sends the same message as recent arrests at courthouses for immigrants showing up for their immigration hearings.

That message? Following the rules could get you deported.",It was a crime that top officials say the suspect should never have been able to commit.

Omar and Tlaib Are Branded ‘Muslim Terrorists’ by Fellow Lawmaker","The morning after an attack on a group of people in Colorado demonstrating in support of freeing the hostages held in Gaza, Democrat Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, both of whom are Muslims, had yet to issue statements condemning the violence.

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., who is Jewish, was critical of the silence from the two Muslim congresswomen following the attack Sunday that left eight people injured in Boulder, Colorado.

“They’re Muslim terrorists,” he said when asked what he made of their lack of a public statement as of Monday morning.

“I put it to people this way,” Fine continued, “the people who are sitting, running Hamas in Qatar, they’re not blowing anything up, but they support terrorism. If you support Muslim terrorism, you’re a Muslim terrorist, and I believe that they both do. You can see it in the silence. I think it is a disgrace that they are Americans, let alone in Congress. And I believe that the way you fight for good is to call out evil.”

Tlaib and Omar did respond to the attack on Monday afternoon after The Daily Signal’s conversation with Fine.

“The violent attack in Boulder is horrific,” Tlaib wrote on X. “My heart goes out to all of the victims and their families. Violence has no place in our communities.”

“I’m holding the victims and families in Boulder, Colorado, in my heart,” Omar wrote on X just after Tlaib issued her statement. “Violence against anyone is never acceptable. We must reject hatred and harm in all its forms.”

Neither Tlaib nor Omar answered The Daily Signal’s request for comment in response to Fine’s claim that the congresswomen are in essence “Muslim terrorists.”

Mohamed Soliman, charged with a federal hate crime and facing state charges of attempted murder, used a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary device as he shouted, “Free Palestine,” and attacked the group of people marching in support of freeing the Israeli hostages seized in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. 



Soliman, an Egyptian national in the country illegally, is in custody.

Fine has spent years speaking out in support of the Jewish community and says he will continue to do so as a new member of Congress. Before being elected to Congress on April 1 in a special election, Fine served in the Florida Legislature, where he spearheaded the passage of legislation to combat antisemitism at universities in the state.

Fine has now introduced similar legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives that is aimed at stopping antisemitic harassment on college campuses.

The antisemitism that has arisen in America “comes directly from our universities,” Fine said.

There is a lot of fear among the Jewish community in America following Sunday’s attack and the fatal shootings in Washington, D.C., on May 21 that left two Israeli Embassy staff members dead. In both instances, Fine says the suspects went “hunting” for Jewish people to harm.

“I mean, people are afraid because there’s not enough security to solve for this problem. And what we’ve seen is, we’ve seen it tolerated,” he said.

Today, Fine added, “we have reached a world where … the Left has told us, ‘globalize the intifada,’ [and] their soldiers are listening.” Still, the congressman said, he has hope because the policy steps taken in Florida have been effective.

“When you show that you’re not afraid, when you call evil for what it is, when you don’t back down, they back off,” he said.

The charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the suspect is being held on dozens of state charges, including multiple counts of attempted murder, use of an incendiary device, and attempted use of an incendiary device. He is being held on $10 million cash-only bond on those charges, Dougherty said.

Miri Kornfeld, an organizer with the group that was attacked, said they hold weekly walks to raise awareness of Israeli hostages. She said they were walking on Pearl Street on Sunday afternoon and that the man was waiting for them when they arrived at the courthouse.

Soliman was pointed out by witnesses and detained at the scene. According to federal court documents, a black plastic container with a yellow top was found near him. In the black plastic container were unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or jars that contained clear liquid. Each one had red rags hanging out of them.

Soliman, who lives in Colorado Springs with his wife and five children, said he drove to Boulder and threw two of them at the people who were participating in the march. He said he ""wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,"" the federal complaint says, and went on to say he would do it again.

Throughout the interview with investigators, Soliman said he ""hated"" the Zionist group and carried out the attack because he needed to stop them from taking over ""our land,"" which he explained to be Palestine, the complaint says.

Federal prosecutors said there is probable cause to believe that he targeted the demonstrators because they were calling for the release of Israeli hostages being held by the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The FBI says the man charged in the attack in Boulder, Colorado, that left eight people injured told police he planned it for a year and specifically targeted what he described as the “Zionist group.” An FBI affidavit says Mohammed Soliman confessed to the attack after being taken into custody Sunday and told the police he would do it again. The affidavit was released in support of a federal hate crime charge filed by the Justice Department on Monday.

Soliman, an Egyptian national, allegedly firebombed the pro-Israel demonstration using Molotov cocktails. He is also facing felony charges including murder in the first degree, first degree assault, use of explosives or incendiary devices during a felony, and several others.

It was later revealed that Soliman was residing in the country illegally, having overstayed his visa after immigrating in 2022.

The Boulder, Colorado, terror suspect, Mohamed Soliman, who allegedly threw Molotov cocktails at pro-Israel demonstrators on Sunday, is reportedly an Egyptian national who was in the United States illegally. According to reports, Soliman entered the country under the Biden administration on a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa, arriving in Los Angeles on August 27, 2022. His visa authorized him to stay through February 26, 2023, but he overstayed and never left. He was later granted an extension for ""work"" through early 2024, but remained in the country beyond that period. According to Fox News’s Bill Melugin, three senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials said Soliman filed a claim—possibly for asylum—with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on September 29, 2022. On March 29, 2023, USCIS under the Biden administration granted him work authorization, which expired on March 28, 2024.

In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said these types of attacks “WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America.” He affirmed that “Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.”",

Jared Polis said in a statement. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror.""

“I am horrified by the heinous act of terror that took place in downtown Boulder this afternoon, and my wife Andrea and I are praying for the victims,"" Neguse said. ""Tonight, as many prepare to mark the Shavuot holiday, our Jewish community has been subjected to yet another brutal and horrific act of violence. The scourge of antisemitism has metastasized across our country, and we must do more — now — to stop this hatred and violence. We stand with the Jewish community — today and always — and will be united in supporting the victims and their families, and to redoubling our efforts to stop antisemitism.”",The suspect told investigators he researched how to make Molotov cocktails and targeted the group in Boulder after finding out about them online.

(WGGB/WSHM) - Western Mass News spoke with a local Holocaust survivor about the recent antisemitic attack in Colorado. She let us know that when something like this happens, it brings back a flood of memories, especially when a fellow survivor is involved.

“It’s just so traumatic my personal history of what antisemitism can lead to.” Said Henny Lewin.

Henny Lewin lives in western Massachusetts now, but in 1941 she was just a little girl when Nazis invaded her home of Lithuania and suddenly she and her entire family found themselves in what was called a ghetto, crammed into buildings with several other Jewish families. She was later smuggled out to live with a non-Jewish family.

“And of course we keep saying to ourselves it can’t happen again, it can’t happen here not in America.” Said Lewin.

But with a string of antisemitic attacks across the country including this week’s incident in Boulder Colorado where 8 Jewish people were targeted and injured including an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor. Lewin told us it brings back all the fear she felt all those years ago.

“When something like this happens it’s a rush of memory that comes to me and helplessness, like what can I do about this.”

And as a Holocaust survivor herself, Lewin has a unique understanding of what the victims are going through.

“I haven’t been able to relax you know, I try to sleep, I woke up several times. All that was going through my head is that one of the people must be a Holocaust survivor I mean I didn’t know it, but it’s said from age 52 to 88 and the 88 jumped out at me, and of course today I found out that actually it is a Holocaust survivor.”

Lewin added that she finds herself using extra precautions recently due to events like the tragedy in Colorado happening more and more frequently. She added that any kind of Jewish event she attends nowadays is accompanied by a police presence.

“Some people won’t even go to these events. I have Zoomed in quite a bit instead of attending in person. You know, I wear a Jewish star and instead of wearing it outside on top of my clothes, I wear it inside. You know, I mean that’s terrible that I’m worried that somebody, some crazy, might attack me.” Said Lewin

In the wake of recent attacks in Washington D.C., as well as the most recent tragedy out of Colorado, Adam Soleder said that synagogues and Jewish community members across the country are forced to add extra precautions. Solder, the interim CEO of the Jewish Federation of Western Mass, shared his reaction to this week’s attack in Colorado with us:

“In many ways this feels this was inevitable with the rhetoric we see going on out there.

Deputy Mayor Lindsey Appiah gave the following statement to 7News: “Mayor Bowser often emphasizes that public safety is a shared responsibility between government and the community. Through the Safe and Secure DC Grant, we’re proud to strengthen that partnership by supporting nonprofit organizations with funding for equipment, staffing, and training resources that enhance their ability to safeguard both their teams and the residents and visitors they serve.”

""You cannot guarantee security, all you can do is reduce the likelihood for someone who wants to cause harm, someone who wants to hurt people, to reduce the likelihood they’d do it,"" said Gil Preuss, president of the federation.

Preuss goes to Congregation Adas Israel in Cleveland Park and said he goes through metal detectors. However, not every synagogue has them.

""The situation has also gotten more complicated if we look at attack on Jewish museum, they were on sidewalk leaving an event, if we look at attack in Boulder, they were outside in a public space,"" Preuss said.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene, after he allegedly set his victims on fire as they peacefully rallied on behalf of Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza. Soliman was heard yelling “Free Palestine” and other anti-Israel slogans during the attack on victims ranging in age from 67 to 88.

The shocking violence unfolded at 1:26 p.m. local time, when Boulder police were called to the county courthouse on Pearl Street for reports of a man, who had a weapon and was setting people on fire, according to Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn. The attack took place near an event put on by “Run for Their Lives,” a grassroots group that organizes run and walk events calling for the release of Israeli hostages held since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).

The suspect was heard yelling, “How many children you killed?” and “We have to end Zionists, they are killers,” according to an analysis of video of the scene by the ADL Center on Extremism.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said the attack, which happened on the eve of Shavuot, appears to have been motivated by hate.

“From what we know, this attack appears to be a hate crime given the group that was targeted,” Weiser wrote in a statement. “People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said the attack is being investigated as an act of “ideologically motivated violence,” based on early information, evidence and witness accounts. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed the National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground.

Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sources told Fox News Soliman is in the country illegally as a visa over-stay, who came in during the Biden administration.

He allegedly flew into the U.S. on Aug. 27, 2022, arriving at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa. Soliman was authorized to stay through Feb. 26, 2023, but never left, according to officials. On Sept. 29, 2022, he filed a claim, possibly for asylum.

On March 29, 2023, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), under the Biden administration, gave him work authorization, which was valid through March of this year.

Police initially evacuated three surrounding blocks and later expanded the evacuation area.",The Biden administration allowed in Mohamed Sabry Soliman.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was already facing an array of state charges, including attempted murder, after the attack on Sunday in the city of Boulder on a group seeking to draw attention to hostages seized in Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an “antisemitic terror attack”.

The affidavit said Soliman, 45, had planned the attack for more than a year. Investigators found 14 Molotov cocktails filled with petrol or gasoline near where the suspect was detained.

The police also found a petrol canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with petrol at the scene. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the firebombs from YouTube.

The affidavit references a video posted on social media during the attack showing Soliman “shirtless, pacing back and forth while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails”.

The suspect, who was being detained in lieu of $10m bail, according to official records, told police he “wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead”, the affidavit said.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of Israel’s war on Gaza that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in anti-Semitic violence in the United States.

The attack happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

According to the complaint, Soliman lived with his wife and five children in Colorado Springs, a city about 161km (100 miles) south of Boulder. The affidavit says that he waited until after his daughter’s graduation to conduct the attack.

Few other details were available about him.

Todd Lyons, acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit.

Federal documents make no reference to his nationality, but the New York Times said he was Egyptian, citing the Department of Homeland Security.

The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice did not respond to requests for comment. The Denver office of the FBI, which is handling the case, did not immediately respond to emails or phone calls seeking details in the case.

Officials from the Boulder County Jail, Boulder Police and Boulder County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to inquiries.

“There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren’t properly screened that were allowed in,” Lyons said during a press conference in Boston. “I will tell you that’s a huge effort for ICE right now.”

Under former US President Joe Biden, ICE prioritised arrests of serious criminals and called for officers to consider humanitarian factors when making arrests.

Lyons declined to provide more information, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously said Soliman had entered the country in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month. “The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” the spokesperson said.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a “terrible tragedy”.

He blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” he wrote.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years of age were transported to hospitals after the attack, Boulder police said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado, during an event organised by Run for Their Lives, a group devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told CBS Colorado that the 88-year-old victim was a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

Sunday’s attack was not the first high-profile incident of mass violence in Boulder, a university town that attracts many young professionals and outdoor enthusiasts. In 2021, a gunman fatally shot 10 people, including an off-duty police officer, in a local supermarket.",

Witnesses said the suspect threw Molotov cocktails that burned multiple victims, police and the FBI said. Boulder police initially said five people, then eight were injured; they raised the total to 12 on Monday afternoon and then 15 on Wednesday after officials said more people with less serious injuries came forward.

The suspect was identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday evening. Soliman was allegedly heard yelling ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said that it was ""clear this is a targeted act of violence"" and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism.

Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts, including attempted murder, and a federal hate crimes charge.

Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. He arrived in California in 2022 on a non-immigrant visa, the Department of Homeland Security said. That original visa expired in February 2023, and he had applied for asylum. Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs.

The FBI said later Sunday night it was ""conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder"" in El Paso County, Colorado, where Colorado Springs is located.

Soliman has been charged with multiple felony counts and a federal hate crimes charge.

The walk to remember the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza was taking place in Boulder's downtown at the time of the attack. Two sources said witnesses told investigators the suspect also yelled ""End Zionist!"" during the attack.

Police said the victims included eight women and seven men, whose ages range from 25 to 88. One was seriously injured, with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn saying it would be ""safe to say"" that person was in critical condition.

Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told CBS Colorado the 88-year-old victim is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, calling her a ""very loving person."" Another victim is a professor at CU, Wilhelm said.

The people who were injured were outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse at 13th Street and Pearl Street. A burn scar could be seen in the space in front of the building. Witnesses said they saw people writhing on the ground and people running with water to try to help immediately afterward.

UCHealth confirmed that two victims were flown by helicopter to its burn unit. Four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, police said, but they had all either been transferred or discharged later Sunday night, the hospital said. It did not provide specifics on how many had been discharged.

Following the attack, which happened at 1:26 p.m. local time, three blocks of Pearl Street were evacuated. Investigators said there was a vehicle of interest in that zone, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. The evacuations were lifted after nightfall.

Omer Shachar, Run for Their Lives Denver co-leader, told CBS News the group reached out to Boulder police about security concerns surrounding the walk several times before Sunday's event. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.

FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino described the incident as a terrorist attack and said FBI agents were at the scene Sunday afternoon.

U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi released a statement Monday after the federal charge was filed. ""The Department of Justice has swiftly charged the illegal alien perpetrator of this heinous attack with a federal hate crime and will hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Our prayers are with the victims and our Jewish community across the world,"" she said.

Bondi added, ""This vile anti-Semitic violence comes just weeks after the horrific murder of two young Jewish Americans in Washington DC,"" referring to the fatal shooting of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky outside the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21. ""We will never tolerate this kind of hatred. We refuse to accept a world in which Jewish Americans are targeted for who they are and what they believe.""

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on social media that the ""National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Thank you to first responders and local authorities for your quick response and action.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the victims were attacked ""simply because they were Jews"" and that he trusted U.S. authorities would prosecute ""the cold blood perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law,"" according to the Reuters news agency.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack in a news release, saying it was a ""heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.""

""As the Jewish community reels from the recent antisemitic murders in Washington, D.C., it is unfathomable that the community is facing another antisemitic attack here in Boulder, on the eve of the holiday of Shavuot,"" Polis said. ""Several individuals were brutally attacked while peacefully drawing attention to the plight of hostages who have been held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for 604 days. Hate is unacceptable in our Colorado for all, and I condemn this act of terror. The suspect should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Run for Their Lives, which organized the walk, said, ""This is not a protest; it is a peaceful walk to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and a plea for their release."" The group met at 1 p.m. at Pearl Street and 8th Street to walk the length of the Pearl Street Mall and back with a stop at the courthouse for a video.

Ed Victor, who was participating in the walk, said they've been holding these silent marches every week since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack to raise awareness for the hostages still in Gaza. They stop at the courthouse to sing songs, tell stories and read the names of the hostages each week. He said around 30 people were participating in Sunday's walk.

Victor said that the marchers occasionally encounter hecklers, but they try not to respond and continue peacefully down Pearl Street. People also often nod, clap or thank them as they walk by, he added. He said that he never expected that someone would attack them.

""So we stood up, lined up in front of the old Boulder courthouse, and I was actually on the far west side. And there was somebody there that I didn't even notice, although he was making a lot of noise, but I'm just focused on my job of being quiet and getting lined up. And, from my point of view, all of a sudden, I felt the heat. It was a Molotov cocktail equivalent, a gas bomb in a glass jar, thrown. Av [another marcher] saw it, a big flame as high as a tree, and all I saw was someone on fire,"" said Victor.

Victor said they tried to put the fire out. As another marcher with medical experience stepped in to take care of her, Victor stayed with her husband to comfort him. He said volunteers also rushed in to help, bringing water.

""I saw the aftermath,"" said street performer Peter Irish. ""It was like minutes after. I came out, it was chaos, people were writhing on the ground. It was traumatic to watch, to be honest with you. It was chaos.""

University of Colorado system President Todd Saliman said in a statement Sunday, ""My deepest sympathies go out tonight to those keeping weekly vigil who were viciously attacked in Boulder today. I hope that they and their loved ones feel the support of our community as they struggle to comprehend what has happened. I know the shock and horror of today's violent act will have long echoes for each of the victims, their loved ones and members of the community. We must vocally and forcefully condemn this hateful act of violence targeting the Jewish community and prosecute those responsible.""

We are saddened and heartbroken to learn that an incendiary device was thrown at walkers at the Run for Their Lives walk on Pearl Street as they were raising awareness for the hostages still held in Gaza. We don't have all the details of what is unfolding, and we promise to keep our community informed. Our hearts go out to those who witnessed this horrible attack, and prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured. We are in touch with law enforcement about our Boulder Jewish community, and safety is our highest priority. We are working closely with SCN, Boulder PD, and the FBI. We are grateful for the first responders who are caring for our injured. We will continue to work together to share information and provide support for our community. When events like this enter our own community, we are shaken. Our hope is that we come together for one another.

According to the complaint, Soliman lived with his wife and five children in Colorado Springs, a city about 161km (100 miles) south of Boulder. The affidavit says that he waited until after his daughter’s graduation to conduct the attack.

Few other details were available about him.

Todd Lyons, acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit.

Federal documents make no reference to his nationality, but the New York Times said he was Egyptian, citing the Department of Homeland Security.

The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice did not respond to requests for comment. The Denver office of the FBI, which is handling the case, did not immediately respond to emails or phone calls seeking details in the case.

Officials from the Boulder County Jail, Boulder Police and Boulder County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to inquiries.

“There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren’t properly screened that were allowed in,” Lyons said during a press conference in Boston. “I will tell you that’s a huge effort for ICE right now.”

Under former US President Joe Biden, ICE prioritised arrests of serious criminals and called for officers to consider humanitarian factors when making arrests.

Lyons declined to provide more information, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously said Soliman had entered the country in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month. “The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” the spokesperson said.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a “terrible tragedy”.

He blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” he wrote.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years of age were transported to hospitals after the attack, Boulder police said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado, during an event organised by Run for Their Lives, a group devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told CBS Colorado that the 88-year-old victim was a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

Sunday’s attack was not the first high-profile incident of mass violence in Boulder, a university town that attracts many young professionals and outdoor enthusiasts. In 2021, a gunman fatally shot 10 people, including an off-duty police officer, in a local supermarket.",

Rain or shine, he joins his local chapter of Run for Their Lives as they walk through town holding posters that show the hostages’ faces, names and ages.

This Sunday was no different — until that evening, when he scrolled through the news. A man had attacked participants at a separate Run for Their Lives event in Boulder, Colorado — throwing Molotov cocktails and wielding a makeshift flamethrower while shouting “Free Palestine.” Eight people were hospitalized, and a Holocaust survivor was reportedly among those injured.

“It’s something that I’ve been very fearful of and concerned about since we started doing this,” Kessler said. “It’s chilling and frightening that could happen in America in 2025 — that Jews have to fear being out in public as a group.”

The attack comes less than two weeks after two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., after an American Jewish Committee event to discuss getting humanitarian aid to Gaza took place inside. The suspected gunman said “I did it for Gaza,” according to an eyewitness.

The spate of attacks has left Jewish communities grappling with how safe it is to be outwardly Jewish in public, or even to advocate for causes others may interpret as Jewish or pro-Israel. That has left groups such as Run for Their Lives weighing how to continue their activism without putting participants at risk.

Run for Their Lives started in the Bay Area after the Oct. 7 attacks and now has 230 chapters around the world, including in Australia, Africa, Europe and South America. Groups walk or run 1 kilometer, meant to take about 18 minutes (a number associated with the Hebrew word “chai,” which translates to “life”). They wear matching red T-shirts, and carry flags representing the hostages’ countries of origin.

A line on the Run for Their Lives website FAQs now reads as eerily prophetic.

“I’m concerned for my safety,” one question reads.

“That’s a valid concern these days,” the response acknowledges. “Make your best judgment to decide if it’s safe.”

From its start, the group has emphasized its non-political nature. Kessler said the group doesn’t chant slogans when they walk, and organizers welcome people of all political stripes.

“The fact that there are still hostages is a humanitarian issue. It’s not a political issue,” he said. “Some of the reports that I’ve seen in the last 24 hours calling the Run for Their Lives group a protest or pro-Israeli is really wrong. It’s not in any way.”

He added that while police joined Run for Their Lives at the Westfield group’s first few walks, the event has never had formal security. Now, he is reassessing that choice. “It’s really scary,” the 48-year-old attorney said.

Miri Kornfeld, leader of Denver’s Run for Their Lives group, told NewsNation that after the killings earlier this month outside the Capital Jewish Museum, her group hired an armed security guard to accompany them through town.

Now the Denver chapter of Run for Their Lives has cancelled its events for the foreseeable future. Secure Community Network, the consultancy for Jewish groups, has advised groups against canceling events so that attackers won’t be perceived as getting a win. On Monday afternoon it hosted a seminar to review best measures for protecting outdoor events.

Kessler said he won’t be deterred from walking for the hostages. “It’s not going to stop us from continuing to do what we believe is the right thing,” he said.

Penny Lee Berman, a 74-year-old former school teacher in Brooklyn, has attended her local chapter of Run for Their Lives in Sheepshead Bay almost every Sunday since last January. Her group walks with a police escort, and she hadn’t previously felt unsafe — despite the occasional “F— Israel” or “Free Palestine” yelled in the group’s direction.

She, too, wants to keep marching.

“I don’t want anyone getting hurt, but I don’t want terrorists controlling decent people and how we stand up for ourselves,” she said. “But I won’t be terrified. I’ll be a little scared, not gonna lie. But I’m not going to stop.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the timing of the Capital Jewish Museum shooting. It took place after an American Jewish Committee event took place inside, not while it was happening.",Run for Their Lives organizers weigh how to continue their activism without putting participants at risk.

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)

The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.

Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”

At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.

The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”

A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”

“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”

At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.

“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.

Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.

J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”

“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”

FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.

“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.

All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.

“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

Mayor Adams says while there are no credible threats against New York’s Jewish community, the NYPD is stepping up security at religious sites around the city.

The suspect in Sunday’s attack in Boulder, Colorado, is under arrest. Witnesses described him throwing Molotov cocktails into a peaceful rally for the release of hostages being held in Gaza.

Twelve people were injured in the attack. At least two of the victims are in critical condition.

The Department of Homeland Security says the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, had been living illegally in the U.S. since his visa expired in 2023.

The attack comes just two weeks after the deadly terrorist shooting of two Israeli Embassy workers in Washington, D.C.

Joshua Kramer with the American Jewish Committee says the Jewish community in the city and around the country is reeling and calls on everyday people to stand up against hate.

The NYPD posted the following statement on social media: “We are monitoring the horrific attack in Colorado targeting an event for Israeli hostages.

Now, the White House says he's in the U.S. illegally and should be deported.

A Colorado man has been charged with a federal hate crime for his alleged role in a gasoline-bomb attack at a pro-Israeli rally that injured eight people in Boulder, Colo., state and federal law enforcement officials said Monday.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was already facing an array of state charges, including attempted murder, after the attack on Sunday on a group seeking to draw attention to hostages seized in the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023.

""No one should ever be subjected to violence of any kind, but our laws recognize that such violence is particularly pernicious when someone is targeted because of their race, their religion or their national origin,"" J. Bishop Grewell, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Colorado, said at a news conference on Monday.

""My office and our partners hope justice will help heal the people in this community and in the communities throughout the country shaken by yesterday's attack.""

An affidavit filed by the U.S. Justice Department on Monday said Soliman, 45, had planned the attack for more than a year. Investigators found 14 gasoline-filled Molotov cocktails near where the suspect was detained.

The police also found a gasoline canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with gasoline at the scene. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the fire bombs from YouTube.

The affidavit refers to a video posted on social media during the attack showing Soliman ""shirtless, pacing back and forth while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails.""

The suspect, who was being detained in lieu of $10 million US bail, according to official records, told police he ""wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,"" the affidavit said.

The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans linked to outrage over Israel's escalating military offensive in Gaza. It followed the fatal shooting of two Israel Embassy aides outside Washington, D.C.'s Capital Jewish Museum last month.

According to the complaint, Soliman lived with his wife and five children in Colorado Springs, a city about 160 kilometres south of Boulder. The affidavit said that he waited until after his daughter's graduation to conduct the attack.

Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit.

The departments of Homeland Security and Justice did not respond to requests for comment. The Denver office of the FBI, which is handling the case, did not immediately respond to emails or phone calls seeking details in the case.

""There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren't properly screened that were allowed in,"" Lyons said during a news conference in Boston. ""I will tell you that's a huge effort for ICE right now.""

Lyons declined to provide more information, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously said Soliman had entered the country in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month.

""The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,"" the spokesperson said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said in a social media post that such attacks would not be tolerated. ""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he said.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years of age were transported to hospitals after the attack, Boulder police said. Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told CBS Colorado that the 88-year-old victim was a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

Officials on Monday said four more people with minor injuries have also come forward.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado, during an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of the 2023 attack on Israel.

A Colorado man has been charged with a federal hate crime for his alleged role in a gasoline-bomb attack at a pro-Israeli rally that injured eight people in Boulder, Colo., state and federal law enforcement officials said Monday.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was already facing an array of state charges, including attempted murder, after the attack on Sunday on a group seeking to draw attention to hostages seized in the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023.

""My office and our partners hope justice will help heal the people in this community and in the communities throughout the country shaken by yesterday's attack.""

An affidavit filed by the U.S. Justice Department on Monday said Soliman, 45, had planned the attack for more than a year. Investigators found 14 gasoline-filled Molotov cocktails near where the suspect was detained.

The police also found a gasoline canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with gasoline at the scene. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the fire bombs from YouTube.

According to court documents, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, admitted to carrying out the attack and said he had planned it for a year in advance. He also told authorities he would do it again, the documents say.

""He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,"" an FBI agent stated in the criminal complaint.

The man wore a high-visibility vest and posed as a gardener in order to get closer to his intended victims, according to police reporting.

Authorities said Monday afternoon that Soliman was not on their radar. He is believed to have acted alone.

Police said Soliman used a makeshift flamethrower and threw two incendiary devices into a group of demonstrators who were rallying in support of hostages still held in Gaza. Witnesses said he yelled, “Free Palestine” at the crowd.

Officials said Soliman also carried gasoline in a backpack sprayer, but told investigators he had only used it on himself.

""There were 16 unused Molotov cocktails within arm's reach of the subject at the time of his arrest,"" said FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Mark Michalek.

The attack injured 12 people. Authorities initially announced eight people had been injured, but later updated their count after updating additional victims.

At least eight people, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were hospitalized with burn injuries, including one whose clothing had caught fire. Officials said two people were airlifted to a burn unit at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora. One of the victims is reportedly a Holocaust survivor.

The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of terrorism. Agents were seen at Soliman’s home in El Paso County, about 100 miles south of Boulder.

According to the criminal complaint, Soliman told authorities that he lived with his wife and five children.

""He stated he left an iPhone at the house, hidden in a desk drawer, with messages to his family,"" the criminal complaint says. ""He also stated that he left a journal inside his house.""

When agents arrived at Soliman's house, his wife was observed leaving. She reportedly went to the local police station and turned over the iPhone.

Soliman is being held at the Boulder County Jail on a $10 million bond. He made a brief court appearance Monday but did not speak. His next hearing, where the charges will be reviewed, is scheduled for June 5. If convicted of the most serious charges, he could face life in prison.

Adding complexity to the case, federal officials said Soliman was in the U.S. illegally.

""Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,"" President Donald Trump said in a statement. ""He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under 'TRUMP' Policy.""

""Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law,"" he added. ""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!""

The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.

Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”

At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.

The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”

A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”

“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”

At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.

“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.

Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.

J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”

“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”

FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.

“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.

All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.

“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect accused in the “targeted terror attack” in Boulder, Colorado, where a pro-Israel group was advocating for Hamas to release the Israeli hostages, was in the United States illegally.

President Trump posted the following to TRUTH Social:

Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America. He came in through Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under “TRUMP” Policy. Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy, and the Great People of Boulder, Colorado!

Soliman, 45, arrived in the U.S. from Egypt in August 2022 on a tourist visa that allowed him to stay until February 2023. He later applied for work authorization, which extended his legal status through March 28, 2024—meaning he had been in the country illegally for the past two months.

According to a federal complaint, Soliman hurled two homemade Molotov cocktails at members of a group called Run For Their Lives — many of them elderly — as they held a walk to raise awareness for hostages still held by Hamas after the October 7, 2023, terror attack.

Four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88 were injured in Sunday’s attack.

Soliman was arrested and was charged Monday with committing a federal hate crime. He also faces state charges, including first-degree attempted murder.","President Trump hit TRUTH Social on Monday to react to the horrific anti-Semitic attack in Boulder, Colorado; Trump blamed Joe Biden's "

In the aftermath of two violent attacks against Jewish people in just 11 days, advocates say their fears and warnings are coming to fruition.

""Our Jewish community and ADL have been screaming from the hilltops that this is going to be the natural result of anti-Jewish, antisemitic rhetoric,"" said Rebecca Weininger, the Deputy Regional Director for the Midwest Anti-Defamation League. ""The minute that we stop being able to distinguish between First Amendment protected criticism of elected officials, and actual hate and violent hate and rhetoric against Jews... then not only is this violence predictable, it’s only going to get worse.”

Two weeks ago two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot and killed in Washington D.C, after which investigators say the suspect shouted that he did it ""for Gaza.""

And again over the weekend in Boulder Colorado a man is charged with a federal hate crime for using incendiary devices to set pro-Israel marchers on fire. The group was standing in solidarity for the hostages in Gaza and calling for their release.

The suspect in that attack is now facing charges of first-degree murder at the state level in addition to the federal hate crime charges, according to prosecutors.

""It's difficult to not be outraged by what happened,"" said Kelley Szany, the Senior VP of Education at the Holocaust Museum.

She believes the tolerance and indifference of antisemetic rhetoric have helped fuel violent attacks.

""I think its so important to remember when we look at the history of the Holocaust that the Nazis didn’t start with gas chambers,"" she said. ""They started with words, they started with propaganda, they started with laws that began to exclude and separate people.""

According to the NBC News affiliate in Denver, one of the victims in the Boulder attack is a Holocaust survivor.","Advocates around the U.S. believe recent attacks against Jewish people, including Sunday's in Colorado, stem from tolerance of hateful rhetoric."

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation on Monday that the Egyptian national accused of using a flamethrower and Molotov cocktails on a Jewish group Sunday had entered the United States during the Biden administration and overstayed a visa which expired in February 2023. Emmer torched Democrats for allowing millions of illegal migrants to cross the southern border under Biden and accused the party’s agenda of being “antisemitic,” in an exclusive statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: ‘Reckless’: Mike Huckabee Slams Media For Pushing Hamas ‘Propaganda’ Hours Before Colorado Terror Attack)

“Make no mistake: The horrific terrorist attack in Boulder is a direct result of the Democrats’ antisemitic, open-borders agenda,” Emmer told the DCNF in a statement Monday.

Emmer also credited House Republicans for standing with Jewish Americans while the country endures a spate of violent anti-Semitic attacks and keeping Americans safe by supporting the president’s deportation and immigration enforcement efforts.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, House Republicans are working overtime to ensure the Jewish community is protected and radical, illegal immigrants have no refuge in America.”

“The Colorado Terrorist attack suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” a DHS spokesperson told the DCNF in a statement. “He entered the country in August 2022 on a B2 visa that expired on February 2023. He filed for asylum in September 2022.”

Soliman allegedly yelled “Free Palestine” before committing the act of terror against the pro-Israeli demonstrators. The Egyptian national told police that he “wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead.”

The Trump administration’s Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Soliman with a federal hate crime on Monday. In a press release, Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the DOJ will hold the suspect “accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”

No House Democrats voted “yes” on H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, in May 2023 which would have increased civil and criminal penalties on foreign nationals who overstay their visa.

Congressional Democrats have also largely opposed GOP-backed legislation to crack down on illegal immigration, including the Laken Riley Act. Just 46 Democratic lawmakers joined their Republican colleagues in January to support legislation that would allow federal immigration authorities to detain illegal migrants for committing an array of criminal offenses.

Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social that the terror suspect entered the United States “through Biden’s ridiculous Open Borders Policy.”

“He must go out under ‘TRUMP’ Policy,” Trump added. “This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

The Trump administration announced in April that encounters with illegal migrants at the southern border were down by 95% and that the number of “gotaways” — illegal immigrants released into the United States — decreased by 99% a year prior.

Every House Democrat voted against the president’s sweeping tax and spending bill, which allocates nearly $50 billion for border wall construction and an additional $12 billion in reimbursements to border states for combating illegal immigration during the Biden administration.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman was already facing an array of state charges, including attempted murder, after the attack on Sunday in the city of Boulder on a group seeking to draw attention to hostages seized in Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an “antisemitic terror attack”.

The affidavit said Soliman, 45, had planned the attack for more than a year. Investigators found 14 Molotov cocktails filled with petrol or gasoline near where the suspect was detained.

The police also found a petrol canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with petrol at the scene. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the firebombs from YouTube.

The affidavit references a video posted on social media during the attack showing Soliman “shirtless, pacing back and forth while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails”.

The suspect, who was being detained in lieu of $10m bail, according to official records, told police he “wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead”, the affidavit said.

The burst of violence at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder, unfolded against the backdrop of Israel’s war on Gaza that continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in anti-Semitic violence in the United States.

The attack happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, which is marked with the reading of the Torah and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.

According to the complaint, Soliman lived with his wife and five children in Colorado Springs, a city about 161km (100 miles) south of Boulder. The affidavit says that he waited until after his daughter’s graduation to conduct the attack.

Few other details were available about him.

Todd Lyons, acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit.

Federal documents make no reference to his nationality, but the New York Times said he was Egyptian, citing the Department of Homeland Security.

The Departments of Homeland Security and Justice did not respond to requests for comment. The Denver office of the FBI, which is handling the case, did not immediately respond to emails or phone calls seeking details in the case.

Officials from the Boulder County Jail, Boulder Police and Boulder County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to inquiries.

“There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren’t properly screened that were allowed in,” Lyons said during a press conference in Boston. “I will tell you that’s a huge effort for ICE right now.”

Under former US President Joe Biden, ICE prioritised arrests of serious criminals and called for officers to consider humanitarian factors when making arrests.

Lyons declined to provide more information, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously said Soliman had entered the country in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month. “The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,” the spokesperson said.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a “terrible tragedy”.

He blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” he wrote.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years of age were transported to hospitals after the attack, Boulder police said.

The attack took place on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado, during an event organised by Run for Their Lives, a group devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel.

Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told CBS Colorado that the 88-year-old victim was a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

BREAKING: New details on Colorado terror attack suspect as Feds charge him with federal hate crime. According to federal court filings obtained by @FoxNews, Egyptian illegal alien Mohamed Soliman admitted in an interview that he wants to kill all ‘Zionist’ people and had been planning the attack for a year, and that he would conduct the attack again if he could. He allegedly told investigators that he waited to carry out the attack until his daughter graduated high school, and that he specifically targeted the ‘Zionist group’ in Boulder after learning about them from an online search. It was premeditated - as he allegedly admitted he knew they would gather on Sunday at 1pm. He arrived and waited for them. Additionally, investigators found a black container with 14 more molotov cocktails near the spot he was arrested in. Inside his vehicle, investigators found paperwork with the words ‘Israel’, ‘Palestine’, and ‘USAID’. This man was admitted into the country via a tourist visa during the Biden administration. He overstayed, filed an asylum request, and was granted work authorization by the Biden admin, which expired at the end of March of this year.

Second, let’s enlarge those images from the indictment.

Besides what Mr. Melugin noted, we call attention to a detail toward the end showing that Soliman’s wife seems to have voluntarily given up his cell phone to Boulder Police. So we might not automatically assume she approves of her husband’s behavior.

The indictment also seems to verify the authenticity of the videos where it showed what appeared to be Soliman standing around shirtless, in sunglasses, carrying what looks like a pair of Molotovs. We find this video uniquely interesting and you should absolutely click on it if you haven't seen it:

Apparently, several people were confronting Soliman but were afraid to approach too closely because he looked like he had two more Molotovs. And in the middle of it, you hear a woman say ‘I wish I had my gun with me, I would do it.’ This suggests that if she was armed, she could have done something to stop him immediately.

We don’t know if this was a gun free zone, but we can hardly think of a better advertisement of 1) ordinary people being allowed to carry a gun in nearly every place and 2) ordinary people actually carrying their guns whenever they legally can. The Second Amendment won’t protect you unless you actually exercise your rights under it.

Heh. As a point of fact, it became clear that this crime fit the definition of terrorism under federal law pretty early on. 18 U.S.C. § 2331(5) states the following:

So, first it has to be dangerous to human life… check.

Second, it has violate either federal or state law... check.

Third, it can be triggered if it appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population… check.

Fourth, it has to take place in America… check.

Indeed, to expand on the third point a little bit, we only listed one of several motives that can trigger the statute, and it is important to note that it only has to appear to have that motivation.

Allow us to illustrate this point about appearances. Imagine if a number of criminals took office workers hostage at Nakatomi Plaza, on Christmas in 1988. Imagine further that when authorities arrived, their leader, Hans Gruber, claimed that this was motivated by politics and demanded the release of dozens of terrorists around the world. And if this is all starting to sound a little familiar, here’s the scene where that happened in Die Hard (with a language warning, because this is Die Hard—yippee ki yay):

But if you have seen that Christmas movie, you know what the plot twist is going to be. And, if you haven’t, this is your SPOILER WARNING. The hostage takers weren’t actually interested in politics at all. In fact, they were doing everything in an attempt to rob the Nakatomi Corporation. So, in that scenario, their actual motive would be robbery, but they would appear to be motivated by one of the three motivations outlined in 18 U.S.C. § 2331(5)(B), namely they sought to ‘influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion’ by saying they wanted various people freed from captivity. The fact that they were full of it is irrelevant to this statute.

All of which is a roundabout way of saying that McCabe is an idiot, who doesn't know what the law actually says, or hasn't figured out what it means.

Actually, we suspect he waited until graduation because he believed that she would be deported, or that his crime would otherwise disrupt her education.

Was he also motivated by the hysteria over USAID cuts? Does Bono have blood on his hands?

It is theoretically possible for a person to hate ‘Zionists’ without that person actually hating Jews, but we haven’t seen someone pull that off in the real world.

Finally, we have this:

That supposedly weak statement is here:

That would be a picture of his commentary on TruthSocial. That post reads:

It's not perfect, but we wouldn’t call that weak. And the notion that Trump has some kind of special responsibility because it happened under his watch just doesn’t make sense. Soliman was admitted under Biden. This current administration is doing their best to clean up the mess Biden and his autopen left behind, but estimates of illegal immigrants are typically at over 10 million people (we suspect the number is more like twice that amount) and they are not all going to be thrown out overnight—especially with the level of judicial interference we have seen in recent months. One should be careful about assigning blame to past presidents for current events, but this one is clearly on Biden, at least in part. Or at least on whoever was actually running things when he was nominally president.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, told investigators that he wanted to ""kill all Zionist people"" but had delayed committing the attack in the city of Boulder until after his daughter had graduated from high school, according to state and federal court documents charging him with attempted murder, assault and a federal hate crime.

Police and FBI affidavits quoted the suspect as saying he had learned to shoot a gun in a class he took for the purpose of obtaining a concealed-carry permit but ended up using Molotov cocktails because of his immigration status. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the fire bombs from YouTube.

Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit.

Trump administration officials immediately seized on Sunday's violence as an example of why they are cracking down on illegal immigration.

A police affidavit filed in support of Soliman's arrest warrant said he was born in Egypt, lived in Kuwait for 17 years and moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder, where he lived with his wife and five children.

""In light of yesterday’s horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X.

According to the Boulder police affidavit, Soliman had planned for a year to carry out the attack, which unfolded on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado.

The victims, many of them elderly, were taking part in an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel.

The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans linked to outrage over Israel's escalating military offensive in Gaza. It followed the fatal shooting of two Israel Embassy aides that took place outside Washington's Capital Jewish Museum last month.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an ""antisemitic terror attack.""

Authorities said they found 16 gasoline-filled Molotov cocktails near where the suspect was detained.

The police also found a gasoline canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with gasoline at the scene. The federal affidavit references a video posted on social media during the attack showing Soliman ""shirtless, pacing back and forth while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails.""

During a brief court appearance on Monday, Soliman appeared via a video feed from the Boulder County Jail, standing and wearing an orange jumpsuit. He answered ""yes"" to some procedural questions from the judge but otherwise did not speak.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, said during the hearing that she would reserve any arguments regarding his bond conditions until a future date.

The suspect faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty on the federal hate crime charge because he was also charged with attempted-murder charges in state court.

The multiple counts of attempted murder are punishable by up to 384 years in prison.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously said Soliman had entered the United States in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month. ""The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,"" the spokesperson said.

""There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren't properly screened that were allowed in,"" Lyons, the acting ICE director, said during a press conference in Boston. ""I will tell you that's a huge effort for ICE right now.""

He explained that the actor, whom he had just married on Valentine’s Day, pushed him out of the line of fire at the site of their former home, which had burned down following repeated threats.

“[The neighbor] started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired. Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side-by-side. When the man fired, Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life,” Tristan Kern de Gonzales wrote in a Facebook post on Monday.

Joss’ neighbor, identified as Sigfredo Alvarez-Cega, was arrested a block away. Alvarez-Cega, who reportedly got into a heated argument with Joss before killing him, has been charged with murder.

De Gonzales explained that before the neighbor with the gun appeared, they were horrified to discover “the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw,” he said.

“He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other. I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved,” de Gonzales wrote.

He also explained that during the two years he and Joss had lived at the site, that “people in the area … repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.”

He added that they were “harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship” from people who were “openly homophobic.” De Gonzales said that he and Joss were still newlyweds who were looking for a trailer and “planning our future.”

He thanked Joss’ friends and fans, concluding his post with, “My focus now is on protecting Jonathan’s legacy and honoring the life we built together … Jonathan saved my life.

Those injured included an 88-year-old woman, who is a Holocaust refugee from Europe. Rabbi Israel Wilhem, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado in Boulder, told CBS Colorado she is ""very loving person.""

""Holocaust survivors should not spend the final chapter of their lives experiencing or witnessing this hatred again,"" Leo Terrell, the Justice Department official in charge of the antisemitism task force,"" posted on X. ""We must fight this terror together.""

Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said the newly identified victims suffered minor injuries and learned about them when they came forward to be interviewed.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, whose mother was born in a concentration camp and his grandparents survived the Holocaust, said the attack was ""very cruel"" and has ""every single hallmark of being a hate crime.""

""This was a peaceful march done every single week by the Jewish community, calling out the injustices of the hostages, and they were attacked because of who they are,"" he said on MSNBC. ""It is heart-wrenching for all of us in Colorado.""

Mark Michalek, the FBI special agent in charge, said witnesses reported hearing the suspect yell ""Free Palestine"" during the attack.

""It is clear that this is a targeted act of violence and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism,"" he said.

The suspect told investigators he ""wanted to kill all Zionist people"" and ""he would do it again,"" according to an affidavit filed Monday.

Soliman told investigators the attack was planned for a year, according to a federal criminal complaint, and he arrived at the gathering about five minutes before it started.

He said he looked up videos on how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and purchased the items needed to make them, the complaint stated.

A black plastic container with 14 unlit Molotov cocktails was found near where he was arrested. It include ""glass wine carafe bottles or Ball jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles,"" the affidavit said.

Soliman ""mentioned several times he wanted to be dead"" in interviews with law enforcement, the warrant read.

Soliman was not on the authorities' radar before the attack.

Boulder's Redfearn said his officers didn't have previous ""contacts"" with him.

One witness told NBC News he was dressed like a groundskeeper.

""When I walked by the gentleman, I didn't know who he was, but thought he was out of place and odd,"" Lisa Turnquist, 66, said. ""It wasn't 10 seconds later, I felt fluid on my leg and another lady had been burned.""

Turnquist, who was not injured, said she was with about 20 other members of Boulder Run for Their Lives when they were attacked.

On Monday, Turnquist, who is Jewish and lives in Louisville, placed flowers at a makeshift memorial.

The pro-Israel advocacy group the Anti-Defamation League said the demonstrators attacked in a statement were participants of the weekly Run for Their Lives event, which sees Jewish community members run and walk in solidarity with Israeli hostages in Hamas captivity.

""Today, America bore witness to yet another heinous act of anti-Semitism designed to terrorize a peaceful community,"" Colorado Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement Sunday.

""This type of hate-filled violence has no place in our civilized society and must be universally condemned.""

The attack, which was near Pearl St. Mall in downtown Boulder, occurred just before 1:30 p.m. MDT, authorities said. Police found victims suffering from burns.

The ADL on Sunday said, ""We're witnessing a global campaign of intimidation and terror deliberately directed against the Jewish people.""

According to the ADL, there have been nine plots or attacks allegedly targeting Jews or Jewish institutions in the United States in the past 11 months, a sharp increase compared with seven January 2020 to June of last year.

Trump wrote on Truth Social that Sunday's attack ""will not be tolerated.""

""He came in through Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy, which has hurt our Country so badly. He must go out under 'TRUMP' Policy,"" the president said.

""Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law,"" Trump wrote. ""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, told investigators that he wanted to ""kill all Zionist people"" but had delayed committing the attack in the city of Boulder until after his daughter had graduated from high school, according to state and federal court documents charging him with attempted murder, assault and a federal hate crime.

Police and FBI affidavits quoted the suspect as saying he had learned to shoot a gun in a class he took for the purpose of obtaining a concealed-carry permit but ended up using Molotov cocktails because of his immigration status. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the fire bombs from YouTube.

Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit.

Trump administration officials immediately seized on Sunday's violence as an example of why they are cracking down on illegal immigration.

A police affidavit filed in support of Soliman's arrest warrant said he was born in Egypt, lived in Kuwait for 17 years and moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder, where he lived with his wife and five children.

""In light of yesterday’s horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X.

According to the Boulder police affidavit, Soliman had planned for a year to carry out the attack, which unfolded on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado.

The victims, many of them elderly, were taking part in an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel.

The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans linked to outrage over Israel's escalating military offensive in Gaza. It followed the fatal shooting of two Israel Embassy aides that took place outside Washington's Capital Jewish Museum last month.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an ""antisemitic terror attack.""

Authorities said they found 16 gasoline-filled Molotov cocktails near where the suspect was detained.

The police also found a gasoline canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with gasoline at the scene. The federal affidavit references a video posted on social media during the attack showing Soliman ""shirtless, pacing back and forth while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails.""

During a brief court appearance on Monday, Soliman appeared via a video feed from the Boulder County Jail, standing and wearing an orange jumpsuit. He answered ""yes"" to some procedural questions from the judge but otherwise did not speak.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, said during the hearing that she would reserve any arguments regarding his bond conditions until a future date.

The suspect faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty on the federal hate crime charge because he was also charged with attempted-murder charges in state court.

The multiple counts of attempted murder are punishable by up to 384 years in prison.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously said Soliman had entered the United States in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month. ""The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,"" the spokesperson said.

""There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren't properly screened that were allowed in,"" Lyons, the acting ICE director, said during a press conference in Boston. ""I will tell you that's a huge effort for ICE right now.""

U.S. President Donald Trump said in a social media post that such attacks would not be tolerated. ""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he said.

Under former President Joe Biden, ICE prioritized arrests of serious criminals and called for officers to consider humanitarian factors when making arrests.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years of age were transported to hospitals after Sunday's attack, Boulder police said. On Monday, local authorities said four more surviving victims had since been identified.

Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told CBS Colorado that the 88-year-old victim was a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

Sunday's attack was not the first high-profile incident of mass violence in Boulder, a university town that attracts many young professionals and outdoor enthusiasts.

Mohamed Soliman is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and using a makeshift flamethrower on a group of people at a rally in support of Israeli hostages - with the FBI describing the incident as a targeted ""act of terrorism"".

The 45-year-old, from El Paso County, Colorado, shouted ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, it is alleged.

A total of 12 victims were injured and taken to hospitals, authorities said. One of those was at one point said to be in a critical condition.

A federal criminal complaint (court filing) said Soliman confessed to the attack, told investigators that he had planned it for a year, said he ""wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead"", and that ""he would do it again"".

At a press conference on Monday evening, 20th judicial district attorney Michael Dougherty said ""Boulder is a beautiful and special place, but we're not immune from mass violence or hate crimes"" as he explained the charges against Soliman.

He said that the suspect faces 16 counts of attempted murder in the first-degree, with eight of those for attempted murder with intent and after deliberation, meaning he had time to consider his crimes.

The other eight counts relate to attempted murder with extreme indifference, meaning he acted without regard to others' lives.

Soliman is also charged with eight counts of first-degree assault, two counts of use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

If convicted on all charges pursued by the state prosecutor, and if they run consecutively, Soliman faces a maximum sentence of 624 years in prison.

Mr Dougherty added that the US attorney's office ""will be prosecuting the hate crime against the defendant,"" which relates to the federal crime of causing bodily injury because of actual or perceived race, colour, religion, or national origin.

After the press conference, Soliman made his first appearance in court, appearing via web link from Boulder County Jail.

During the brief hearing, Judge Nancy Salomone asked the suspect if received the protection order issued by the court preventing him from contacting the victims, to which he said ""yes"".

She then said she will see legal representatives on Thursday for the filing of the charges.","Mohamed Soliman is in custody and has been charged with several counts of attempted murder, first-degree assault, and attempted use of an incendiary device."

BREAKING: New details on Colorado terror attack suspect as Feds charge him with federal hate crime. According to federal court filings obtained by @FoxNews, Egyptian illegal alien Mohamed Soliman admitted in an interview that he wants to kill all ‘Zionist’ people and had been planning the attack for a year, and that he would conduct the attack again if he could. He allegedly told investigators that he waited to carry out the attack until his daughter graduated high school, and that he specifically targeted the ‘Zionist group’ in Boulder after learning about them from an online search. It was premeditated - as he allegedly admitted he knew they would gather on Sunday at 1pm. He arrived and waited for them. Additionally, investigators found a black container with 14 more molotov cocktails near the spot he was arrested in. Inside his vehicle, investigators found paperwork with the words ‘Israel’, ‘Palestine’, and ‘USAID’. This man was admitted into the country via a tourist visa during the Biden administration. He overstayed, filed an asylum request, and was granted work authorization by the Biden admin, which expired at the end of March of this year.

Second, let’s enlarge those images from the indictment.

Besides what Mr. Melugin noted, we call attention to a detail toward the end showing that Soliman’s wife seems to have voluntarily given up his cell phone to Boulder Police. So we might not automatically assume she approves of her husband’s behavior.

The indictment also seems to verify the authenticity of the videos where it showed what appeared to be Soliman standing around shirtless, in sunglasses, carrying what looks like a pair of Molotovs. We find this video uniquely interesting and you should absolutely click on it if you haven't seen it:

Apparently, several people were confronting Soliman but were afraid to approach too closely because he looked like he had two more Molotovs. And in the middle of it, you hear a woman say ‘I wish I had my gun with me, I would do it.’ This suggests that if she was armed, she could have done something to stop him immediately.

We don’t know if this was a gun free zone, but we can hardly think of a better advertisement of 1) ordinary people being allowed to carry a gun in nearly every place and 2) ordinary people actually carrying their guns whenever they legally can. The Second Amendment won’t protect you unless you actually exercise your rights under it.

Heh. As a point of fact, it became clear that this crime fit the definition of terrorism under federal law pretty early on. 18 U.S.C. § 2331(5) states the following:

So, first it has to be dangerous to human life… check.

Second, it has violate either federal or state law... check.

Third, it can be triggered if it appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population… check.

Fourth, it has to take place in America… check.

Indeed, to expand on the third point a little bit, we only listed one of several motives that can trigger the statute, and it is important to note that it only has to appear to have that motivation.

Allow us to illustrate this point about appearances. Imagine if a number of criminals took office workers hostage at Nakatomi Plaza, on Christmas in 1988. Imagine further that when authorities arrived, their leader, Hans Gruber, claimed that this was motivated by politics and demanded the release of dozens of terrorists around the world. And if this is all starting to sound a little familiar, here’s the scene where that happened in Die Hard (with a language warning, because this is Die Hard—yippee ki yay):

But if you have seen that Christmas movie, you know what the plot twist is going to be. And, if you haven’t, this is your SPOILER WARNING. The hostage takers weren’t actually interested in politics at all. In fact, they were doing everything in an attempt to rob the Nakatomi Corporation. So, in that scenario, their actual motive would be robbery, but they would appear to be motivated by one of the three motivations outlined in 18 U.S.C. § 2331(5)(B), namely they sought to ‘influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion’ by saying they wanted various people freed from captivity. The fact that they were full of it is irrelevant to this statute.

All of which is a roundabout way of saying that McCabe is an idiot, who doesn't know what the law actually says, or hasn't figured out what it means.

Actually, we suspect he waited until graduation because he believed that she would be deported, or that his crime would otherwise disrupt her education.

Was he also motivated by the hysteria over USAID cuts? Does Bono have blood on his hands?

It is theoretically possible for a person to hate ‘Zionists’ without that person actually hating Jews, but we haven’t seen someone pull that off in the real world.

Finally, we have this:

That supposedly weak statement is here:

That would be a picture of his commentary on TruthSocial. That post reads:

It's not perfect, but we wouldn’t call that weak. And the notion that Trump has some kind of special responsibility because it happened under his watch just doesn’t make sense. Soliman was admitted under Biden. This current administration is doing their best to clean up the mess Biden and his autopen left behind, but estimates of illegal immigrants are typically at over 10 million people (we suspect the number is more like twice that amount) and they are not all going to be thrown out overnight—especially with the level of judicial interference we have seen in recent months. One should be careful about assigning blame to past presidents for current events, but this one is clearly on Biden, at least in part. Or at least on whoever was actually running things when he was nominally president.

A Muslim illegal alien who came into the US under Biden has been arrested for a firebomb attack on a Jewish parade in Boulder, Colorado. The parade which was at the start of a Jewish holiday was called in remembrance of the Israeli hostages being held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza.. The terrorist attacker, Mohammed Soliman, threw Molotov cocktails at the parade, injuring six participants, one of whom is fighting for her life in the hospital. One of the victims was a Holocaust survivor. Soliman shouted ""Free Palestine"" as he threw the Molotov cocktails. The illegal alien, who is from Egypt entered the US during the Biden open borders regime. He said after his arrest that he would like to undertake more attacks on Jewish targets. Both Colorado authorities and big media tried to cover up the matter, described the Muslim terrorist simply as ""a white man"" and saying that his motivations were unknown. President Trump called him out for what he is, however, a terrorist. This follows shortly after the shooting to death of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC by a BLM activist who was also shouting ""Free Palestine.

During a brief court appearance on Monday, Soliman appeared via a video feed from the Boulder County Jail, standing and wearing an orange jumpsuit. He answered ""yes"" to some procedural questions from the judge but otherwise did not speak.

Soliman's attorney, public defender Kathryn Herold, said during the hearing that she would reserve any arguments regarding his bond conditions until a future date.

The suspect faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty on the federal hate crime charge because he was also charged with attempted-murder charges in state court.

The multiple counts of attempted murder are punishable by up to 384 years in prison.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously said Soliman had entered the United States in August 2022 and filed for asylum the following month. ""The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, is illegally in our country,"" the spokesperson said.

""There are millions of individuals like this that we are attempting to locate from the past administration that weren't properly screened that were allowed in,"" Lyons, the acting ICE director, said during a press conference in Boston. ""I will tell you that's a huge effort for ICE right now.""

U.S. President Donald Trump said in a social media post that such attacks would not be tolerated. ""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he said.

Under former President Joe Biden, ICE prioritized arrests of serious criminals and called for officers to consider humanitarian factors when making arrests.

Four women and four men between 52 and 88 years of age were transported to hospitals after Sunday's attack, Boulder police said. On Monday, local authorities said four more surviving victims had since been identified.

Rabbi Yisroel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told CBS Colorado that the 88-year-old victim was a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe.

Sunday's attack was not the first high-profile incident of mass violence in Boulder, a university town that attracts many young professionals and outdoor enthusiasts.

FBI agent Mark Michalek said the suspect used “a makeshift flame-thrower” and “was heard to yell ‘free Palestine’,” during the attack.

An FBI affidavit said Soliman had been planning the assault for a year.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the affidavit says.

“He hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over ‘our land’, which he explained to be Palestine.”

Agents said they had found at least 14 unused Molotov cocktails and a backpack weed sprayer containing petrol.

US Homeland Security officials said he was in the country illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.

President Donald Trump lashed out at his predecessor, Joe Biden, over the attack.

“Yesterday’s horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,” Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a “terrible tragedy”.

He blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing Soliman into the country.

“This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,” he wrote.

The attack occurred on Sunday afternoon local time during a regular demonstration in support of hostages taken in the assault on Israel by Hamas gunmen on October 7, 2023.

In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

In another video, a police officer rushes to arrest the same man, who is lying on the grass. Several people are milling around nearby.

Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that “at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition”.

The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.

Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt “very, very scared” after hearing about the attack near his workplace.

The attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted “Free Palestine,” was arrested.

Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.

“Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border - it is already burning the streets of America,” he said.",The victim count from the attack in the US rises to 12.

Mohamed Soliman is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and using a makeshift flamethrower on a group of people at a rally in support of Israeli hostages - with the FBI describing the incident as a targeted ""act of terrorism"".

The 45-year-old, from El Paso County, Colorado, shouted ""Free Palestine"" during the attack, it is alleged.

A total of 12 victims were injured and taken to hospitals, authorities said. One of those was at one point said to be in a critical condition.

A federal criminal complaint (court filing) said Soliman confessed to the attack, told investigators that he had planned it for a year, said he ""wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead"", and that ""he would do it again"".

At a press conference on Monday evening, 20th judicial district attorney Michael Dougherty said ""Boulder is a beautiful and special place, but we're not immune from mass violence or hate crimes"" as he explained the charges against Soliman.

He said that the suspect faces 16 counts of attempted murder in the first-degree, with eight of those for attempted murder with intent and after deliberation, meaning he had time to consider his crimes.

The other eight counts relate to attempted murder with extreme indifference, meaning he acted without regard to others' lives.

Soliman is also charged with eight counts of first-degree assault, two counts of use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

If convicted on all charges pursued by the state prosecutor, and if they run consecutively, Soliman faces a maximum sentence of 624 years in prison.

Mr Dougherty added that the US attorney's office ""will be prosecuting the hate crime against the defendant,"" which relates to the federal crime of causing bodily injury because of actual or perceived race, colour, religion, or national origin.

After the press conference, Soliman made his first appearance in court, appearing via web link from Boulder County Jail.

During the brief hearing, Judge Nancy Salomone asked the suspect if received the protection order issued by the court preventing him from contacting the victims, to which he said ""yes"".

She then said she will see legal representatives on Thursday for the filing of the charges.","Mohamed Soliman is in custody and has been charged with several counts of attempted murder, first-degree assault, and attempted use of an incendiary device."

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, told investigators that he wanted to ""kill all Zionist people"" but had delayed committing the attack in the city of Boulder until after his daughter had graduated from high school, according to state and federal court documents charging him with attempted murder, assault and a federal hate crime.

Police and FBI affidavits quoted the suspect as saying he had learned to shoot a gun in a class he took for the purpose of obtaining a concealed-carry permit but ended up using Molotov cocktails because of his immigration status. Soliman told investigators that he had learned how to make the fire bombs from YouTube.

Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Soliman had overstayed a tourist visa and had an expired work permit.

Trump administration officials immediately seized on Sunday's violence as an example of why they are cracking down on illegal immigration.

A police affidavit filed in support of Soliman's arrest warrant said he was born in Egypt, lived in Kuwait for 17 years and moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder, where he lived with his wife and five children.

""In light of yesterday’s horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X.

According to the Boulder police affidavit, Soliman had planned for a year to carry out the attack, which unfolded on the Pearl Street Mall, a popular pedestrian shopping district near the University of Colorado.

The victims, many of them elderly, were taking part in an event organized by Run for Their Lives, an organization devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized in the aftermath of Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel.

The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans linked to outrage over Israel's escalating military offensive in Gaza. It followed the fatal shooting of two Israel Embassy aides that took place outside Washington's Capital Jewish Museum last month.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the suspect would be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law for what was described as an ""antisemitic terror attack.""

Authorities said they found 16 gasoline-filled Molotov cocktails near where the suspect was detained.

The police also found a gasoline canister in his car parked nearby and a weed sprayer filled with gasoline at the scene. The federal affidavit references a video posted on social media during the attack showing Soliman ""shirtless, pacing back and forth while holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails.""

On Thursday, state wildlife managers made what they called the “very difficult” decision to kill a wolf that was preying on livestock on private land in Pitkin County, and which had previously been relocated from another county due to concerns around livestock depredations.

The lethal removal took place the evening of May 29 on an unidentified cattle ranch. It was the first time that officials with Colorado Parks and Wildlife have killed a wolf since the voter-led reintroduction effort began in 2023. It was not, however, the first time that CPW has dealt with this particular wolf, which was identified in an agency news release as gray wolf 2405 and a member of the Copper Creek Pack.

Officials explained that the young male wolf had met their definition of “chronic depredation” after being linked to four such events in an eight-day period. They said those events occurred even with non-lethal deterrence measures in place. They pointed to “clear and convincing evidence” that 2405 was responsible for three of the cows that were injured or killed on several different ranches in Pitkin County around Memorial Day weekend.

“The decision to take lethal management action was very difficult,” CPW director Jeff Davis said in a statement. “Our wildlife biologists constructed a timeline of recent events that shows the depredation behavior met the conditions for chronic depredation that were defined earlier this year. We have great respect for these animals and take the removal of a wolf very seriously.”



Davis went on to explain that the action was meant “to discourage [the] other pack members” from preying on livestock. He said the agency would continue to monitor the behavior of those remaining pack mates “to determine if behavior has changed,” but didn’t specify what management actions might be taken based on that behavior in the future.

It’s also unclear based on CPW’s timeline of events whether wolf 2405 was acting alone, or if other members of the pack were involved in the depredations as well. That timeline cites GPS collar data, which showed “some wolves from the Copper Creek Pack were in the area” where the depredations took place on May 24 and 25.

A CPW spokesperson did not give a specific answer when asked by OL whether this collar data might indicate that multiple wolves from the Copper Creek Pack were involved in the Pitkin County depredations in May. The spokesperson clarified that 2405 was “a member of a pack determined to have met the definition of chronic depredation” and said CPW would post a full report with more information soon.

“[This] is not something that we take lightly,” CPW wolf conservation program manager Eric Odell said in Friday’s news release. “Removal of animals early in the restoration process is a balance between managing populations of wolves, while also assisting landowners in resolving ongoing conflicts with wolves.”

CPW also noted in Friday’s announcement that it is currently monitoring four potential dens across the state, and that more pups will likely be born this spring. That should bring Colorado closer to its eventual goal of a self-sustaining gray wolf population, while at the same time giving wildlife managers more GPS-collared wolves to keep track of. There are currently 23 collared wolves roaming the state, and their movements are updated monthly in a map maintained by CPW.

In many ways, the Copper Creek Pack has embodied how complicated and contentious Colorado’s wolf restoration process has been. The pack was formed by two of the 10 wolves that were initially brought over from Oregon and released in Grand and Summit Counties back in December 2023. The mating pair established a den in Grand County that winter and gave birth to five pups the following spring.

Conflicts soon followed. Between April and July 2024, as wolf advocates celebrated the pack’s formation, CPW confirmed multiple livestock depredations by the pack’s two adult wolves. Ranchers in Grand County pleaded with both the state and the federal government to lethally remove the wolves, but their requests were denied. Although CPW’s policy director told commissioners at one point that the adult pair had caused “the main issues in depredation” among all the wolves that were relocated there from Oregon, the agency ultimately decided that killing the two breeding wolves would be “irresponsible” and could hamper its larger recovery goals.

CPW chose instead to capture and relocate the Copper Creek Pack in September. The male wolf died soon after capture, and one of the pups eluded officials, while the remaining four pups and the female were trapped and held at an undisclosed facility for several months. The five Copper Creek wolves were then re-released this last winter along with the 15 additional gray wolves that were translocated from British Columbia to Eagle and Pitkin Counties in January.

At the time of the Copper Creek Pack’s capture last fall, CPW acknowledged that relocation was not how it planned to handle those types of conflicts going forward. Ranchers, meanwhile, expressed their concerns that by relocating the wolves, wildlife managers were simply moving the problem instead of solving it.

“By refusing to manage problem wolves, CPW has allowed livestock depredations to continue unchecked, while fostering a pack of depredating wolves,” read an August 2024 letter from the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association to CPW director Jeff Davis. “Pups from these problem wolves will be trained to ‘hunt’ and survive off livestock.”","State wildlife managers say they made the ""very difficult decision"" to lethally remove the wolf, which had been relocated from another county in September 2024 due to evidence that its pack mates were preying on livestock"

One of the original ""Squad"" members who was elected in 2018, Rep.

In Boulder, Colorado, Mohamed Soliman allegedly targeted with Molotov cocktails those who were participating in a pro-Israel ""Run for Their Lives"" event. He is reportedly an illegal immigrant from Egypt who overstayed his visa. While many Democrats released statements--which were problematic in their own way, given how much the party is in disarray over supporting Israel--it took Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) a noticeably long time to put out his own. He is notably a top target of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) for the 2026 midterms.

Ossoff's official X account on Monday afternoon shared a statement, though that has yet to be shared with his political account. That account has not shared anything since a statement from the senator on May 22, in light of still another recent attack, this time when two Israeli embassy staff members were murdered outside of the Capital Jewish Museum.

""I condemn in the strongest terms this heinous attack on a Jewish community event in Colorado, and am praying for those who were injured,"" he began. ""This act of terrorism has shaken the Jewish community in Georgia and nationwide, but Jews refuse to be intimidated by cowardly antisemitic violence,"" Ossoff continued, despite how his party is in disarray over such an issue. ""I will sustain my efforts to fight antisemitism and remain committed to the safety oft the Jewish community in Georgia and nationwide. My office remains available at all times as a resource to Georgia organizations who require support from local, state, or Federal law enforcement.""

Ossoff's statement didn't receive much attention, in contrast to posts shared over X from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who was thoroughly ratioed. What replies did come in, however, noted how long it took and cast blame on the Democratic Party when it comes to antisemitism and illelgal immigration.

The NRSC certainly took notice, speaking out about what had at that point been the senator's silence in a post after X just after 8am this morning.

""Jon Ossoff is so desperate to appease the far-left, pro-Hamas radicals in his Party that he can't condemn an illegal alien that lit pro-Israel protesters on fire while screaming 'Free Palestine,'"" NRSC Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez also said in a statement. ""It's unacceptable and Georgia deserves better.""

Earlier on Monday, Ossoff's account also revealed that his wife had given birth to their second child. Although such a statement has been shared to his Senate website, the statement about the indeed ""Heinous Attack"" has yet to appear there.

While his statement spoke to how Ossoff ""will sustain my efforts to fight antisemitism and remain committed to the safety of the Jewish community in Georgia and nationwide,"" the senator has come under fire from the Jewish community in Georgia, which could lead to his undoing and losing out on a second term, as even The New York Times highlighted earlier this year, and as the NRSC reminded in the post above. Even his fellow Georgia Democrats have taken issue with his handling of antisemitism following the October 7, 2023 attack committed against Israel by Hamas.",

Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, who is charged with a federal hate crime as well as state charges of attempted murder, assault and use of an explosive device, made a brief appearance in court on Monday.

Officials say the Egyptian national targeted a group of pro-Israel protesters at an outdoor mall in Boulder and shouted ""Free Palestine"" as he threw incendiary devices, injuring eight of them.

At least 16 unlit Molotov cocktails were found nearby afterwards. Investigators say he targeted the group after finding them online.

It is the latest attack on members of America's Jewish community.

The weekly demonstration was organised by Run for Their Lives, which raises awareness about Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.

Officials say Mr Soliman threw two incendiary devices into the gathering at the Pearl Street Mall, with eight of the victims suffering burns.

Twelve people, including four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88, were taken to the hospital, with injuries ranging from minor to serious.

Officials previously said there were eight victims, but on Monday four more came forward with minor injuries.
• None What we know about the attack in Colorado

The eldest of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The attacked happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.

The suspect appeared in court on Monday via a video feed from the Boulder County Jail for less than five minutes, standing and wearing an orange jumpsuit.

He answered ""yes"" to some procedural questions from the judge, but otherwise did not speak. The court scheduled a date for the formal filing of charges this Thursday.

Officials said on Monday they believe he acted alone.

In an interview after his arrest, Mr Soliman told police he had been planning the attack for a year, to take place after his daughter's high school graduation, according to an arrest warrant affidavit from the FBI.

He told police he wanted to ""kill all Zionists"" and would carry out the attack again, the court documents stated.

In addition to the unlit Molotov cocktails, backpack weed sprayer containing octane gasoline was found nearby.

Mr Soliman dressed up as a gardener with an orange vest to get as close to the group of people as possible, according to police.

He said he had been watching YouTube videos on how to make Molotov cocktails, according to the affidavit.

Investigators say he told them he learned to fire a gun in hope of obtaining a concealed-carry permit, but ended up using Molotov cocktails because his immigration status prevented him from accessing firearms.

Mr Soliman drove from his home in Colorado Springs to Boulder, arriving five minutes before the group's meeting, according to court documents. He allegedly said he bought petrol on his way to the attack.

According to the FBI, throughout the interview, Mr Soliman said he hated Zionists and targeted them because they need to stop taking over ""our land"", which he said was a reference to the Palestinian territories.

Mr Soliman allegedly told officials he left his iPhone hidden in a desk drawer with messages to his family, wife and five children. His wife later brought the iPhone to officials, according to court documents.

Law enforcement officials said on Monday there was no previous indication that the defendant was a threat.

""We fully intended to hold Mr Soliman accountable for his actions, and these charges are the first step,"" Acting US Attorney for the District of Colorado J Bishop Grewell told a press conference on Monday.

Mr Soliman moved to Colorado Springs three years ago and previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources have told CBS News.

Homeland security officials said he filed for asylum a month after arriving, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved.

President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, said on X that Mr Soliman was given a work permit by the Biden administration after he had overstayed his visa.

""In light of yesterday's horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X.

Mr Soliman has been working as a food delivery driver for Uber since 2023, a company spokesperson told CBS.

According to the company, when he began working for them, he met all Uber requirements, including passing a criminal and driving history background check, providing a photo ID and holding a valid Social Security number.

Trump said in a social media post that attacks like the one Mr Soliman allegedly carried out would not be tolerated.

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he said.

The Jewish community in the US has faced a series of attacks during the war in Gaza.

Last month two Israel embassy aides were shot and killed outside Washington DC's Capital Jewish Museum. Investigators said the assailant shouted ""Free Palestine"".

In April, a suspect firebombed the residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish. Officials said they were considering hate crime charges.

The Israel-Gaza war began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas launched a cross-border attack, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.

At least 54,470 people have been killed since then in Gaza as a result of Israel's military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

The new image, as displayed on the White House’s social media channels, casts Mr Trump in a warmer light and softens his expression from his first portrait in a break from presidential tradition.

The other changes in the picture include swapping out a turquoise tie for his favoured red power tie, and changing the background – the US flag in what appears to be a state room – to black.

It is uncommon for a US president to change their portrait so soon into their term, but Mr Trump, a former reality TV star, is famously conscious of his appearance.

In his first portrait, published a few days before his inauguration in January, he appeared stony-faced, with his right eye narrowed and squinting, while his lips were pressed together tightly.

It drew comparisons to the mugshot released by authorities in Georgia after his arrest on racketeering charges in 2023.

The Republican is famously image-obsessed and reportedly practised how he would pose for the mugshot which was later released by Fulton County Sheriff’s Office.

He subsequently claimed it was the “number-one selling mugshot” in history which “beat Elvis” and “beat Frank Sintara”, and later installed it on a wall in the Oval Office after winning the presidential election last year. He appears to have been less enamoured of his official portrait, however.

It’s not the first time the president has sought to remove an unflattering portrait.

Colorado removed the portrait of Mr Trump hanging in its state capitol in March when the president complained about its appearance and called on Governor Jared Polis to “take it down”.

That painting was by Sarah Boardman, a British artist, who after being commissioned for the piece in 2018 described it as showing the president with a “serious, thoughtful, non-confontational” expression.

But Mr Trump called it “truly the worst”.

“Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado… was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

“The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst. She must have lost her talent as she got older.

“In any event, I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one, but many people from Colorado have called and written to complain. In fact, they are actually angry about it!”","Donald Trump has updated his official portrait just months after taking office, in an apparent bid to appear less menacing."

Israel Embassy. Yesterday morning, the same media ran with stories that Israel opened fire on Gazans waiting for aid. This was a lie, too, but that same day, a terrorist firebombed a pro-Israel walk in Boulder, Colorado, injuring several people.

But the media -- who never miss a chance to lecture us about 'stochastic terrorism' when the Right says something they don't like -- seem wholly disinterested in figuring out their role in all of this and they keep running inflammatory headlines.

Like this one from the AP:

'Health officials' means 'Hamas operatives' who know how to play the Western media like a fiddle.

An Israeli strike on a residential building in the Gaza Strip on Monday killed 14 people, mostly women and children, according to health officials. The Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals confirmed the toll from the strike in the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, saying five women and seven children were among those killed. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militant group is entrenched in populated areas.

Hamas does entrench in populated areas to use civilians as human shields, knowing full well the Left will defend them and blame Israel.

They are so disgusting.

Because then they couldn't bash Israel.

We do not believe them.

No one believes them.

That's what they want.

BOULDER, Colo. — A man armed with a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices launched a fiery attack on demonstrators in Colorado who were calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a “targeted terror attack.”

How did the attack unfold?

Authorities said the attacker targeted volunteers with Run for Their Lives, which organizes running and walking events to call for the immediate release of Israelis being held in Gaza. The hostages were captured by militants during an incursion into southern Israel in 2023 that precipitated the latest Israel-Hamas war.

The group gathered Sunday at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students. Witnesses said the suspect first used the flame thrower, then threw two Molotov cocktails into the crowd. Soliman was arrested at the scene.

Video from the scene shows a shirtless Soliman shouting at onlookers while holding two clear bottles containing a transparent liquid. Another video shows a witness shouting: “He’s right there. He’s throwing Molotov cocktails,” as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.

One witness, Alex Osante, said Soliman appeared to catch himself on fire during the attack. A booking photo shows him with a bandage over one of his ears. Police said he was taken to the hospital after he was arrested but haven’t described his injuries.

What was his motive?

He told investigators “he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” that he specifically targeted the Run for Their Lives group and that he had researched and planned the attack for more than a year, according to the affidavit.

“This act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.

The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington, D.C., by a man who yelled “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza” as he was led away by police.

He is charged federally with commission of a hate crime, which carries a sentence of life in prison when the charge includes attempted murder. Colorado state charges include 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of using an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.

Soliman was born in Egypt and he moved three years ago to Colorado Springs, where he lived with his wife and five children, according to state court documents. He previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

The Department of Homeland Security said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and has been living in the U.S. illegally since his visa expired in February 2023.",Twelve people were injured and the FBI described the violence as a “targeted terror attack.”

A suspect is in custody after investigators say he attacked eight people Sunday in Boulder with a makeshift flamethrower and shouted, “Free Palestine.”

The injured were demonstrating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages.

“The people in Boulder, Colorado were savagely attacked by a terrorist while they were expressing their First Amendment rights. that should never happen in this country,” said Bennet.

The FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism.

“After all, all they were doing was expressing a simple plea: bring the hostages home. And because of their Jewish identity, they were targeted by hate,” said Schumer.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman was in the country illegally.

The White House says President Trump stands with Jewish Americans and with its plans to deport illegal immigrants.

“This terrorist was allowed into this country by the previous administration who was foolishly given a tourism visa and then was illegally allowed to stay. These individuals are going to be deported, and we’re not going to tolerate such violence in our country,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

President Trump posted on Truth Social, “Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE,”

The attack comes just over a week after a man was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C.

“I’m extremely upset and frustrated that our community is continuously under attack,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, said in an interview.

He joined a statement issued by a half-dozen lawmakers as authorities charged Mohamed Sabry Soliman with a federal hate crime. The FBI said he shouted “Free Palestine” during the attack on marchers in a weekly event calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured after Soliman threw two lit Molotov cocktails and used a “makeshift flamethrower,” law enforcement officials said.

The lawmakers’ statement says the Jewish community is “strong and deeply rooted in our state’s history,” adding that some of the legislators have participated in past events organized by Run for Their Lives, which put together Sunday’s demonstration. It was also signed by five Democrats — Sens. Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City, Mike Weissman of Aurora and Matt Ball of Denver; and Reps. Emily Sirota and Steven Woodrow of Denver.

“As we mourn the victims of yesterday’s attack in Boulder, we ask our allies to speak out,” the lawmakers said. “Whether publicly or privately — and regardless of views on the conflict in the Middle East — we must confront hate forcefully, before it becomes normalized.

“The rising tide of antisemitic attacks doesn’t just threaten Jews. It threatens the very fabric of what makes America worth believing in. We should all be outraged to live in a country where this is happening — and determined to change it.”

The lawmakers referenced two other attacks: the fatal shooting of two staffers from the Israeli Embassy outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C., last month, and a fire set at the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion in April, apparently targeting Gov. Josh Shapiro.

“What (the targets) all had in common was that they were Jewish,” the lawmakers’ statement says of those incidents and the Boulder attack. “We have a name for this: antisemitism.”

Weinberg, in the interview, said he’s grieving for the people who were attacked in Boulder and will do what he can for the Jewish community across the state.

He also expressed frustration that the man suspected to be responsible was an Egyptian citizen living in Colorado illegally after overstaying his tourist visa. Weinberg is opposed to Colorado legislation aimed at protecting undocumented immigrants and urged people to pay attention in their elections.

Weinberg expressed worry that Sunday’s act would introduce fear back into Jewish communities across Colorado.

“We need to be outspoken about how wrong this stuff is,” Weinberg said.

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)

The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.

Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”

At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.

The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”

A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”

“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”

At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.

“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.

Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.

J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”

“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”

FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.

“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.

All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.

“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, who is charged with a federal hate crime as well as state charges of attempted murder, assault and use of an explosive device, made a brief appearance in court on Monday.

Officials say the Egyptian national targeted a group of pro-Israel protesters at an outdoor mall in Boulder and shouted ""Free Palestine"" as he threw incendiary devices, injuring eight of them.

At least 16 unlit Molotov cocktails were found nearby afterwards. Investigators say he targeted the group after finding them online.

It is the latest attack on members of America's Jewish community.

The weekly demonstration was organised by Run for Their Lives, which raises awareness about Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.

Officials say Mr Soliman threw two incendiary devices into the gathering at the Pearl Street Mall, with eight of the victims suffering burns.

Twelve people, including four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88, were taken to the hospital, with injuries ranging from minor to serious.

Officials previously said there were eight victims, but on Monday four more came forward with minor injuries.
• None What we know about the attack in Colorado

The eldest of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The attacked happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.

The suspect appeared in court on Monday via a video feed from the Boulder County Jail for less than five minutes, standing and wearing an orange jumpsuit.

He answered ""yes"" to some procedural questions from the judge, but otherwise did not speak. The court scheduled a date for the formal filing of charges this Thursday.

Officials said on Monday they believe he acted alone.

In an interview after his arrest, Mr Soliman told police he had been planning the attack for a year, to take place after his daughter's high school graduation, according to an arrest warrant affidavit from the FBI.

He told police he wanted to ""kill all Zionists"" and would carry out the attack again, the court documents stated.

In addition to the unlit Molotov cocktails, backpack weed sprayer containing octane gasoline was found nearby.

Mr Soliman dressed up as a gardener with an orange vest to get as close to the group of people as possible, according to police.

He said he had been watching YouTube videos on how to make Molotov cocktails, according to the affidavit.

Investigators say he told them he learned to fire a gun in hope of obtaining a concealed-carry permit, but ended up using Molotov cocktails because his immigration status prevented him from accessing firearms.

Mr Soliman drove from his home in Colorado Springs to Boulder, arriving five minutes before the group's meeting, according to court documents. He allegedly said he bought petrol on his way to the attack.

According to the FBI, throughout the interview, Mr Soliman said he hated Zionists and targeted them because they need to stop taking over ""our land"", which he said was a reference to the Palestinian territories.

Mr Soliman allegedly told officials he left his iPhone hidden in a desk drawer with messages to his family, wife and five children. His wife later brought the iPhone to officials, according to court documents.

Law enforcement officials said on Monday there was no previous indication that the defendant was a threat.

""We fully intended to hold Mr Soliman accountable for his actions, and these charges are the first step,"" Acting US Attorney for the District of Colorado J Bishop Grewell told a press conference on Monday.

Mr Soliman moved to Colorado Springs three years ago and previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources have told CBS News.

Homeland security officials said he filed for asylum a month after arriving, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved.

President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, said on X that Mr Soliman was given a work permit by the Biden administration after he had overstayed his visa.

""In light of yesterday's horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X.

Mr Soliman has been working as a food delivery driver for Uber since 2023, a company spokesperson told CBS.

According to the company, when he began working for them, he met all Uber requirements, including passing a criminal and driving history background check, providing a photo ID and holding a valid Social Security number.

Trump said in a social media post that attacks like the one Mr Soliman allegedly carried out would not be tolerated.

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he said.

The Jewish community in the US has faced a series of attacks during the war in Gaza.

Last month two Israel embassy aides were shot and killed outside Washington DC's Capital Jewish Museum. Investigators said the assailant shouted ""Free Palestine"".

In April, a suspect firebombed the residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish. Officials said they were considering hate crime charges.

The Israel-Gaza war began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas launched a cross-border attack, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.

At least 54,470 people have been killed since then in Gaza as a result of Israel's military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel Embassy. Yesterday morning, the same media ran with stories that Israel opened fire on Gazans waiting for aid. This was a lie, too, but that same day, a terrorist firebombed a pro-Israel walk in Boulder, Colorado, injuring several people.

But the media -- who never miss a chance to lecture us about 'stochastic terrorism' when the Right says something they don't like -- seem wholly disinterested in figuring out their role in all of this and they keep running inflammatory headlines.

Like this one from the AP:

'Health officials' means 'Hamas operatives' who know how to play the Western media like a fiddle.

An Israeli strike on a residential building in the Gaza Strip on Monday killed 14 people, mostly women and children, according to health officials. The Shifa and al-Ahli hospitals confirmed the toll from the strike in the built-up Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, saying five women and seven children were among those killed. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militant group is entrenched in populated areas.

Hamas does entrench in populated areas to use civilians as human shields, knowing full well the Left will defend them and blame Israel.

They are so disgusting.

Because then they couldn't bash Israel.

We do not believe them.

No one believes them.

That's what they want.

A suspect is in custody after investigators say he attacked eight people Sunday in Boulder with a makeshift flamethrower and shouted, “Free Palestine.”

The injured were demonstrating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages.

“The people in Boulder, Colorado were savagely attacked by a terrorist while they were expressing their First Amendment rights. that should never happen in this country,” said Bennet.

The FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism.

“After all, all they were doing was expressing a simple plea: bring the hostages home. And because of their Jewish identity, they were targeted by hate,” said Schumer.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman was in the country illegally.

The White House says President Trump stands with Jewish Americans and with its plans to deport illegal immigrants.

“This terrorist was allowed into this country by the previous administration who was foolishly given a tourism visa and then was illegally allowed to stay. These individuals are going to be deported, and we’re not going to tolerate such violence in our country,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

President Trump posted on Truth Social, “Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE,”

The attack comes just over a week after a man was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C.

Mohammed Sabry Soliman is alleged to have thrown fire bombs and sprayed burning gasoline at a group of people who had gathered on Sunday in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Twelve people were hurt in the attack in the city of Boulder, police said, two of them seriously. Most of those taken to the hospital have now been discharged.

J. Bishop Grewell, acting US Attorney for the District of Colorado, told reporters the 45-year-old suspect had been planning the attack for a year.

Soliman threw ""Molotov cocktails at a group of men and women, some of them in their late 80s, burning them as they peacefully walked on a Sunday to draw attention to Israeli hostages held in Gaza,"" he said.

""When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die. He had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again.""

Soliman told investigators he had previously tried to buy a gun, but had been thwarted because he was not a US citizen.

Police who rushed to the scene of the attack found 16 unused Molotov cocktails and a backpack weed sprayer containing gasoline that investigators say he had intended to use as a makeshift flamethrower.

Soliman faces federal hate crime charges that could result in a life sentence, as well as state charges for attempted murder that could carry hundreds of years prison time.

US Homeland Security officials said Soliman was in the country illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.

Trump lashed out at his predecessor, Joe Biden, over the incident.

""Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,"" Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a ""terrible tragedy.""

He blamed ""Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy"" for allowing Soliman into the country.

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he wrote.

His Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, vowed to hunt down people who wreak havoc.

""All terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump Administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" he wrote on social media.

The attack occurred on Sunday afternoon during a regular demonstration in support of hostages taken in the assault on Israel by Hamas gunmen on October 7, 2023.

In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

In another video, a police officer rushes to arrest the same man, who is lying on the grass. Several people are milling around nearby.

Witness Brian Horowitz told CNN he had rushed towards the scene to see if he could help.

""The attacker was yelling things like: 'You effing Zionists. Kill my people. I kill you' at 20 different people,"" he said.

""He was saying: 'You're a killer. You're a killer,' making eye contact with me, telling me that I was a killer and he'll kill us.""

Sunday's attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.

It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted ""Free Palestine,"" was arrested.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said.","The man suspected of a Molotov cocktail attack on Jewish protesters in Colorado is facing federal hate crime charges, officials said Monday, as President Donald Trump's administration vowed to pursue"

“Our focus right now is on the families, the victims, the people who witnessed this atrocity, and making sure that we are in community supporting them and supporting each other,” said Jonathan Lev, the executive director of the Boulder Jewish Community Center.

Lev said the Boulder Jewish Community Center is working with other Jewish leaders in Boulder to provide support to each of the families. Support and resources are being provided on an individual basis, Lev said. The organization is also working with law enforcement and is fully focused on the safety and security of the Jewish community at this time.

“The challenge we face right now is how rhetoric can escalate to the point that violence becomes OK,” Lev said. “That is not an OK way to operate as a society, as a people. And what we’ve seen locally and what we’ve seen on a national and international level regarding Jewish hate and antisemitism … that fosters an environment that makes it unsafe to be Jewish. It creates an environment where violence becomes part of the norm.”

Twelve people suffered burns and other injuries on Sunday after a man attacked them on Pearl Street in Boulder with what officials called a “makeshift flamethrower” and an incendiary device.

The attack happened at 1:26 p.m. Sunday outside of the Boulder County Courthouse during a weekly walk organized by the city’s chapter of Run for Their Lives, which calls for the release of hostages held by the terrorist group Hamas.

Lev said the Boulder Jewish Community Center is working on a gathering for the community.

“We know how important it is to come together to support one another and connect with one another to make sure that the message these people had is able to be transmitted to everyone,” he said.

That message, Lev said, is that the Run for Their Lives walk is a peaceful, non-political walk to highlight the fact that there are still hostages in Gaza.

“These are the most peaceful, loving, humanitarian people you can possibly imagine who have dedicated their lives to this kind of work,” Lev said.

Police have arrested a 45-year-old man, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, on suspicion of eight felonies, including attempted first-degree murder and first-degree assault. Soliman, who federal officials said was living in Colorado illegally, has been charged with a federal hate crime, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest affidavit.

None of the victims had died as of Monday morning, according to police.

“There are no words to describe this that would be an appropriate encapsulation of the devastation, the horror, the fear, the outrage that we’re all feeling right now in response to this attack,” said Shara Smith, the CEO of the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado.

The Interfaith Alliance of Colorado is a public policy and advocacy organization that joins together and represents more than 400 congregations and two dozen faith traditions statewide. Smith said she’s hearing from the Jewish members of their community about feelings of devastation, hurt, fear and outrage.

“There’s also a sense of wondering in terms of whether or not people will understand the impact this has on the Jewish community. It’s really important to us as an interfaith organization that we take this as an attack on all of us and not just one community, because ultimately we are one family,” Smith said. ” … What I’m hearing from our Jewish brothers and sisters in this moment is a desire to be seen as human beings, and we want them to know that we see them.

“We see you, we love you and we know this is horrible. We are not going to sit quietly while our Jewish brothers and sisters are attacked and we won’t sit quietly when anyone at our family table is attacked. We will always speak up.”

The Boulder Jewish Community Center has its 30th Boulder Jewish Festival scheduled for 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday on Pearl Street. If held as planned, the festival would take place in the same place as the attack, exactly a week later.

Lev said the Jewish Community Center will share with the community what will happen regarding the event. No decisions have yet been made.

“We’re looking at it and seeing what might be possible and what might be right at this challenging time for our community,” Lev said.

Lev said the Boulder Jewish Festival is one of the longest continually existing Jewish festivals in the country.

“The Boulder Jewish Festival is a really important day for the Boulder community,” Lev said.

Boulder has one of the largest Jewish communities in the country per capita, Lev said. There are more than 19,000 Jewish households with more than 35,000 people in them in Boulder County, Lev said, citing a study from 2018.

He said the Jewish community in Boulder is vibrant, with many synagogues and community gatherings and activities.

“It has become a beacon for what Jewish life can look like throughout the country,” he said.

University of Colorado Boulder student Gil Eskayo and Boulder residents Caleb Loewengart and Maya Winkler visited the site of the attack on Monday wearing Jewish clothes, jewelry and imagery.

“Yesterday I was very shocked and upset and frustrated (as) more news was coming out,” Winkler said. “Today, I’m more of, ‘Ok, how can I turn this darkness into light?’”

To Eskayo, who recently returned from a trip to Israel, the attack was representative of a larger wave of anti-Semitic attacks.

“To speak for a lot of the people in Israel, we don’t want the fighting. We’re asking our government to stop. We want the hostages to come home, bodies to come back to their families. We want it to end, and we don’t want people to kill us anymore,” Eskayo said. “Wars are fought between nations, not people … I have no problem with anyone who’s Muslim or Arab, I love them.

“I went and hung out with one of my Muslim friends right after this event yesterday and we just connected with each other because we’re both people. We’re not fighting each other.”

Loewengart and Winkler haven’t felt too unsafe as Jewish people in Boulder. There are days when Winkler hides her Star of David necklace, and there are others when she proudly shows it off, she said. Sunday was the first time that Loewengart, a Centaurus High School graduate and lifelong area resident, felt unsafe to be Jewish in the community.

“I do think that people who live in Boulder are loving, caring people and (I) really, really do think that, as a community, coming out of this we’ll only be stronger,” said Loewengart, who thinks that there isn’t enough of a conversation on the remaining hostages and how antisemitism can hit close to home. “I think this was an incident where a lot of non-Jewish people really realized how much of a present threat it is, and why Jewish people have been so vigilant over the past two years.”

‘It’s time for everybody to speak up’

Stefanie Clarke, the co-executive director of Stop Antisemitism Colorado, said the attack is part of a larger trend. She referenced the incident where a gunman killed two Israeli embassy employees in Washington. Locally, people protesting the Israel-Hamas conflict have continuously disrupted Boulder City Council meetings. At CU Boulder, police investigated anti-Semitic graffiti sprayed on several campus buildings, and the Jewish community on campus felt unsafe after a statement of support for Palestine was made by the Ethnic Studies Department.

“We have been trying to sound the alarm for months and months, since Oct 7, (2023), and it’s time to put an end to this dangerous rhetoric, and it’s time for the Boulder community to come together with the Jewish people,” Clarke said. “It’s time for everybody to speak up and condemn this unequivocally.”

She added that this kind of event could happen anywhere, and it will continue to happen unless people do something about it.

“The thought of Jews being lit on fire in the middle of Pearl Street is one of the most shockingly outrageous things that I can imagine,” Clarke said.

Smith, the CEO of Interfaith Alliance of Colorado, said it’s never OK for anyone to “use our streets and community” as a place to target people and carry out their vengeance for a political agenda.

“In every sense of the word this is horrific and this is devastating, but we are also determined to step forward in this moment and remind everyone of our shared humanity and remind folks not to give in to voices of division that are screaming loudly now and in the days to come,” Smith said.

Moving forward, Smith said, it will be critical to see each other’s humanity, deepen understanding of one another and engage in dialogue.

“Compassion requires courage. Dialogue requires courage. Violence does not,” Smith said. “ … We are not going to allow anyone’s hatred to divide us, and that is the most important thing to keep in mind in this moment.”

Lev said he’s especially grateful to the first responders for their compassion when helping the victims of the attack. He added that there has been an outpouring of support from Boulder community members, organizations and elected officials locally and statewide.

He hopes all organizations and people locally will not just condemn the attack but take action, like by calling out hate speech on an individual level in day-to-day life.

“In that solidarity, we want people to condemn antisemitism to stop and help us stop the rhetoric that happens here in our community, so we can live in a way that this Jewish community and all Jewish communities around the world can be vibrant and thriving versus being threatened,” Lev said.",People in the Jewish community in Boulder and throughout the state respond to Sunday’s attack on Pearl Street.

A suspect is in custody after investigators say he attacked eight people Sunday in Boulder with a makeshift flamethrower and shouted, “Free Palestine.”

The injured were demonstrating for Hamas to release Israeli hostages.

“The people in Boulder, Colorado were savagely attacked by a terrorist while they were expressing their First Amendment rights. that should never happen in this country,” said Bennet.

The FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism.

“After all, all they were doing was expressing a simple plea: bring the hostages home. And because of their Jewish identity, they were targeted by hate,” said Schumer.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman was in the country illegally.

The White House says President Trump stands with Jewish Americans and with its plans to deport illegal immigrants.

“This terrorist was allowed into this country by the previous administration who was foolishly given a tourism visa and then was illegally allowed to stay. These individuals are going to be deported, and we’re not going to tolerate such violence in our country,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

President Trump posted on Truth Social, “Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE,”

The attack comes just over a week after a man was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C.

Or is Lindell being unfairly targeted by Eric Coomer, a man he says he didn't even know?

Jury selection marked the first day of the former Trump insider's two-week defamation trial in Denver U.S. District Court at the Alfred A. Arraj United States Courthouse. Opening statements are expected to start Tuesday.

Five men and three women were chosen from the original jury pool of 52, who were asked questions regarding their opinions of President Donald Trump, whether they thought ""January sixers"" were patriots or criminals, and whether they own a My Pillow.

Lindell, his company, My Pillow Inc., and FrankSpeech LLC, now known as Lindell TV, are being sued for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy by Coomer, who was the director of product strategy and security for Dominion Voting Systems during the 2020 election.

Dominion is one of the largest providers of voting machines and software in the United States.

Coomer, a Colorado resident, has accused the staunch MAGA supporter of spreading conspiracy theories by falsely claiming Dominion rigged the 2020 election and claiming that Coomer “should be jailed for treason,” according to court documents.

In a motion filed in late April, Coomer said that Lindell’s comments ruined his career and his life.

He has filed a series of lawsuits against conservative figures alleging the same basic sequence of events. Coomer's claims originated with a November 2020 podcast recorded by Joe Oltmann. The Denver proceeding is the only one of Coomer’s lawsuits to go to trial.

Days after the presidential election, Oltmann alleged he had recently listened in on an ""antifa"" conference call — a reference to anti-fascist ideology.

On the call, an unnamed participant referenced ""Eric ... the Dominion guy."" Oltmann alleged ""Eric"" said, ""Don't worry about the election, (Donald) Trump is not gonna win. I made f-ing sure of that.”

Oltmann then conducted his own ""investigation"" by Googling the terms ""Eric,"" ""Dominion,"" and ""Colorado."" Based on limited other information found online, he concluded Coomer was the one who allegedly made comments about election rigging. Oltmann repeated his story publicly, even after the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency found ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”

Oltmann has been subpoenaed to testify in Lindell’s trial, but Coomer’s attorneys told the judge that as of Monday, he had failed to show up for court.

Lindell, in a dark suit and glasses with a lapel in the shape of a silver cross, sat quietly with his attorneys.

On Monday morning, at least two dozen supporters, carrying signs and American flags, cheered and lined up to shake his hand.

Not everyone was complimentary of the man who still sells pillows, sheets and crosses on his website. One woman confronted him face-to-face on the courthouse steps and called him a fascist.

Lindell to take the stand

Lindell told The Denver Gazette that he intends to testify that he did not defame Coomer. “When you talk about defamation there’s only one truth, and that is, I didn’t even know the guy,” he said.

Lindell often characterizes himself as a “former crackhead” who lived the American dream when he built the multi-million-dollar MyPillow company from nothing. He stated during recent court proceedings that he has been financially devastated by lawsuits.

U.S. District Judge Nina Wang asked jurors whether any of them or a close family member donated or volunteered for any candidate or organization in conjunction with the 2020 election. She also asked if any of them had previously purchased MyPillow products.

During voir dire, one juror told Coomer’s attorney, David Beller, that her entire family has bought pillows from Lindell and that she is “a fan.”

Another responded, “I do enjoy the MyPillow,” but did not have any opinion of Lindell as a politician.”

When asked by Beller, none of the jurors believed that the 2020 election was rigged in favor of President Joe Biden.

Two of them were dismissed when they admitted that they could not put aside their personal feelings about Lindell’s conservative politics, which one juror described as “offensive.”

Numerous Lindell supporters filled the right side of the courtroom, stating that they plan to attend most days of the trial. One woman said she drove from Naples, Florida, to watch the proceedings, which Lindell calls ""The Trial of the Century.""

“He’s a warrior. He’s a hero and he won’t give up,” his wife, Kendra Lindell, said.

Coomer will be the first witness to testify. Lindell and Conservative Daily podcaster Oltmann are also expected to be key witnesses during what promises to be a contentious two weeks of testimony.

The witness list is a who’s who of Colorado election officials, including embattled former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, Executive Director of the Colorado County Clerk’s Association Matt Crane and former Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams, according to court documents filed in April.","MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell's defamation trial begins in Denver, with claims that he defamed Dominion Voting Systems employee Eric Coomer."

Mohammed Sabry Soliman, 45, who is charged with a federal hate crime as well as state charges of attempted murder, assault and use of an explosive device, made a brief appearance in court on Monday.

Officials say the Egyptian national targeted a group of pro-Israel protesters at an outdoor mall in Boulder and shouted ""Free Palestine"" as he threw incendiary devices, injuring eight of them.

At least 16 unlit Molotov cocktails were found nearby afterwards. Investigators say he targeted the group after finding them online.

It is the latest attack on members of America's Jewish community.

The weekly demonstration was organised by Run for Their Lives, which raises awareness about Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.

Officials say Mr Soliman threw two incendiary devices into the gathering at the Pearl Street Mall, with eight of the victims suffering burns.

Twelve people, including four men and four women between the ages of 52 and 88, were taken to the hospital, with injuries ranging from minor to serious.

Officials previously said there were eight victims, but on Monday four more came forward with minor injuries.
• None What we know about the attack in Colorado

The eldest of the victims is a Holocaust survivor, Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder, told the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The attacked happened on the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.

The suspect appeared in court on Monday via a video feed from the Boulder County Jail for less than five minutes, standing and wearing an orange jumpsuit.

He answered ""yes"" to some procedural questions from the judge, but otherwise did not speak. The court scheduled a date for the formal filing of charges this Thursday.

Officials said on Monday they believe he acted alone.

In an interview after his arrest, Mr Soliman told police he had been planning the attack for a year, to take place after his daughter's high school graduation, according to an arrest warrant affidavit from the FBI.

He told police he wanted to ""kill all Zionists"" and would carry out the attack again, the court documents stated.

In addition to the unlit Molotov cocktails, backpack weed sprayer containing octane gasoline was found nearby.

Mr Soliman dressed up as a gardener with an orange vest to get as close to the group of people as possible, according to police.

He said he had been watching YouTube videos on how to make Molotov cocktails, according to the affidavit.

Investigators say he told them he learned to fire a gun in hope of obtaining a concealed-carry permit, but ended up using Molotov cocktails because his immigration status prevented him from accessing firearms.

Mr Soliman drove from his home in Colorado Springs to Boulder, arriving five minutes before the group's meeting, according to court documents. He allegedly said he bought petrol on his way to the attack.

According to the FBI, throughout the interview, Mr Soliman said he hated Zionists and targeted them because they need to stop taking over ""our land"", which he said was a reference to the Palestinian territories.

Mr Soliman allegedly told officials he left his iPhone hidden in a desk drawer with messages to his family, wife and five children. His wife later brought the iPhone to officials, according to court documents.

Law enforcement officials said on Monday there was no previous indication that the defendant was a threat.

""We fully intended to hold Mr Soliman accountable for his actions, and these charges are the first step,"" Acting US Attorney for the District of Colorado J Bishop Grewell told a press conference on Monday.

Mr Soliman moved to Colorado Springs three years ago and previously spent 17 years living in Kuwait.

In 2022, Mr Soliman arrived in California on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023, multiple sources have told CBS News.

Homeland security officials said he filed for asylum a month after arriving, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved.

President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, said on X that Mr Soliman was given a work permit by the Biden administration after he had overstayed his visa.

""In light of yesterday's horrific attack, all terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X.

Mr Soliman has been working as a food delivery driver for Uber since 2023, a company spokesperson told CBS.

According to the company, when he began working for them, he met all Uber requirements, including passing a criminal and driving history background check, providing a photo ID and holding a valid Social Security number.

Trump said in a social media post that attacks like the one Mr Soliman allegedly carried out would not be tolerated.

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he said.

The Jewish community in the US has faced a series of attacks during the war in Gaza.

Last month two Israel embassy aides were shot and killed outside Washington DC's Capital Jewish Museum. Investigators said the assailant shouted ""Free Palestine"".

In April, a suspect firebombed the residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish. Officials said they were considering hate crime charges.

The Israel-Gaza war began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas launched a cross-border attack, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.

At least 54,470 people have been killed since then in Gaza as a result of Israel's military campaign, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

“I’m extremely upset and frustrated that our community is continuously under attack,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, said in an interview.

He joined a statement issued by a half-dozen lawmakers as authorities charged Mohamed Sabry Soliman with a federal hate crime. The FBI said he shouted “Free Palestine” during the attack on marchers in a weekly event calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Twelve people were injured after Soliman threw two lit Molotov cocktails and used a “makeshift flamethrower,” law enforcement officials said.

The lawmakers’ statement says the Jewish community is “strong and deeply rooted in our state’s history,” adding that some of the legislators have participated in past events organized by Run for Their Lives, which put together Sunday’s demonstration. It was also signed by five Democrats — Sens. Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City, Mike Weissman of Aurora and Matt Ball of Denver; and Reps. Emily Sirota and Steven Woodrow of Denver.

“As we mourn the victims of yesterday’s attack in Boulder, we ask our allies to speak out,” the lawmakers said. “Whether publicly or privately — and regardless of views on the conflict in the Middle East — we must confront hate forcefully, before it becomes normalized.

“The rising tide of antisemitic attacks doesn’t just threaten Jews. It threatens the very fabric of what makes America worth believing in. We should all be outraged to live in a country where this is happening — and determined to change it.”

The lawmakers referenced two other attacks: the fatal shooting of two staffers from the Israeli Embassy outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C., last month, and a fire set at the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion in April, apparently targeting Gov. Josh Shapiro.

“What (the targets) all had in common was that they were Jewish,” the lawmakers’ statement says of those incidents and the Boulder attack. “We have a name for this: antisemitism.”

Weinberg, in the interview, said he’s grieving for the people who were attacked in Boulder and will do what he can for the Jewish community across the state.

He also expressed frustration that the man suspected to be responsible was an Egyptian citizen living in Colorado illegally after overstaying his tourist visa. Weinberg is opposed to Colorado legislation aimed at protecting undocumented immigrants and urged people to pay attention in their elections.

Weinberg expressed worry that Sunday’s act would introduce fear back into Jewish communities across Colorado.

“We need to be outspoken about how wrong this stuff is,” Weinberg said.

(Screenshot from City of Boulder livestream)

The man suspected of attacking a group of demonstrators with incendiary devices in Boulder on Sunday, leaving multiple people hospitalized with severe injuries, faces state and federal charges for attempted murder and a hate crime, law enforcement officials announced.

Officials said the total number of victims in the attack had risen to 12, at least some of whom were participants in the Boulder branch of Run For Their Lives, which organizes events calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. They suffered burns from Molotov cocktails and what FBI officials described as a “makeshift flamethrower.”

At least two victims remained hospitalized as of Monday afternoon, Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said.

The suspect, 45-year-old Mohammed Sabry Soliman, was arrested by Boulder police and later told investigators that he targeted what he called a “Zionist group” after learning about it through an online search, according to an FBI affidavit filed Monday. Officials previously reported that Soliman, a Colorado Springs resident, was heard to shout “Free Palestine” during the attack.

“He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,” the FBI wrote of the suspect’s interview after his arrest. “He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year.”

A criminal complaint filed in federal court charges Soliman with one count of “a hate crime offense involving the actual or perceived race, religion, or national origin.”

“No American should experience violence motivated by hatred based on their faith or national origin, and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will act swiftly and decisively to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “There can be zero tolerance for such acts in our great nation.”

At a press conference later Monday, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said his office had charged the suspect with 16 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, two counts of the use of an incendiary device, and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device. A judge has set a $10 million cash bond on the state charges. Soliman made a brief appearance in Boulder County court on Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to return for a formal filing of charges on Thursday.

“Our office and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will be working closely together and in coordination with one another to ensure that the defendant is held fully accountable,” Dougherty said.

Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said Monday that Soliman was in the U.S. unlawfully, having entered the country in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023. An Egyptian national, he filed an asylum claim in September 2022, McLaughlin said.

J. Bishop Grewell, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, said additional federal charges could be forthcoming. In a press release Monday, the Department of Justice called the incident an “anti-Semitic terrorist attack.”

“We’ve moved to charge quickly, to send the message to the community that no acts of anti-Semitism are going to be tolerated,” Grewell told reporters. “Just because there’s only one charge that has been made so far doesn’t mean that we’re not considering other charges that could come in the future.”

FBI agents worked through the night to gather evidence at the scene and execute a search warrant at the suspect’s Colorado Springs residence, said Mark D. Michalek, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Denver field office. The suspect was not previously known to the FBI’s local Joint Terrorism Task Force, Michalek said.

“While at this time it appears the perpetrator acted alone, we do continue to investigate all possibilities and pursue all investigative leads,” he added.

All evacuations and closures in downtown Boulder had been lifted as of early Monday morning, Redfearn said.

“This morning, I walked down Pearl Street with members of my team. I interacted with a lot of business owners community out there, and the way I felt leaving there was I was heartened,” said Redfearn. “I was heartened by the resilience of our community. … Once again, as a community, we’re going to recover after coming together.”

“The people in Boulder, Colorado were savagely attacked by a terrorist while they were expressing their First Amendment rights. that should never happen in this country,” said Bennet.

“After all, all they were doing was expressing a simple plea: bring the hostages home. And because of their Jewish identity, they were targeted by hate,” said Schumer.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Soliman was in the country illegally.

The White House says President Trump stands with Jewish Americans and with its plans to deport illegal immigrants.

“This terrorist was allowed into this country by the previous administration who was foolishly given a tourism visa and then was illegally allowed to stay. These individuals are going to be deported, and we’re not going to tolerate such violence in our country,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

President Trump posted on Truth Social, “Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE,”

The attack comes just over a week after a man was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C.

“This terrorist was allowed into this country by the previous administration who was foolishly given a tourism visa and then was illegally allowed to stay. These individuals are going to be deported, and we’re not going to tolerate such violence in our country,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

President Trump posted on Truth Social, “Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE,”

The attack comes just over a week after a man was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C.

Mohammed Sabry Soliman is alleged to have thrown fire bombs and sprayed burning gasoline at a group of people who had gathered on Sunday in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

Twelve people were hurt in the attack in the city of Boulder, police said, two of them seriously. Most of those taken to the hospital have now been discharged.

J. Bishop Grewell, acting US Attorney for the District of Colorado, told reporters the 45-year-old suspect had been planning the attack for a year.

Soliman threw ""Molotov cocktails at a group of men and women, some of them in their late 80s, burning them as they peacefully walked on a Sunday to draw attention to Israeli hostages held in Gaza,"" he said.

""When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die. He had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again.""

Soliman told investigators he had previously tried to buy a gun, but had been thwarted because he was not a US citizen.

Police who rushed to the scene of the attack found 16 unused Molotov cocktails and a backpack weed sprayer containing gasoline that investigators say he had intended to use as a makeshift flamethrower.

Soliman faces federal hate crime charges that could result in a life sentence, as well as state charges for attempted murder that could carry hundreds of years prison time.

US Homeland Security officials said Soliman was in the country illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.

Trump lashed out at his predecessor, Joe Biden, over the incident.

""Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,"" Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a ""terrible tragedy.""

He blamed ""Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy"" for allowing Soliman into the country.

""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he wrote.

His Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, vowed to hunt down people who wreak havoc.

""All terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump Administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,"" he wrote on social media.

The attack occurred on Sunday afternoon during a regular demonstration in support of hostages taken in the assault on Israel by Hamas gunmen on October 7, 2023.

In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.

He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.

In another video, a police officer rushes to arrest the same man, who is lying on the grass. Several people are milling around nearby.

Witness Brian Horowitz told CNN he had rushed towards the scene to see if he could help.

""The attacker was yelling things like: 'You effing Zionists. Kill my people. I kill you' at 20 different people,"" he said.

""He was saying: 'You're a killer. You're a killer,' making eye contact with me, telling me that I was a killer and he'll kill us.""

Sunday's attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.

It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted ""Free Palestine,"" was arrested.

""Terrorism against Jews does not stop at the Gaza border -- it is already burning the streets of America,"" he said.","The man suspected of a Molotov cocktail attack on Jewish protesters in Colorado is facing federal hate crime charges, officials said Monday, as President Donald Trump's administration vowed to pursue"

Jared Polis on Monday signed a bill implementing a voter-approved ballot measure that allocates $350 million in state funding for law enforcement training, recruitment, and retention, along with a $1 million death benefit for the families of fallen officers.

Senate Bill 310, sponsored by Sens. Jeff Bridges, D-Greenwood Village, Barbara Kirkmeyer, R-Brighton, and Reps. Shannon Bird, D-Westminster, and Rick Taggart, R-Grand Junction, implemented Proposition 130, directing the state to invest $350 million to help recruit, train, and retain local law enforcement officers. The measure also requires the state to provide a $1 million one-time death benefit for the families of Colorado law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The proposition passed with just over 53% of the vote during the 2024 election.

""Colorado voters made it clear with Proposition 130 that they want real investments in public safety,"" said Bridges. ""This bill delivers on that promise by responsibly investing in law enforcement recruitment, retention, and training over the next several years. Even in a tough budget year, made worse by federal chaos and uncertainty, Colorado’s budget reflects our commitment to public education, public health, and public safety.""

Due to budgetary constraints, the $350 million will not be provided all at once. Senate Bill 130 establishes a ""Peace Officer Training and Support Fund."" It directs the state treasurer to issue a one-time warrant from the general fund reserve for $500 million, which will be allocated to the Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA).

The SB 310 bill also reduces the amount the General Assembly pays into PERA each year from $225 million to $190 million. The reduction will not impact PERA, as it will continue to earn investment income and interest of at least that amount every year from the $500 million transfer from the treasurer.

This will continue until the entire $350 million has been paid, for a minimum of 10 years.

The bill prohibits the general fund reserve from dipping below $1 billion, including in future years. The general fund reserve is expected to end the 2024-25 fiscal year at approximately $2.2 billion.

Implementing Prop. 130 was a top priority for Gov. Jared Polis. During his State of the State address at the beginning of the legislative session, he said he wanted the widow of Officer Evan Dunn, a Golden police officer who was killed on the job just days after the election, to receive a death benefit even though Dunn was dead before the measure was implemented.

""This law honors voter intent when they passed Prop 130 and increases the state’s investment in public safety,"" said Bird. ""Our law will invest $350 million to recruit, retain, and train local law enforcement officers and ensure that families of first responders receive death benefits in the event their family member’s life is taken while in the line of duty. Our law ensures that the state is a partner in protecting the safety of every Coloradan and makes certain that local law enforcement agencies have the resources they need to do their jobs well.""","Gov. Jared Polis signs bill to provide $350 million for law enforcement training, recruitment, and retention, as well as a $1 million death benefit."
