Charlottesville, known as a progressive college town, is bracing for another white nationalist rally scheduled for Saturday.

Police anticipate as many as 2,000 to 6,000 people, including counterprotesters, to converge in the Virginia city, in an event that could be “the largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States,” as described by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

So how did Charlottesville, which previously has been of little interest to white nationalists, become the rallying ground for what appears to be the third such event in the city this year?

Saturday’s “Unite the Right” event would bring white nationalists, neo-Confederates and alt-right activists to the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee at Emancipation Park, which had recently been renamed from Lee Park.

The same park was the site of a May demonstration in which a group carried torches led by white nationalist Richard Spencer around the Lee statue to protest its removal.

In July, a Ku Klux Klan rally in Charlottesville drew about 50 Klan members and supporters who gathered around a statue of Confederate Lt. Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson.

The historic city, home of Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia, has become the latest Southern battleground over the contested removal of Confederate monuments.

Like many cities, Charlottesville has grappled with what to do with its Confederate monuments — symbols of the Civil War that represent heritage to some, hate to others.

In April, the city council voted to remove the bronze statue of Lee, CNN affiliate WVIR reported. It was one of several steps Charlottesville is taking to reduce its Confederate monuments. The removal is on hold pending litigation.

The city became an ideal protest site for white nationalists.

“This entire community is a very far left community that has absorbed these cultural Marxist principles advocated in college towns across the country, about blaming white people for everything,” said Jason Kessler, who organized the “Unite the Right” rally.

Kessler, a Charlottesville resident, blames what he calls “the anti-white hatred that’s coming out of the city.”

Although other cities such as New Orleans, St. Louis and Austin have contended with the Confederate monuments issue, it is Charlottesville where the rallies are happening.

“Charlottesville has kind of been put on the map recently,” Mayor Mike Signer said last month. “We want to change the narrative by telling the true story of race through public spaces. That has made us a target for groups that hate that change and want to stay in the past, but we will not be intimidated.”

Outraged by the decision to remove the Lee statue, protesters in May converged around the monument carrying torches led by Spencer, who had returned to his college town. He is a graduate of the University of Virginia and lives in the state.

The gathering was swiftly condemned by city leaders, including Signer, who said it was “either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instill fear in our minority populations in a way that harkens back to the days of the KKK.”

But the fiery imagery from that event had a searing effect.

“Obviously that first event kickstarted public interest,” he said.

The torch light rally was well-received by extremists, said Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups and extremists.

“They love what they consider to be a powerful image. A lot of people pointed out that it looked like Klan harassing black people. They didn’t have a problem with that.”

“It’s partly because that went so well, that’s why they keep returning to Charlottesville,” Beirich added.

Two months later, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally at another Charlottesville park, which had been renamed Justice Park from Stonewall Jackson Park.

Clad in Klan robes and carrying Confederate flags, members of the North Carolina-based Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan marched to the park and chanted “white power.”

They were met with about 1,000 counterprotesters. The local chapter of the NAACP organized a counter-rally. Shouting “racists go home,” the crowd drowned out the Klansmen’s chants.

Kessler: ‘We’re going to have bigger events’

The previous two rallies were “seen as an affront to the liberal population of this city and of the country,” Kessler said.

The events “reopened the wound. It stuck a finger on the raw nerve of this population that has already failed to get over the election of Donald Trump,” he said.

Charlottesville, which has a population of 47,000, had 80% of its voters choose Hillary Clinton last year.

The city has not been known as a hotspot for white nationalism. There aren’t historical precedents to the current white nationalist gatherings in Charlottesville, local historian Rick Britton said in an email.

And it may not be over after Saturday if Kessler gets his way.

“We’re going to have bigger and bigger events in Charlottesville,” he said.

While Charlottesville was once named America’s happiest city in 2014 by the National Bureau of Economic Research, some residents aren’t very happy about what’s happening. Many are tired of the white nationalist rallies and have demanded the city revoke their permit.

In July, more that 200 residents packed City Hall demanding that the city cancel Saturday’s rally, CNN affiliate WVIR reported.

“I can very easily see this just eroding and erupting throughout the streets of Charlottesville and putting our citizens in danger,” said one speaker, Don Gathers.

“A five-hour block with over 400 angry folks coming in spewing just hatred and vitriol can truly be a problem and I don’t know how you can control that,” he said.

Meanwhile, some businesses have declared their stores as safe spaces and posted signs of support for equality and diversity ahead of the weekend’s event, reported WVIR.","Charlottesville, known as a progressive college town, is bracing for another white nationalist rally scheduled for Saturday.

They were met with about 1,000 counterprotesters. The local chapter of the NAACP organized a counter-rally. Shouting “racists go home,” the crowd drowned out the Klansmen’s chants.

Kessler: ‘We’re going to have bigger events’

The previous two rallies were “seen as an affront to the liberal population of this city and of the country,” Kessler said.

The events “reopened the wound. It stuck a finger on the raw nerve of this population that has already failed to get over the election of Donald Trump,” he said.

Charlottesville, which has a population of 47,000, had 80% of its voters choose Hillary Clinton last year.

The city has not been known as a hotspot for white nationalism. There aren’t historical precedents to the current white nationalist gatherings in Charlottesville, local historian Rick Britton said in an email.

And it may not be over after Saturday if Kessler gets his way.

“We’re going to have bigger and bigger events in Charlottesville,” he said.

While Charlottesville was once named America’s happiest city in 2014 by the National Bureau of Economic Research, some residents aren’t very happy about what’s happening. Many are tired of the white nationalist rallies and have demanded the city revoke their permit.

In July, more that 200 residents packed City Hall demanding that the city cancel Saturday’s rally, CNN affiliate WVIR reported.

“I can very easily see this just eroding and erupting throughout the streets of Charlottesville and putting our citizens in danger,” said one speaker, Don Gathers.

“A five-hour block with over 400 angry folks coming in spewing just hatred and vitriol can truly be a problem and I don’t know how you can control that,” he said.

Charlottesville, known as a progressive college town, is bracing for another white nationalist rally scheduled for Saturday.

Police anticipate as many as 2,000 to 6,000 people, including counterprotesters, to converge in the Virginia city, in an event that could be “the largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States,” as described by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

So how did Charlottesville, which previously has been of little interest to white nationalists, become the rallying ground for what appears to be the third such event in the city this year?

Saturday’s “Unite the Right” event would bring white nationalists, neo-Confederates and alt-right activists to the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee at Emancipation Park, which had recently been renamed from Lee Park.

The same park was the site of a May demonstration in which a group carried torches led by white nationalist Richard Spencer around the Lee statue to protest its removal.

In July, a Ku Klux Klan rally in Charlottesville drew about 50 Klan members and supporters who gathered around a statue of Confederate Lt. Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson.

The historic city, home of Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia, has become the latest Southern battleground over the contested removal of Confederate monuments.

Like many cities, Charlottesville has grappled with what to do with its Confederate monuments — symbols of the Civil War that represent heritage to some, hate to others.

In April, the city council voted to remove the bronze statue of Lee, CNN affiliate WVIR reported. It was one of several steps Charlottesville is taking to reduce its Confederate monuments. The removal is on hold pending litigation.

The city became an ideal protest site for white nationalists.

“This entire community is a very far left community that has absorbed these cultural Marxist principles advocated in college towns across the country, about blaming white people for everything,” said Jason Kessler, who organized the “Unite the Right” rally.

Kessler, a Charlottesville resident, blames what he calls “the anti-white hatred that’s coming out of the city.”

Although other cities such as New Orleans, St. Louis and Austin have contended with the Confederate monuments issue, it is Charlottesville where the rallies are happening.

“Charlottesville has kind of been put on the map recently,” Mayor Mike Signer said last month. “We want to change the narrative by telling the true story of race through public spaces. That has made us a target for groups that hate that change and want to stay in the past, but we will not be intimidated.”

Outraged by the decision to remove the Lee statue, protesters in May converged around the monument carrying torches led by Spencer, who had returned to his college town. He is a graduate of the University of Virginia and lives in the state.

The gathering was swiftly condemned by city leaders, including Signer, who said it was “either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instill fear in our minority populations in a way that harkens back to the days of the KKK.”

But the fiery imagery from that event had a searing effect.

“Obviously that first event kickstarted public interest,” he said.

The torch light rally was well-received by extremists, said Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups and extremists.

“They love what they consider to be a powerful image. A lot of people pointed out that it looked like Klan harassing black people. They didn’t have a problem with that.”

“It’s partly because that went so well, that’s why they keep returning to Charlottesville,” Beirich added.

Two months later, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally at another Charlottesville park, which had been renamed Justice Park from Stonewall Jackson Park.

Clad in Klan robes and carrying Confederate flags, members of the North Carolina-based Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan marched to the park and chanted “white power.”

Citing memories of both the Korean War and the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped on Japan at the end of World War II, the elected officials write, “The cost of maintaining peace may be difficult, but it is always a better deal than paying the ultimate price of war. And when it comes to atomic or nuclear weapons, we must collectively say, ‘Never Again.’”

“Even though we’re all Korean-Americans serving in state and local elected positions, we’ve never really come together before this week on behalf of Korean-Americans or Korean issues ― mainly because we have just diverse constituencies,” Keam said. “It would be shocking to me for a community of that caliber and that relevance to just sit there and say this doesn’t really affect us.”

We are a group of Korean American elected officials who serve at the state and local levels of governments throughout the United States. Like all Americans, we are unnerved by North Korea’s continuing display of military actions and saber rattling rhetoric, and we fully recognize the threat that this regime presents to its own citizens and to the entire world. There are more than 1.8 million Americans of Korean ancestry living in the United States today, many of whom we represent as constituents. While we agree that measures must be taken to reduce or end the tensions on the Korean peninsula, we respectfully urge you to reconsider the way you and your Administration are reacting to this situation by avoiding dangerous language that could end up unnecessarily escalating the conflicts even more. The Republic of Korea is one of the world’s great democracies and a strong economic and military partner for the United States. It is also one of the most populated regions of the world, with 51 million people living in South Korea and 25 million people living – mostly unwillingly – under authoritarian rule in North Korea. South Korea’s capital city, Seoul, has a population of 10 million living just 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Among them are nearly 30,000 American military service members and civilians who work closely with the Republic of Korea’s government to protect our mutual interests. There are also over 130,000 American citizens who live, work or study in Korea today. On a peninsula this small in geography, it is clear that no military action involving “fire and fury like the world has never seen” can be targeted solely at the North Korean regime. Any such attack will be absolutely devastating to the entire peninsula and surrounding regions, not to mention the long-term effects of destabilized international relations, destroyed communities, and depressed economies. Mr. President, this is not a time for any side to escalate the language of warfare and to introduce the threat of nuclear weapons. As Korean Americans, we have clear and deep memories of the last time military conflict arose on the Korean peninsula. Over 36,000 Americans gave their lives to fight against communism. Millions of Korean families live with collective memories of both the American and Korean bloodshed and the unending yearning for those loved ones who were lost or separated during the three year war. As Asian Americans, we are also painfully aware of the unspeakable tragedy and destruction from weapons of mass destruction deployed in a small region, as we reflect upon the 72nd anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki this week. If we have learned any lessons from WWII, it is that the cost of maintaining peace may be difficult, but it is always a better deal than paying the ultimate price of war. And when it comes to atomic or nuclear weapons, we must collectively say, “Never Again.” That is why we ask you to pursue all diplomatic options and strategies and to fully staff your State Department with policy experts who understand the Korean peninsula, so that, working with all stakeholders, we can find a workable and permanent peaceful resolution.",It's the first time Korean-American elected officials have spoken in one voice on the issue.

Jamaa I. Johnson, 36, of Wytheville, Virginia, is connected to armed robberies dating back to the fall of 2011. Darrell E. Gillespie and others traveled to Pittsburgh to rob a drug dealer. Afterward, the men came to Charleston to split up the marijuana that was stolen.

Johnson, Gillespie and their co-conspirators participated in six more robberies in West Virginia and Virginia, all of which involved firearms. During a Jan. 18, 2012, robbery in Charleston, a victim was shot in the leg and stabbed.

Johnson was convicted in January 2015 for his role. He and Gillespie were both found guilty of conspiracies to commit armed robbery and to use firearms in crimes of violence.

Johnson was also found guilty of witness tampering for attempting to use his ex-girlfriend to craft a false alibi for the Jan. 18, 2012, robbery.

Gillespie is still awaiting sentencing. He faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years and up to life in prison.","Jamaa I. Johnson, 36, of Wytheville, Virginia, is connected to armed robberies dating back to the fall of 2011."

— -- Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has placed the National Guard on standby in preparation for a rally in Charlottesville on Saturday, where at least 1,000 nationalists are expected to attend.

The Unite the Right rally is scheduled to take place Saturday at McIntire Park in Charlottesville, the city said on its website. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said in a statement that the event could be the ""largest white supremacist gathering in a decade.""

McAuliffe said in a statement that while he believes the majority of the rally's participants will express their views ""safely and respectfully,"" he believes that some attendees may be violent.

“Virginia is the birthplace of the rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly that make our country great,"" McAuliffe said. ""...However, in advance of tomorrow’s rally, there have been communications from extremist groups, many of which are located outside of Virginia, who may seek to commit acts of violence against rally participants or law enforcement officials.""

The ""alt-right"" movement is characterized by a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism, according to The Associated Press.

McAuliffe urged residents who plan to attend -- whether in support or opposition of the rally -- to make alternative plans.

""Many of the individuals coming to Charlottesville tomorrow are doing so in order to express viewpoints many people, including me, find abhorrent,"" he said. ""As long as that expression is peaceful, that is their right. But it is also the right of every American to deny those ideas more attention than they deserve.""

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is representing the event's organizer -- right-wing blogger Jason Kessler -- in a lawsuit filed Aug. 10 against the city of Chartlottesville and City Manager Maurice Jones. The suit claims that Kessler’s first amendment and constitutional rights were violated because on Aug. 7, city officials initially tried to revoke his original event permit, and then changed the location of the event.

The city claimed that this was a result of the high number of expected attendees, and not because of public pressure to stop the rally from taking place, Claire Gastañaga, executive director of the ACLU of Virginia, told ABC News.

While Gastañaga said the ACLU disagrees with Kessler's speech, she criticized city officials for attempting to revoke the permit without due process.

""We think it's important the government make decisions in the sunlight,"" she said.

A representative for the city of Charlottesville did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for a comment in regard to the lawsuit.

The rally is expected to draw at least 1,000 participants, according to an affidavit from Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas, which was provided to ABC News from the ACLU. Emancipation Park, the original event location, would have been unable to accommodate a peaceful crowd safely, Jones said in an affidavit.

""There is no doubt that Mr. Kessler has a First Amendment right to hold a demonstration and to express his views,"" the city manager wrote in a statement on Aug. 7. ""Nor is there any doubt that we, as a city, have an obligation to protect those rights, the people who seek to exercise them, and the broader community in which they do. We have determined that we cannot do all of these things effectively if the demonstration is held in Emancipation Park.""

Large crowds are also expected in downtown Charlottesville on Saturday, the city said, with high numbers of protesters demonstrating against the rally expected to be among those in attendance.

When Kessler applied for the permit on May 30, he proposed the event as a ""free speech rally in support of the Lee monument,"" according to Jones' affidavit. The city has plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park, which was formerly known as Lee Park, according to the complaint.

""Just as the Unite the Right participants have the right to air their views, so do those who want to protest against those views,"" said Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer in a statement. ""Democracy can be noisy, and it can be messy. But by ensuring we protect both public safety and the Constitution through the city manager's decision, I firmly believe that we will emerge from the weekend of August 12 a stronger community than ever.""

ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt said the organization agrees with Signer.

“The white supremacist rally in Charlottesville is the latest indication that the darkest corners of society are emboldened to come forward and openly parade their bigotry on main street,” said Greenblatt. “We continue to stand with Charlottesville Mayor Signer and those who reject intolerance. Hate has no place in our communities.""

On May 13, noted white nationalist Richard Spencer led protesters with torches in a Charlottesville rally against the planned removal of Confederate statues in the city.","At least 1,000 white nationalists are expected to attend the rally."

Virginia’s governor has urged people to stay away from a planned weekend rally of far-right and white supremacist groups in the university town of Charlottesville.

Charlottesville, an otherwise sleepy city of 46,000 in central Virginia, is bracing for an influx of hundreds of far-right activists – among them white supremacists and neo-Nazis from across the United States – on Saturday to protest against the planned removal of a Confederate monument.

The National Guard has been put on alert because of the risk of violence during the “Unite the Right” rally.

“In advance of [Saturday’s] rally there have been communications from extremist groups, many of which are located outside of Virginia, who may seek to commit acts of violence against rally participants or law enforcement officials,” Governor Terry McAuliffe said in a statement.

“In the event that such violent or unlawful conduct occurs, I have instructed state public safety officials to act quickly and decisively in order to keep the public and themselves safe.

“Many of the individuals coming to Charlottesville are doing so in order to express viewpoints many people, including me, find abhorrent.

“I want to urge my fellow Virginians who may consider joining either in support or opposition to the planned rally to make alternative plans.”

Thousands of white nationalists, including supporters of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) white supremacist group, and anti-fascist activists are expected to turn out in Charlottesville, the town planning to remove a statue of General Robert E Lee, who led Confederate forces during the US Civil War.

“The Charlottesville event could be a potentially historic showcase of hate, bringing together more extremists in one place than we have seen in at least a decade,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, a group that monitors and combats anti-Semitism.

Governor McAuliffe, a Democrat, said he had given security forces instructions to act quickly and decisively if violence breaks out.

Units of the Virginia National Guard will be placed on standby, he added.

Before the rally, David Duke, the former Imperial Wizard of the KKK, called on his supporters to descend on Charlottesville.

The League of the South also urged its members to be prepared for violent confrontations with anti-fascists and the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement.

In a blog post on its website, the neo-Confederate organisation said the rally would “affirm the right of southerners and white people to organise for their own interests just like any other group is able to do, free of persecution”.

In recent months, Confederate monuments like the statue in Charlottesville have become key venues for the alt-right and other far-rightists.

In May, alt-right leader Richard Spencer led a rally of torch-wielding far-right activists at the monument, although several hundred counterprotesters outnumbered them.

Lisette Pylant met up with Justin Schweiger for a first date over drinks that evening, only to discover 45 minutes in that he'd double-booked. Or rather, she learned as the night went on, that he'd planned six consecutive dates at the same bar.

Pylant, 26, and the others became friends during the bizarre experience - yes, this is ""John Tucker Must Die"" in real life. And she took to Twitter to create a now-viral thread that documented the events as they unfolded. The night eventually attracted the attention of many national news outlets, including ""Good Morning America,"" as the story embodied society's worst fears of what dating culture in the app age has become.

We've talked to four of the women and Schweiger, 28, to piece together the timeline. Schweiger, a D.C. resident, initially declined to comment on Wednesday afternoon due to a contract he signed with ""Inside Edition,"" where he appeared on Thursday. ""I got paid off real well,"" he now says.

5:15 p.m. Pylant, who lives in Northeast Washington, showed up at the Truxton Inn in D.C. for a follow-up date with seemingly normal guy Schweiger, whom she initially met while out celebrating her birthday Saturday night. A friend who works at Truxton Inn shot Pylant a warning text conveying, as she said in her Twitter thread, that ""this guy sucks."" But at this point she decided to stick it out.

Schweiger claims he told Pylant ""many times"" that he only viewed her as a friend. ""She either did not hear it (or) did not want to hear it,"" he says. (Pylant had no comment.)

6 p.m. Incorvaia, 25, arrived at the bar after leaving work, as Schweiger had been vague about meeting at a specific time. The Arlington, Virginia, resident had matched with Schweiger over the weekend on the dating app Hinge, and he had suggested that they grab a drink sometime. (Funnily enough, Hinge is described as a destination for those ""ready to escape dating app games."")

Schweiger introduced Pylant as his friend, which Incorvaia believed. "" 'This is my friend, I brought her to make sure you weren't going to kill me,' "" she recalls him saying. ""Some comment like that.""

Pylant played along, until Schweiger left to take a phone call. She then filled Incorvaia in on what was likely going down. ""She's like, 'You need to run, this guy's the worst,' "" Incorvaia says.

6:30 p.m. Incorvaia texted her friends about the situation and, at this point, lost all faith in dating apps. ""That was my first Hinge date ever,"" she says. ""I don't do online dating - just downloaded it this weekend. This is the experience I had, and I don't know if I'll be doing online dating anymore.""

6:35 p.m. Raven, 26, called Schweiger and let him know that she was outside the bar.She had shown up 10 minutes late to the date, but then waited another 10 minutes, with no sign of Schweiger. (Raven, a D.C. resident who met Schweiger on Bumble, requested that we not use her last name.) He told her to meet him inside, where he was sitting with ""a couple friends,"" she recalls, so Raven went in and asked the bartender where they might be sitting. Schweiger had taken a smoke break, and the bartender pointed to Pylant and Incorvaia.

""I gave myself a couple minutes and then introduced myself,"" Raven says. ""They said they just met, and that's when I realized it was a triple date."" She'd already ordered a drink, though, so the three women decided to hang out, finish their drinks and later get dinner together elsewhere.

6:40 p.m. Schweiger came back inside and, according to Raven, ""continued the conversation as if nothing was wrong.""

""At first, I was like, this can't be real life,"" she adds. ""And then I was like, this is awkward as hell.""

Pylant shared that reaction and, because it's 2017, decided to start tweeting. She'd already been texting multiple friends about the situation, and Twitter seemed like an easy way to fill more people in. ""It was so ridiculous and too good of a story not to tell people,"" she says.

""Her rant on Twitter is kind of childish,"" he says.

If you're wondering, yes, the conversation was uncomfortable. Schweiger began to explain why he broke up with his ex-girlfriend at one point, according to Pylant's thread, and Raven ""asked if he also met her on a 'group date.' ""

7:35 p.m. After having stayed for almost an hour more to ""see how it would ride out,"" Incorvaia says, the women decided to skip out while Schweiger went outside once more. ""We ordered another round of drinks while he was outside, we finished our drinks and we were like, 'Got to go, bye!' ""

The women went to Anxo, a cidery across the street.

Schweiger says he often schedules multiple ""conversations,"" which ordinarily last from 30 minutes to an hour, to test compatibility before committing to a dinner date. As an IT project manager, he thinks ""steps ahead.""

""I appreciate time,"" he says. ""Time is the only thing humans have. When it runs out, you're not a human anymore. I'm an efficient person.""

He assumed the women were aware that these were not ""real"" dates.

8 p.m. The women had befriended the Truxton Inn bartenders, one of whom texted the group about the newest arrival. Bowers never joined the women across the street.

8:30 p.m. Woody, a 25-year-old D.C. resident, stood outside Truxton Inn, waiting for Schweiger to reply to her text. (They had set up the date for 8:30 p.m. after meeting on Bumble.) Schweiger told her he was still at his friend's house in the neighborhood. At that point, one of Pylant's friends (not one of the dates) exited Truxton Inn and remarked to Woody: ""Can you believe it? There's this guy inside that's on his fourth date tonight."" Immediately, Woody knew she was the fifth. And she wasn't here for it.

9 p.m. Woody headed to Anxo, where Pylant's friend told her the other dates would be. (Schweiger, presumably, was still with his fourth date, Bowers.) ""I sent him the photo of the four of us together and say, 'Oh, I found your dates one through three,' "" Woody says. Incorvaia adds that Schweiger replied something like, ""Hahaha, tell them I say hi.' ""

9:10 p.m. Just for kicks, Woody went back to Truxton Inn to meet her - and everyone else's - date. As Bowers stood up to leave, Woody approached Schweiger and said, ""Hi, I'm date No. 5,"" to which Schweiger replied, ""Oh, you're already cut.""

""As if we're on MTV,"" Woody says. ""He was really cocky about it, and then I was like, 'OK, if you're going to do this, at least be upfront about it.' ""

Woody returned to Anxo, where the women bonded over the insane happenings.

""We just ended up clicking and hanging out,"" Woody says. ""We have a group message."" They've even made brunch plans.

Pylant's thread had been made into a Twitter ""moment"" by now, and thousands were along for the ride.

""It's the age of really stupid stories,"" Schweiger says. ""We're also in the age of reality TV. People want to relate.""

10:15 p.m. Incorvaia, Raven and Woody eventually headed home, and Pylant returned to Truxton Inn to chat with her friend who worked there and see what was up. Perhaps not so surprisingly, Schweiger was seated next to his sixth date, who Pylant said was visiting from out of town.

11 p.m. It's unclear when Free's date began, but, according to Pylant's thread, it ended soon after Pylant showed up.

Tuesday: The following 24 hours were crazy for all six women, who were bombarded with interview requests and texts from curious friends and family members. Outlets from New York magazine to HuffPost had stories up early in the morning.

Twitter fame is something Pylant, an office manager and barista, never expected.

""The only thing I've ever tweeted in my life is, like, 'Scandal,' "" she says. ""Definitely new for me.""

Wednesday, 8:30 a.m. The women appeared on ""Good Morning America."" ""We just figured this guy needed to be called out,"" Pylant said on the show.

""I'm in shock about how big it got, how big it blew up,"" Incorvaia says.

Raven adds, ""I guess it goes to show that the dating scene for young professionals in D.C. is getting tougher by the day.""

""I would love for this to launch me into some kind of writing career or writing for a show - a sitcom, be a personality,"" he tells The Post. ""I can say funny things. Before it happened, I signed up for DC Improv classes.""

Would he ever do a multi-date again? Sure, but with a few tweaks.

""These will be two-hour windows,"" he says. ""Do not overstack. Be honest and upfront about what they are, which I thought I did.""","While the rest of us were enthralled by the ""Bachelorette"" finale on Monday night, six women in Washington, D.C., became unwitting participants in an epic dating game of their own."

It’s not an easy argument to win, and it’s not clear how much support the idea has: The leading Southern nationalist group, the Alabama-based League of the South, has been making the same claim for more than two decades and still has an address in the U.S.A., not the C.S.A.

But the idea of a break-away Southern nation persists.

The League of the South’s longtime president, retired university professor Michael Hill of Killen, Alabama, posted a message in July that began, “Fight or die white man” and went on to say Southern nationalists seek “nothing less than the complete reconquest and restoration of our patrimony — the whole, entire South.”

“And that means the South will once again be in name and in actuality White Man’s Land. A place where we and our progeny can enjoy Christian liberty and the fruits of our own labor, unhindered by parasitical ‘out groups,’” said Hill’s message, posted on the group’s Facebook page a day after a rally in support of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The group’s website says it is “waging a war to win the minds and hearts of the Southern people,”

While white-controlled government is its goal, the group says in a statement of beliefs that it offers “good will and cooperation to Southern blacks in areas where we can work together as Christians to make life better for all people in the South.”

According to the U.S. Census, 55 percent of the nation’s black population lived in the South in 2010, and 105 Southern counties had a black population of 50 percent or higher.

Hill said they’re not advocating for a repeat of a Civil War that claimed 620,000 lives or a return to slavery, the lynchpin of the South’s antebellum economy.

“We have no interest in going back and recreating an un-recreatable past,” Hill said in a telephone interview. “We are future oriented.”

The group has erected billboards that said “SECEDE” in several states, and it even has its own banner — a black and white version of the familiar Confederate battle flag, minus the stars.

Secession also finds support on some websites that support white nationalism, including Occidental Dissent, run by a Hill associate, and the openly racist, anti-Semitic Daily Stormer. Extremist watchdog Heidi Beirich said strict Southern nationalism seems to have been swept up into the larger white-power agenda in recent years.

“I think it’s mostly subsumed into the white nationalist movement,” said Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center. “There might be a little Southern softness to it. But I can’t tell a whole lot of difference between the League and white nationalism.”

Meanwhile, critics are howling over the mere idea that HBO is considering a dramatic series based on the idea that the South really did secede again and slavery still existed.

But secession isn’t the sole property of Southern white nationalists.

A group that wants California to secede from the United States is based mainly on liberals wanting to exit the United States because of President Donald Trump’s election. They are collecting signatures to place a secession ballot initiative on the 2018 ballot.

The initiative would form a commission to recommend avenues for California to pursue its independence and delete part of the state constitution that says it’s an inseparable part of the United States. The “Calexit” initiative also would instruct the governor and congressional delegation to negotiate more autonomy for California.

Secession also has been discussed on and off for years by the far right in states including Texas, particularly when Barack Obama was president.

Online, many Southern nationalists seem animated by drives to remove Confederate memorials, as happened in New Orleans and is planned in Charlottesville, Virginia. Not everyone who supports Confederate monuments wants to remove the South from the United States once again. Some supporters of the Old South say they simply want to honor ancestors who wore the gray during the Civil War.

But some want to make a break.

Perhaps the United States should just let the South leave, said author Chuck Thompson.

Thompson’s 2012 book “Better Off Without ‘Em: A Northern Manifesto for Southern Secession” argued that both the United States and the South might both be best served if Southern nationalists won the argument and succeeded in forming a new nation.

The South has been at odds with the rest of the nation for generations over issues including education, race, politics, shared history and religion, Thompson said in a telephone interview, and some things just don’t change.

“It’s not that just the rest of the country would be better off without them,” he said. “It’s that everyone would be better off without them, both sides.”","Online, many Southern nationalists seem animated by drives to remove Confederate memorials."

Cathy McMorris Rodgers’ frustrated attempts to secure changes for veterans’ care in Spokane just fell through the roof.

Based on complaints funneled through a group of veterans who have protested for a year about the lack of cooperation from the staff at Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center, McMorris Rodgers asked for staff from the House Veterans Affairs Committee to come to Spokane in June and investigate conditions at the hospital. Among the problems they discovered: a hole in the roof.

The hole apparently has been leaking water for about five years. McMorris Rodgers said VA staff has known about the problem, evidenced by the fact that someone had built a rectangular funnel to catch water dripping through the roof. The funnel channels water through a hose into a metal bucket.

But the make-shift-leak-management system is located only feet from hospital’s large electrical panel that fuels power to the entire facility, she said.

“Just how unbelievable it was to learn we had a leaking roof,” McMorris Rodgers said. “And it’s been going on for years and hasn’t been addressed.”

Lily Haken, executive assistant to the director at Mann-Grandstaff, said safety for veterans and employees is “our highest priority.”

She did not respond to questions as to why the hole has remained unfixed for years.

“We are aware of this issue and have an action plan in place to fix the roof,” she wrote. “We are monitoring it closely and can ensure that it is not impacting patient safety.”

The leaking roof is just the latest of a series of issues that McMorris Rodgers said she has been pushing to fix. Earlier this year, her efforts to re-open an exercise room that some veterans had been using for continuing care and exercise were rebuffed by Administrator Ron Johnson. He recently moved to a different facility in Hampton, Virginia.

Asked if she was frustrated by her dealings with VA officials, McMorris Rodgers answered: “Absolutely. I’ve been told it’s funding. ‘We need more money,’” she said. “But as a representative for this district, I know I have voted to increase the budget every year for the VA.”

She said in years past she was personally told by Johnson, who recently was replaced by interim director Tracye Davis from Portland, that the local facility had millions of unused funding left over at the end of the year. Johnson said the extra money would be used to purchase prescriptions for veterans, she said.

“It begs the question: Why weren’t you fixing the roof?” McMorris Rodgers said. “There are a lot of great employees. And I often hear that veterans, when they get to the providers, are pleased to get the care they receive.

“But, it’s too difficult to get the care they need. We want the VA to be the center of excellence. Unfortunately, too many times I see veterans getting lost in the system.”

Charles Bourg, of Chewelah, is one of the veterans who have been picketing the front of the hospital since last August. He said he appreciates the work of staffers from McMorris Rodgers and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray to try to force changes.

“We are grateful they are helping us,” Bourg said. “Most of the employees are telling us not to quit and that they are supporting us.”

But the veterans often hear talk of changes without seeing any. Just this week Bourg said he called to get in to see his doctor. He was told the earliest available appointment is Oct. 5.

McMorris Rodgers said she recently sat down with Davis, the interim director, who seemed to be willing to improve conditions.

“I know as soon as we discovered that the roof was leaking, we immediately went to work to get the money to get it fixed,” she said.

The hole is scheduled to be fixed sometime by the end of the year.","The slow burn by U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers to secure changes for veterans’ care in Spokane just fell through the roof.

It’s just the latest in a growing number of law enforcement agencies using a new assessment form.

 With a push from the Commonwealth's attorney general, Lynchburg’s police department is one of the first in Central Virginia to now carry the national lethality assessment.

 

 “This assessment tool helps us to show them the danger levels and it also helps us to see the danger levels a little bit better,” Officer Eric Westervelt said.

The questionnaire is an asset used in the field by patrol officers when called to a domestic situation.

“If we look around the house and the house is trashed because that person threw a microwave across the room and knocked the TV off and broke it those are all signs that there's a violent tendency there from that person, the suspect, who may act out in a different (way) later,” Westervelt said.

Questions a victim may be asked from the assessment are, ""Do you think he or she might kill you?"" Based on the results, the higher the score, the greater the risk.

“It prompts us to make a phone call to the domestic violence shelters locally who have a 24 hour hotline set up so that we can call them. They can ask more questions.” Westervelt said.

Police say they use their best judgment to get the victim out, and placed somewhere safe, like a shelter.

“If you answer 'yes' to these three questions that's automatically a reason for them to call us, and before they call us they let the victim know that there is a service that's available,” said Brenda Dunning, the coordinator advocate for YWCA.

In collaboration with the YWCA of Central Virginia, police and advocates say only time will tell. But they say the best choice is to get out while you can.

Spencer said he would follow directions from the president on transgender people in the military but believes “any patriot” should be allowed to serve.

Spencer, speaking to reporters on Thursday on a visit to Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia, said he would abide by any policy the Pentagon provides to the armed forces on the transgender issue.

However, Spencer said he believes that, on a fundamental basis, “any patriot that wants to serve and meets all the requirements should be able to serve in our military,” according to news reports.

President Donald Trump announced on Twitter last month that he would ban transgender people from serving in the military “in any capacity,” reviving a ban that had ended in 2016.

WASHINGTON — On Monday morning, we wrote how divided Republicans are six and half months into Trump’s presidency, especially after the GOP-led Senate failed in its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. Well, things have gotten only more divided since then. Consider:
• Vulnerable Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., now has a GOP primary challenger in Danny Tarkanian;
• Politico reports that one of Trump’s top donors, Robert Mercer, is contributing $300,000 to a Super PAC supporting the Republican challenging incumbent Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz;
• Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said in a radio interview that John McCain’s no-vote on health care might have been due to his brain tumor; Johnson has called his remarks “unfortunate” and “clumsy”;
• And maybe in the most significant skirmish to date, President Trump is now going after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!” Trump tweeted this morning.

That Trump tweet — and an earlier one from Wednesday — came after McConnell criticized Trump's ""excessive expectations"" on health care.

""Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before,"" McConnell said. ""I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.""

Politics inevitably produces tension and conflict, even among allies from the same party. Things, after all, weren’t always rosy between Barack Obama’s White House and Harry Reid/Nancy Pelosi. But that Democratic tension never came this early in a presidency — and it certainly never was this public.

Republicans, who control all branches of government, still have plenty on their to-do list — tax reform, passing a budget, funding the government and raising the debt ceiling. But all of those items become much harder to achieve when there’s public conflict between the president and the Senate majority leader.

Yet just to emphasize how Republicans don’t have a monopoly on party divisions, don’t miss this New York Times dispatch on Democrat-vs.-Democrat conflict in California.

“Even at a time of overall success, state Democrats are torn by a bitter fight for the party leadership, revealing the kind of divisions — between insiders and outsiders, liberals and moderates — that unsettled the national party last year and could threaten its success in coming years,” the Times writes.

“The fight pits Eric C. Bauman, a longtime party leader, against Kimberly Ellis, a Bay Area activist. Mr. Bauman won the election by just over 60 votes out of 3,000 cast at the party convention in May, but Ms. Ellis has refused to concede, claiming voting improprieties, like permitting ineligible people to vote for Mr. Bauman.”

More: “The party is expected to issue a final ruling on Ms. Ellis’s allegations by Aug. 20; in an interview, she said she would go to court if the party ruled against her.”

But there’s one difference between Trump vs. McConnell and this Dem-on-Dem fight in California: Republicans were victorious nine months ago, while Democrats are still reeling from their surprise White House defeat. The winning party is always supposed to be more unified than the losing party.

Just to remind you how the Russia story isn’t going away — and only seems to be intensifying — is this news from yesterday: “FBI agents searched one of the residences of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort last month, a dramatic escalation in the special counsel's Russia investigation,” NBC News confirmed.

“The agents ‘executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences,’ Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, told NBC News. ‘Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well.’”

Here’s the Washington Post, which broke the story: “The raid, which occurred without warning on July 26, signaled an aggressive new approach by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his team in dealing with a key figure in the Russia inquiry. Manafort has been under increasing pressure as the Mueller team looked into his personal finances and his professional career as a highly paid foreign political consultant.”

U.S. has prepared to use B-1 bombers in response to North Korea

As for the rising tensions with North Korea, NBC’s Cynthia McFadden and team report that the Pentagon has prepared the use of B-1 bombers on North Korea’s missile sites. “‘Of all the military options … [President Trump] could consider, this would be one of the two or three that would at least have the possibility of not escalating the situation,’ said retired Adm. James Stavridis, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe and an NBC News analyst.”

“‘There is no good option,’ a senior intelligence official involved in North Korean planning told NBC News, but a unilateral American bomber strike not supported by any assets in the South constitutes ‘the best of a lot of bad options.’”

Strange touts Trump support in new ad, while Brooks hits McConnell

Less than a week to go before the August 15 GOP Senate primary in Alabama, “U.S. Sen. Luther Strange released a new ad on Wednesday touting the endorsement he received less than 24 hours before from President Trump,” AL.com reports.

Meanwhile, Mo Brooks released this statement regarding the Trump-vs.-McConnell spat, per NBC’s Frank Thorp: “The President and I agree on this: McConnell and Luther Strange have failed. It’s time to ditch Mitch and his lackey Luther Strange. Whether you're talking ObamaCare, the Wall, or balancing the budget, the Trump Agenda is dead with McConnell and Strange in the Senate.""

Northam leads Gillespie by six points in Virginia, per Quinnipiac poll

A Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday found Democrat Ralph Northam leading Republican Ed Gillespie by six points in Virginia’s gubernatorial contest, 44 percent to 38 percent; Libertarian Cliff Hyra got 4 percent. Trump’s approval rating in the state is at 36 percent, while 51 percent approve of outgoing Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.",The Republican Party's goals will become much harder to achieve if there’s more public conflict between the president and the Senate majority leader.

“There is not one soul, not one, that has ever had an unkind word about Brian, not one."" Deavers pastor Billy Meek Jr. said. ""He loved horror movies and comic books and don’t you just love him for it? I did.""

Pastor Meek knew Deavers for ten years and he saw how much people loved him.

Deavers was a wrestling fanatic as well and owned his own car detail business

“Brian would come up here pick up my truck detail, bring it back and charge me like $20 bucks, I mean that was really something,” Meek said.

There are stories like that all over town -- none of them match up with what happened on July 25 at Deavers' home.

The TBI says this Dennis Steele came into this house and shot Deavers many times -- but killing him wasn't enough enough, he slashed his tires as well.

A very personal crime by a man who by all accounts so far -- never met Brian Deavers.

Burt Staggs is news director at WOPC FM radio...and investigates all local crime thoroughly.



“It appears Mr. Seale drove 10 hours to kill this man in a jealous rage,“ Staggs said.



He has spoken with several families members from both sides. He says this all began when Brian Deavers met a woman named Melissa Seale at Brian's mom's wedding. The two hit it off, they are shown in the photo above eating at a restaurant.

“This was a perceived love trial to the best of my knowledge the pair had only met one time at his mother's wedding -- and not seen each other again,” Staggs said.

Family and friends say the two had never gotten together again. Nevertheless -- Dennis Seale allegedly saw it as a perceived love triangle and drove 10 hours from Virginia to come to Hohenwald and murder Brian Deavers.

“It was a hate crime, it wasn't just a random murder, if you kill a man are you also going to do damage to his truck, that’s vicious and in the end it wasn’t worth it,” Meek said.

Dennis Seale is still in Virginia awaiting extradition to Lewis County.","When you say the name Brian Deavers in Hohenwald, you are going to get a reaction.&ldquo;There is not one soul, not one, that has ever had an unkind word about Brian, not one.

“I want to thank — from the bottom of my heart and from all the attendees of the Unite the Right rally, the ACLU, Rutherford Institute and the great, the legendary Kyle Bristow,” he said.

He also argued that the expected 2,000 counter-protesters coming to town to oppose the Unite the Right rally were not part of the two rallies planned for the downtown parks, but they would follow Kessler’s rally wherever it is held.

Brown said the city moved the rally because it can more easily be secured. The city estimates that 1,000 or more people are expected to be at the rally and that they will be met by about 2,000 counter-protesters.

“The 2,000 who are coming are coming for one purpose and one purpose only, and that’s to protest and counter-demonstrate against Mr. Kessler,” Brown told the judge. “We firmly believe there is a threat of violence if it takes place in Emancipation Park. We firmly believe the same threat of violence exists if it’s moved to McIntire Park. The key to preventing violence is to keep the sides apart and it is easier to keep the sides separate at McIntire because it is bigger.”

Brown said that Kessler’s free speech rights are not compromised by moving to a larger park because Kessler can espouse the same content at the same time for the same duration. The public safety would be better served by the added security to residents and businesses, he argued.

But ACLU attorney Victor Glasberg said the Emancipation Park location is central to Kessler’s rally because it is home to the Lee statue and the controversy that has surrounded the city’s decision to remove and rename the park. It was until recently called Lee Park. McIntire Park, meanwhile, is named for the philanthropist who donated the Lee Park land and statue.

“The city sat on its hands and let the situation get to the point that a large number of people are going to converge downtown,” he said. “City officials have repeatedly taken positions opposite to Mr. Kessler’s opinion. The decision to change the permit only occurred after the opposition developed in the community and the city.”

“Supporters of Kessler are likely to still appear at the park, even if the location of Kessler’s demonstration is moved elsewhere,” the judge wrote. “Thus, a change in the location of the demonstration would not eliminate the need for members of the city’s law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services personnel to appear at Emancipation Park. Instead, it would necessitate having personnel present at two locations in the city.”",A federal judge on Friday granted an injunction allowing the far-right Unite the Right rally to be held Saturday in Emancipation Park in the shadow of the statue of Confederate

The bar’s disciplinary board decided in May to lift a suspension it imposed in 2013, when Painter was found not guilty by way of insanity of charges that he gave guns and drugs to a convicted felon who had been his client.

While Painter still was awaiting resolution of the 2013 charges, he was in Pulaski County’s courthouse and told an assistant prosecutor that he was “going to eliminate Mary Pettitt from the gene pool.” That statement was treated as a threat and a judge revoked Painter’s bond and sent him back to jail to await trial on the drug and gun charges.

“Given that Painter has threatened my life and acted aggressively enough in my office towards another prosecutor to cause an officer to check to see what was going on, I feel it would be impossible to maintain a professional relationship with Painter,” Pettitt wrote. “To avoid any appearance of impropriety I would ask that a special prosecutor be appointed to prosecute any charges against defendants represented by him.”

“It’s a lie that I was aggressive with someone in her office,” Painter said. He said he remembered the encounter to which Pettitt referred but said it was prompted by what he saw as an assistant prosecutor’s anti-Semitism toward one of his clients. He said he only replied strongly to counter bigotry.

Epes testified that he asked Painter to clarify what he meant and Painter said “bar complaints and lawsuits, bar complaints and lawsuits,” before walking away. Epes was unsure of what to make of the statements and reported them to his boss, Pulaski County Commonwealth’s Attorney Mike Fleenor, before calling Pettitt, he said.

The 2013 suspension of Painter’s law license was the second for the longtime attorney. In 2003, the state bar pulled his license for a year after a case in which Painter entered guilty and no contest pleas to misdemeanor charges tied to setting grass fires in the Prices Meadow subdivision being developed near his residence at the time in Blacksburg. He received a suspended five-year prison sentence and was ordered to move away from the subdivision.

In 2013, Painter was sent to a mental health facility after being found not guilty by reason of insanity on the drug and gun charges. He was released, then sent back to the facility by court order in May 2015, according to court records.

Painter said this week that he is trying to re-start a criminal defense practice and is going through the process of having his name put on court lists so that judges can appoint him to represent defendants who cannot afford to hire their own attorneys.

Donald Caldwell, longtime Roanoke commonwealth’s attorney, said he also could not recall a similar situation. Noting that he was not familiar with all the details in Montgomery County, Caldwell said he thought Pettitt was doing the right thing — if only to maintain the appearance of fairness for Painter’s clients.",CHRISTIANSBURG — Montgomery County Commonwealth’s Attorney Mary Pettitt said Friday her office will not handle any case involving newly reinstated defense attorney Joseph Graham Painter.

Saturday’s Unite the Right rally — a gathering of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, members of the “alt-right” and other far right political groups — will be met by about 1,000 first responders, including law enforcement, according to city police Chief Al Thomas. The Virginia National Guard will be on standby, Gov. Terry McAuliffe said.

“These are trying and difficult times for our city and our nation,” Jones said. “We have deep political and ideological differences, and those differences will play out here in our community this weekend. It will be stressful and it will be tense, but I’m optimistic that cooler heads will prevail and we will ultimately be stronger as a community once this event is over.”

“Virginia State Police is leading the commonwealth’s planning and response for these events and will be on the scene in a support capacity before, during and after the planned rally,” McAuliffe said in the statement. “At my direction, personnel from the Virginia National Guard are also standing by to respond if needed.”

“We expect this to be a significant challenge for not only our public safety personnel, but also our community,” he said. “There’s a lot of anxiety in this community. We feel that we have the resources available to protect our community.”

In addition, city officials stated the rights to expression and protest will be honored this weekend, but that there is “no constitutional right to incite or promote violence by anyone who will be gathered this weekend,” Mayor Mike Signer said.

“Democracy may be noisy and it may be messy, but it remains the best system of government that people have figured out to use to govern themselves,” he said. “I am very confident that that system will get us through this weekend and that we will emerge from this weekend in the land that helped come up with this system of government even stronger than before.”

The demonstrators, who also yelled “blood and soil” — a phrase tied to Nazi ideology — made their way through the Charlottesville campus before encircling a group of counter-protesters gathered around a statue of Thomas Jefferson.

A fight broke out, and some of the white nationalists swung their tiki torches at people, according to the Daily Progress.

Members of both sides were reportedly hit with pepper spray, and several people were treated at the scene for minor injuries.

Police arrived on campus, declared it an unlawful assembly, and ordered the crowds to disperse. At least one person was arrested.

The event was a precursor to the Unite the Right rally scheduled for Saturday, when a number of far-right groups are expected to make a show of force in response to the city’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park.

Sharing a photo of the torch-bearing march on Friday, Unite the Right organizer Jason Kessler wrote on Twitter, “Incredible moment for white people who’ve had it up to here & aren’t going to take it anymore. Tomorrow we #UnitetheRight #Charlottesville.”

Prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer, who led a similar march in Charlottesville in May, was also at the rally on Friday night.

“When I think of torches, I want to think of the Statue of Liberty,” he wrote.

“When I think of candlelight, I want to think of prayer vigils. Today, in 2017, we are instead seeing a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights.

“I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.”

The Unite the Right rally, which is expected to draw 2,000 to 6,000 people, could be the “largest white supremacist gathering in a decade,” according to the Anti-Defamation League.

Gov. Terry McAuliffe warned people to stay away from the event on Saturday, noting that Virginia State Police and the Virginia National Guard will be monitoring the situation.

Kessler’s attorneys filed a lawsuit against Charlottesville on Thursday, claiming their attempts to relocate Saturday’s event to McIntire Park, due to safety considerations, violates his right to free speech.

 The magistrate made the ruling at the conclusion of a preliminary hearing in West Virginia. The case now heads to Pocahontas County Circuit Court. Erica Newsome remains jailed on $50,000 bond, according to court documents.

 

 There’s no word on when an autopsy will be performed on the 37-year-old woman’s daughter, Kaye-lea Plummer.

 

 Newsome doesn’t face charges in Florida yet, but investigators have said they found signs of foul play at her home in the Oceanway area of Jacksonville.

 

 Earlier this week, police reported Kaye-lea’s death. Her body was found after a crash in West Virginia. Authorities believe Newsome killed Kaye-lea inside their Jacksonville home and was attempting to drive her body to Buffalo, New York, where the child’s father lives, according to investigators.

After the wreck, Newsome was arrested and charged with concealing a dead body.

 

 The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office was contacted last Sunday afternoon by the West Virginia State Police and detectives began an investigation at Newsome's mobile home in Oceanway.

According to multiple reports in West Virginia, Newsome lost control of her vehicle Sunday and struck a guard rail on Allegheny Mountain, a mile and a half west of the Virginia border.

Motorists from New York City, traveling the same highway, reported seeing Newsome remove a body wrapped in a blanket from the vehicle and drag it over the hill.

 

 West Virginia State Police Sgt. Herby Barlow said Newsome and the body of her daughter were found on an old logging road about 150 feet over the embankment.","A magistrate determined on Friday that there is probable cause that a Jacksonville woman concealed the body of her 11-year-old daughter, and the case was bound over for grand jury consideration."

But one local expert said it's not time to panic.

Paul Avey is an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Virginia Tech who has studied and published work on smaller countries trying to combat larger ones.

He also was a pre-doctoral fellow with the Managing the Atom project and International Security Program at Harvard’s Belfer Center for International Studies, a Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at MIT.

He said we haven't seen real action to this point, everything has just been talk and posturing between both sides.

President Trump said Friday of North Korea, ""It is a very bad situation, it's a very dangerous situation, and it will not continue, that I can tell you.""

While the President may be right about this, Avey said it's nothing new to hear North Korea make threats. They've been doing it for 70 years.

""This is actually a lot less belligerent than some of the activities they've taken in the past, like seizing a U.S. navel vessel in the late 1960s,"" he said. ""The difference is, what makes people more nervous, of course, is that North Korea's nuclear capabilities and progressing. They just weren't at that level in the past.""

Even on the U.S. side, it's only aggressive words from President Trump, but it's nothing new.

""The rhetoric itself does sound a little bit different from the President than past Presidents, but the basic message of, 'Don't push too far,' has been issued consistently throughout U.S. history,"" Avey explained.

Avey said small countries like North Korea and their leaders like Kim Jong Un know they can't single handedly beat the U.S., that's why there hasn't been a nuclear weapon used in nearly a century.

""He's not suicidal, and the evidence so far is that he and his family want to stay in power, the basic deterrents logic is likely to hold.""

But Avey did say he would be nervous if the U.S. put troops in that region, or if there was an attack, either planned or not.

He explained, ""If North Korea decides to carry through on it's threat to test missiles near Guam, and one of them were to hit Guam, that's essentially an attack on American territory.""

And according to Avey, no President has ever had tolerance for something like that.

Trump also said Friday, ""If he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that's an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it, and he will regret it fast.""

Avey did said Friday afternoon he's excited about one piece of new information.

The Chinese government announced earlier in the day in their newspaper, China will not assist North Korea if they start a conflict with the U.S.

He said this could be a way to reign in Kim Jong Un from what he's been saying.","Virginia Tech Political Science Assistant Professor said we haven't seen real action to this point, everything has just been talk and posturing between both sides."

Reportedly he replied that “for years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa.”

The same thing might be said of Gov. Jim Justice and West Virginia, and it probably is the best explanation of his decision last week to change his voter registration from Democrat to Republican.

Ask yourself what the change did for Justice the politician. Neither party’s leadership is particularly fond of Justice, who has gone out of his way to ridicule — not just criticize, but belittle — both Republican and Democrat legislators. Remember, he gained the Democrat nomination for governor by defeating two establishment candidates, former state Senate President Jeff Kessler, D-Marshall, and former U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin. Then he thrashed the GOP nominee, then-Senate President Bill Cole, R-Mercer.

Justice is, as I’ve said many times, West Virginia’s answer to President Donald Trump. Both were elected as anti-establishment candidates who defied conventional wisdom by running not as the standard-bearer of one party, but as enemies of both.

As far as party loyalty goes, Justice has none. For years, he was a registered Republican. Then, in 2015, he switched to become a Democrat. Just a coincidence that months later, he would run for governor as a Democrat, I’m sure.

But now he’s back in the GOP fold, officially, at least. Why? Because it brings him closer to Trump than before. That’s good for West Virginia — and it’s good for Justice.

Recall that Justice and the Trump family were acquainted before either man gained office. That personal relationship has continued.

But there’s nothing like appearing to go out on a limb to do a friend a much-needed favor to cement a relationship. Trump, lacking the success he’d hoped for in Congress, needed something he could chalk up as a victory. Convincing a Democrat governor to switch parties qualifies.

So, my good friend Gov. Justice, what can I do for you?

Justice wants the government to pay electric utilities $15 a ton for Appalachian coal they burn in power plants. He has said top Trump administration figures have expressed interest in the idea.

Most people aren’t aware of it, but much of the coal burned in eastern power plants comes from surface mines in Wyoming and other western states. It’s cheaper and, in some ways, better for meeting environmental standards. Encouraging power plants in our region to burn more eastern coal — in part through the subsidy and also by relaxing EPA regulations — could do a world of good for eastern mining companies and Appalachian miners.

It would cost the government $4.5 billion a year, some have estimated. Critics say that’s an outrageous subsidy for one sector of the energy industry. I don’t recall them making the same complaint while former President Barack Obama was feeding billions to the wind- and solar-power industries, but that’s another story.

The beauty of Justice’s plan is that he happens to be one of those big eastern mining magnates. His son now is managing Justice mines in, if I recall correctly, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.

So if it’s good for the Appalachian region, it’s good for Jim Justice.

And don’t forget, Justice also is involved heavily in agriculture and resorts. Yes, the same kind of resorts Trump owns.

The two men have a lot in common, including, interestingly enough, a Russian connection. In 2009, Justice sold his mines to a Russian firm. In 2015, he bought them back, reportedly for a fraction of what the Russians paid a few years earlier.

During the past week, I’ve heard any number of speculations on why Justice switched parties (again). But the self-interest angle makes the most sense.

Oh, and don’t forget: As matters stand, it won’t hurt at re-election time for Justice to be viewed by many Mountain State voters as Donald Trump’s very good friend.

A car plowed into a crowd of people in a college town during a violent day in which three people died and at least 35 were sent to hospitals.An unlawful assembly and state of emergency were declared Saturday as demonstrators clashed on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, ahead of a ""Unite the Right"" rally. Hundreds of white nationalists and other right-wing groups battled with counter-protesters, as President Donald Trump and other public figures decried the violence.An eyewitness said the car backed up to gain more speed before driving into the crowd. Another witness told the ACLU of Virginia that a protester threw a rock at a gray Ford Mustang, which then turned back to hit people on a sidewalk.Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said counter-protesters were marching when ""suddenly there was just this tire screeching sound."" A silver sedan smashed into another car, then backed up, plowing through ""a sea of people.""A Virginia State Police spokesperson said the injuries ranged in severity from life-threatening to minor. Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said the crash killed a 32-year-old woman at an intersection where she was crossing the street.University of Virginia Health System said that 20 patients were brought there after the incident. The health system said on Saturday evening that five people are in critical condition, four in serious condition and 10 others in fair or good condition.The president also expressed his condolences to the young woman killed.A state police helicopter that was assisting the events in Charlottesville also crashed outside the city in a wooded area, killing two state troopers.The driver, James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old who recently moved to Ohio from where he grew up in Kentucky, was charged with second-degree murder and other counts. The crash happened about two hours after violent clashes broke out between white nationalists, who descended on the town to rally against the city's plans to remove a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and others who arrived to protest the racism.Field’s mother, Samantha Bloom, told The Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally“He had an African-American friend so ...,” she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she’d be surprised if her son’s views were that far right.Fields' arrest capped off hours of unrest. Hundreds of people threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Some came prepared for a fight, with body armor and helmets. Videos that ricocheted around the world on social media showed people beating each other with sticks and shields.The city said 15 other people were injured that related to the downtown rally.Three other men were also arrested during the day of violent clashes. The Virginia State Police announced late Saturday that Troy Dunigan, a 21-year-old from Chattanooga, Tennessee, was charged with disorderly conduct; Jacob L. Smith, a 21-year-old from Louisa, Virginia, was charged with assault and battery; and James M. O’Brien, 44, of Gainesville, Florida, was charged with carrying a concealed handgun.Trump also said he's spoken with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. The president said, ""We agreed that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now.""The president also said Americans must come together ""with love for our nation ... and true affection for each other."" He also said he wants the country to study the situation in Charlottesville and understand why events like these happen.University of Virginia Medical Center spokeswoman Angela Taylor confirmed that one person died, and no other details were immediately available.Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer said he is heartbroken over the loss of life.Violent clashes occur Friday, SaturdayPreviously, a scuffle occurred Friday night between torch-bearing demonstrators and counter-protesters at the nearby University of Virginia. Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a ""pro-white"" rally to protest the Charlottesville’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a downtown park.The violence continued Saturday, with people throwing punches, bottles and chemical sprays at each other. Police in riot gear had to break up the melees.Shortly before noon, the scheduled start of the rally at the college town's Emancipation Park, authorities declared it an unlawful assembly. A Virginia statute says ""whenever three or more persons assembled share the common intent to advance some lawful or unlawful purpose bu the commission of an act or acts of unlawful force or violence likely to jeopardize seriously public safety, peace or order.""A helicopter, apparently connected with state police, also crashed near the area, according to reports.Group sings, another chants 'blood and soil'At one point, a few dozen white men wearing helmets and holding makeshift shields chanted, ""Blood and soil!"" Nearby, a group of clergy and other counter-demonstrators, including activist and Harvard professor Cornel West, held hands, prayed and sang, ""This Little Light of Mine.""Ahead of Saturday's rally, tensions roiled Friday night as white nationalists — some holding what appeared to be backyard tiki-style torches — marched onto the University of Virginia's campus.Chanting, ""Blood and soil"" and ""You will not replace us,"" the group rallied around a statue of Thomas Jefferson before they clashed with counter-protesters, CNN affiliate WWBT reported. The group left the university's grounds when police arrived and declared the gathering an unlawful assembly.Signer, the mayor, also released a statement referring to Friday's rally as a ""cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights.""""Everyone has a right under the First Amendment to express their opinion peaceably, so here's mine: not only as the Mayor of Charlottesville, but as a UVA faculty member and alumnus, I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus,"" he added.Kessler said he doesn't consider himself to be a white nationalist. But, he said, ""we're going to start standing up for our history.""""The statue itself is symbolic of a lot of larger issues. The primary three issues are preserving history against this censorship and revisionism — this political correctness,"" he told CNN Friday.""The second issue is being allowed to advocate for your interests as a white person, just like other groups are allowed to advocate for their interests politically.

Dave Slagle. Officers would respond to complaints of possible drug activity from local residents, Slagle said. Undercover officers and confidential informants would purchase narcotics from dealers.

Drugs involved in the roundup included cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, psychedelic mushrooms and prescription medication. Slagle said Suboxone, a drug used to treat addiction to pain relievers, was especially prevalent in the roundup.

Each case was taken to the grand jury, where indictments were filed.

Early Friday, six teams of officers split up and began searching for a total of 83 individuals wanted on 193 indictments. Many wanted individuals resided in Bristol and were quickly rounded up, but others were wanted in Washington County, Virginia, Sullivan County, Tennessee, and Asheville, North Carolina.

Slagle said arrests were made in various types of neighborhoods, from city housing to middle-and upper-class neighborhoods.

Slagle said there were few, if any, problems while arresting the wanted individuals on Friday. He recalled no incidents of individuals resisting arrest. One person faces additional charges after police found marijuana and methamphetamine in his possession.

On a few occasions, police would pick up multiple people, including family members, from one location. Boyfriends and girlfriends, husbands and wives, and in one case, a mother and son, were arrested. Patrol officers responding to a shoplifting call also picked up two people wanted in the roundup.

Bristol Virginia Sheriff Jack Weisenburger said his staff was prepared for the influx of new inmates on Friday.

“The court will limit the sentence imposed upon the defendant in the event he is convicted of criminal contempt to the maximum authorized for a petty offense (imprisonment for up to six months or a fine of not more than $5,000) and thus the defendant has no right to a jury trial,” Judge Jones wrote in an order filed earlier this week.

That December, Jones agreed to allow the couple to receive an electronic copy of evidence to keep in their home.

Back in my day (I graduated in 2013, so it’s not a stretch) I was in a lot of Honors classes. You know how it was determined who got into these programs? Grades. If you were above a certain GPA, you were allowed to sign up for any AP class you wanted.

Are children going to be denied spots that they would have gotten until this policy change and what is that going to do to their transcripts when they apply for colleges?

Alt-right activists held torches and marched late Friday through the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville.

Chanting “blood and soil” and “one people, one nation, end immigration,” the group rallied around a statue of Thomas Jefferson before they clashed with counterprotesters, CNN affiliate WWBT reported.

The march came hours before a Saturday rally that police anticipate will attract as many as 2,000 to 6,000 people, in an event that could be the “largest hate-gathering of it’s kind in decades in the United States,” as described by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Before the group left the university’s grounds when police arrived and ruled it unlawful assembly, outraged city and UVA officials condemned Friday’s gathering.

“In my 47 years of association with @UVA, this was the most nauseating thing I’ve ever seen. We need an exorcism on the Lawn,” Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics tweeted.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer released a statement referring to Friday’s rally as a “cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights.”

“Everyone has a right under the First Amendment to express their opinion peaceably, so here’s mine: not only as the Mayor of Charlottesville, but as a UVA faculty member and alumnus, I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus,” he added.

University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan said law enforcement is investigating the “intolerable” violence displayed on the campus.

“I strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including University personnel who were attempting to maintain order,” she said in a statement. “Law enforcement continues to investigate the incident, and it is my hope that any individuals responsible for criminal acts are held accountable.”

Friday’s rally took place shortly after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction allowing alt-right activists to hold Saturday’s “Unite the Right” event in Emancipation Park around the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

Earlier this week, city officials had tried to “modify” the rally’s permit to move the demonstration more than a mile away to McIntire Park, citing safety concerns associated with the number of people expected to attend the rally and counter protests.

Jason Kessler, who organized the “Unite the Right” rally, filed a lawsuit Thursday claiming the city’s intentions will violate free speech rights.

“While the City is disappointed by tonight’s ruling we will abide by the judge’s decision,” the city said in a statement late Friday. “The goal in moving the Unite the Right Rally from Emancipation Park to a larger, more accommodating space like McIntire Park had nothing to do with the content of the demonstrators’ speech.","Alt-right activists held torches and marched late Friday through the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer released a statement referring to Friday’s rally as a “cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights.”

“Everyone has a right under the First Amendment to express their opinion peaceably, so here’s mine: not only as the Mayor of Charlottesville, but as a UVA faculty member and alumnus, I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus,” he added.

University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan said law enforcement is investigating the “intolerable” violence displayed on the campus.

“I strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including University personnel who were attempting to maintain order,” she said in a statement. “Law enforcement continues to investigate the incident, and it is my hope that any individuals responsible for criminal acts are held accountable.”

Friday’s rally took place shortly after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction allowing alt-right activists to hold Saturday’s “Unite the Right” event in Emancipation Park around the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

Earlier this week, city officials had tried to “modify” the rally’s permit to move the demonstration more than a mile away to McIntire Park, citing safety concerns associated with the number of people expected to attend the rally and counter protests.

Jason Kessler, who organized the “Unite the Right” rally, filed a lawsuit Thursday claiming the city’s intentions will violate free speech rights.

“While the City is disappointed by tonight’s ruling we will abide by the judge’s decision,” the city said in a statement late Friday. “The goal in moving the Unite the Right Rally from Emancipation Park to a larger, more accommodating space like McIntire Park had nothing to do with the content of the demonstrators’ speech.","Alt-right activists held torches and marched late Friday through the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville.

Alt-right activists held torches and marched late Friday through the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville.

Chanting “blood and soil” and “one people, one nation, end immigration,” the group rallied around a statue of Thomas Jefferson before they clashed with counterprotesters, CNN affiliate WWBT reported.

The march came hours before a Saturday rally that police anticipate will attract as many as 2,000 to 6,000 people, in an event that could be the “largest hate-gathering of it’s kind in decades in the United States,” as described by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Ty Cobb, special counsel to the President, said he wasn’t aware that Mueller had started using a new grand jury. “Grand jury matters are typically secret,” Mr. Cobb said. “The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly… The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.” Trump ignored shouted questions about Mueller as he departed the White House on Thursday afternoon. Smiling and waving, Trump walked from the Oval Office to his Marine One helicopter on a sunny August afternoon.

“The grand jury, which began its work in recent weeks, signals that Mr. Mueller’s inquiry will likely continue for months,” The Wall Street Journal says. “It is unclear how long Mr. Mueller’s investigation will last, and there is no deadline for its completion.

The judge’s ruling sparked a pre-rally march Friday night on the University of Virginia campus, resulting in clashes between marchers, protesters and police.

The unrest prompted Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, to place National Guard members on standby, and encourage Virginians to stay away from Saturday’s event.

“Men and women from state and local agencies will be in Charlottesville [on Saturday] to keep the public safe,” McAuliffe said in a statement, “and their job will be made easier if Virginians, no matter how well-meaning, elect to stay away from the areas where this rally will take place.”

On Friday night, marchers holding tiki torches and chanting “White lives matter!” in front of a statue of university founder Thomas Jefferson were confronted by protesters, the Washington Post reported.

After fights broke out, police dispersed the crowd, claiming it was an unlawful assembly, Richmond’s WTRV-TV reported.

Saturday’s event is scheduled for Emancipation Park after U.S. District Judge Glen Conrad issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit that right-wing blogger and rally organizer Jason Kessler filed against the city of Charlottesville.

Kessler wants to protest Charlottesville’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park. He sued the city over free speech violations after the officials ordered the rally moved from Emancipation Park to a larger venue because of safety concerns.

In a statement, the city said it would honor the judge’s decision. Kessler is being represented in his case by the Rutherford Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia.

The group waved torches and chanted ""White lives matter"" as they marched through the Charlottesville university.

There were clashes with counter-protesters, while the local mayor condemned the march as racist and a ""parade of hatred"".

A larger ""Unite the Right"" rally is planned in the city on Saturday.

The protesters are angered at the planned removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee from Charlottesville. Lee commanded forces of the pro-slavery Confederacy in the US Civil War.

Protest organiser Jason Kessler, who has previously accused the town of ""anti-white hatred"", described the event as an ""incredible moment for white people who've had it up to here and aren't going to take it anymore"".

The New York Times and Washington Post reported that the crowd chanted ""You will not replace us"" and ""Jew will not replace us"" during the event.

Demonstrators held lit torches - which some observers described as a reference to the Ku Klux Klan - and chanted ""blood and soil"" and ""one people, one nation, end immigration"".

The rally was met by a smaller group of counter protesters who had surrounded the university's statue of Thomas Jefferson, holding a banner that read ""VA Students Act Against White Supremacy"".","The local mayor called the torch-lit protest ""a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry and racism""."

The violence prompted the governor of Virginia to declare a state of emergency in the city and halt the white nationalist rally.

The clashes saw a car ploughing into a group of counter-protesters, approximately two hours after a violent confrontation between white nationalists and counter-demonstrators at a park.

Several hundred protesters were marching in a long line when the car drove into a group of them, sending people flying into the air.

Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said counter-protesters were marching when “suddenly there was just this tyre-screeching sound”.

He said a silver vehicle smashed into another car, then backed up, ploughing through “a sea of people”.

The University of Virginia health systems received 20 patients from the scene near the car incident.

One of those people died and 19 were being treated, a spokeswoman said.

The driver of the car has been taken into custody, USA Today reported, citing the state’s secretary of public safety.

“I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here,” Charlottesville mayor Mike Singer said on his Twitter feed. “I urge all people of good will - go home.”

The nationalists were holding the Unite the Right rally in protest over plans by Charlottesville to remove a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee from Emancipation Park.

Earlier on Saturday, the governor of Virginia declared the state of emergency amid mid-morning clashes ahead of the official rally that left several people injured.

Terry McAuliffe said on Twitter that the declaration had been made in order “to aid state response to violence” in the city.

The city’s mayor also declared a local emergency and local police issued an unlawful assembly alert.

Officials had approved the white nationalist protest march in downtown Charlottesville, but cancelled the event after the outbreaks of violence.

US president Donald Trump condemned the violence on Twitter.

“We must ALL be united & condemn all that hate stands for,” Trump tweeted. “There is no place for this kind of violence in America.”

Later on Saturday, Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf course: “We’re closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia.

“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.”

However, Mr Signer said he was disgusted that the white nationalists had come to his city and blamed Trump for inflaming racial prejudices with his election campaign last year.

He said: “I’m not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you’re seeing in America today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.”

Some had predicted the rally in the city could be the largest white nationalist demonstration in the US in years.

The clashes on Saturday morning saw supporters of the rally fighting with counter-demonstrators at Emancipation Park, with water bottles hurled from both sides and chemical sprays also being used.

The rally was supposed to start at noon local time, but the scene had grown chaotic by late morning, as white nationalists and neo-Nazis faced off with Black Lives Matter demonstrators and other counter-protesters.

Men dressed in military-style uniforms were seen carrying rifles and shields in the area.

At least eight people were injured and one person was arrested following those clashes.

The organiser of the rally, right-wing blogger Jason Kessler, encouraged attendees to leave town after authorities declared an unlawful assembly and police ordered people to disperse.

He told the Associated Press that he and other people who were going to speak at the event evacuated with security when police issued the order to disperse.

He said he wants rally attendees to leave town peacefully.

Prominent alt-right activist Richard Spencer, who was scheduled to speak at the event, said he was also encouraging people to go home.

Far-right monitoring groups estimated that between 500 and 1,000 people and 30 speakers and groups were due to descend on the downtown area for the event.

Those attending the event were to hear speeches from leading “alt-right” ideologues including the podcaster Mike Peinovich, aka “Mike Enoch”, and Matthew Heimbach, leader of the Traditionalist Worker Party.

Spencer Sunshine, who wrote a report for Political Research Associates assessing the rally, said: “This is a national gathering that the far-right have been planning for months. It’s their big event.”

He said that, far from being a broad slice of the right as planned, due to the reluctance of some “patriot movement” groups to attend, and the commitment of groups such as the National Socialist Movement to the event, “it’s become increasingly Nazified over the last few weeks”.

Local demonstrators and anti-racist activists from all over the country co-ordinated a counter-protest, which they hoped would dwarf the far-right event.

One group, Congregate Charlottesville, had called for 1,000 faith leaders, and “white clergy, especially”, to assemble for a nonviolent protest. Among those who responded was the intellectual and activist Cornel West, who led a prayer vigil on Friday night, ahead of the rally.

Another group, SolidarityCville, issued a call in late July to “all anti-racists” to come to Charlottesville to oppose the rally, adding that “we must outnumber them in order to #DefendCville”.

“Black Lives Matter and SURJ (Showing up for Racial Justice) chapters will also be opposing the rally.”

These calls have been amplified on a range of other progressive and anti-fascist websites.

On Friday night, hundreds of far-right demonstrators wielded torches as they marched on to the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville and reportedly attacked a much smaller group of counter-protesters who had linked arms around a statue of Thomas Jefferson.

The counter-protesters said they were attacked with swung torches, pepper spray and lighter fluid.

Two male protesters who said they were maced, and did not wish to be named, described far-right protesters moving from verbal abuse, to pushing and shoving protesters, to the noxious spray.

“Someone from the alt-right maced me right in the face - unprovoked,” said one.

“After they maced people they started punching people and hitting them with torches.” Several protesters said a woman using a wheelchair was among those sprayed.

On Friday afternoon, police reportedly attended the car park of the city’s Walmart, where they spoke with a Unite the Right speaker, Christopher Cantwell, after they received a report of someone brandishing a gun.

At the same time, police were supervising the construction of barricades about the 20ft-statue of Lee, which has been at the centre of other recent confrontations in Charlottesville.

In February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high-school student, Zyahna Bryant.

Terry McAuliffe said.

One of those killed was a 32-year-old female pedestrian who was hit by a car that plowed into marchers, authorities said. The driver of the car, James Alex Fields is being held on charges including second degree murder. Police say he's from Ohio.

A short time after the violence erupted, a police helicopter crashed, killing two troopers. Virginia State Police said the helicopter was assisting law enforcement officers monitoring the rally, according to The Associated Press. The officers killed were Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Va. and trooper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates, 40 of Quinton, Va.

Virginia State Police posted on Facebook that the helicopter crash in Albemarle County, where Charlottesville is located, occurred at approximately 5 p.m.

Gov. McAuliffe, speaking at a press conference, had a strong message for the white nationalist protesters: ""Go home.""

He added, ""You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. Shame on you. You pretend that you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.""

In video posted to Twitter, a silver car with darkened windows can be seen speeding through the crowd and ramming another vehicle, sending people through the air. The car then goes into reverse while marchers chase it.

Police said the afternoon crash happened near the intersection of Fourth and Water streets.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer tweeted that one person had died in that crash.

Warning: The video in the tweet below is graphic.

Photos and video show multiple people being treated for injuries, and police can be seen securing the scene of the wreck.

The crash involved three cars and, in addition to the fatality, at least nine people were injured, according to the AP.

In a statement sandwiched between announcing and signing legislation to expand a veterans health care program, the president said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.""

""We have to respect each other, ideally we have to love each other,"" he said.

Virginia's governor had earlier declared a state of emergency as a result of violent clashes involving hundreds of protesters in Charlottesville.

The move came during a white nationalist rally planned in the small college town to protest plans to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a city park. On Saturday morning, protesters and counterprotesters faced off, kicking, punching, hurling water bottles at and deploying chemical sprays against one another.

Approximately 500 protesters were on-site, with more than double the amount of counterprotesters, according to reporter Sandy Hausman of member station WVTF and Radio IQ. She said some injuries had been reported.

Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd, before offering protesters the option of being arrested or moving to another, larger location approximately 1 mile away, she told NPR's Scott Simon on Weekend Edition Saturday.

The declaration by Gov. McAuliffe was made in order to ""aid state response to violence"" at the rally in the city about 120 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., and home to the University of Virginia. The city's manager also declared a local emergency and police ordered people to disperse from the area around the statue, according to the AP.

The ""Unite the Right"" rally was expected to draw a lot of people from out of town. It follows last month's Ku Klux Klan rally, also in Charlottesville, that drew about 50 Klan members and about 1,000 counterprotesters.

After the violent outbursts, politicians tweeted their disdain at the events in Charlottesville. Trump called on Americans to ""come together as one.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan said the views of the white nationalists were ""repugnant"" and called for Americans to unite against ""this kind of vile bigotry.""

First lady Melania Trump called for people to ""communicate [without] hate in our hearts.""

In an odd side story, many of the white nationalist marchers were seen holding signs featuring the logo of the Detroit Red Wings, a historic hockey franchise in the NHL.

An anti-immigrant group called the Detroit Right Wings features a similar logo. A Twitter account that seemed to represent the group tweeted earlier in the week about attending Saturday's rally.

As images of marchers flaunting the logo began flooding social media, the team issued a swift statement in response.

""The Detroit Red Wings vehemently disagree with and are not associated in any way with the event taking place today in Charlottesville,"" the team said. ""We are exploring every possible legal action as it pertains to the misuse of our logo in this disturbing demonstration.""

NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly added in an email to the AP, ""This specific use is particularly offensive because it runs counter to the inclusiveness that our league values and champions.""

The clashes began Friday night, when far-right protesters carrying torches descended on the University of Virginia campus.

In a Facebook post about that march, Mayor Signer wrote, ""I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.""

In the days leading up to Saturday's planned rally, there had been some back-and-forth about where it would be held.

The AP reported that a federal judge ordered Charlottesville to allow the rally to take place at its originally planned location downtown:

""U.S. District Judge Glen Conrad issued a preliminary injunction Friday in a lawsuit filed against Charlottesville by right-wing blogger Jason Kessler.

""The city announced earlier this week that the rally must be moved out of Emancipation Park to a larger one, citing safety reasons.

""Kessler sued, saying the change was a free speech violation. The judge wrote that Kessler was likely to prevail and granted the injunction.""

After the ruling, The New York Times reported:

""Late Friday night, several hundred torch-bearing men and women marched on the main quadrangle of the University of Virginia's grounds, shouting, 'You will not replace us,' and 'Jew will not replace us.' They walked around the Rotunda, the university's signature building, and to a statue of Thomas Jefferson, where a group of counterprotesters were gathered, and a brawl ensued.""

""As President of the University of Virginia, I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behavior displayed by torch-bearing protestors that marched on our Grounds this evening. I strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including University personnel who were attempting to maintain order.

""Law enforcement continues to investigate the incident, and it is my hope that any individuals responsible for criminal acts are held accountable. The violence displayed on Grounds is intolerable and is entirely inconsistent with the University's values.""

City officials and police say they are prepared for any violence. Gov. McAuliffe urged Virginians to stay away from the rally and placed the National Guard on standby. The guard released a statement saying it would ""closely monitor the situation.""

Earlier this week, All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro reported on Airbnb's decision to make it harder for people attending the rally to find places to stay. The company canceled the accounts of people it confirmed had used its platform to book lodging for the event. It says those people defy its community standards. Rally organizers say this should be grounds for a lawsuit.

Debate over the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville began when an African-American high school student started a petition more than a year ago to have it removed. Lee, who was born in Virginia, commanded Confederate forces in the Civil War from 1862 until he surrendered in 1865.

More than 100 white nationalists, neo-Confederates, and alt-right activists marched with Tiki torches through the university’s lawn and the Rotunda.

Marchers were heard chanting “white lives matter” while gathered at the Thomas Jefferson statue. That’s when the marchers were reportedly met with counter protesters.

Things turned violent after physical fights between marches and protesters erupted, Joe Heim with the Washington Post reported.

When police arrived to the scene they ruled that the march was an unlawful assembly and shut down the torch rally. There is no word on any arrests or injuries.

The torch rally was held after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction, allowing Saturday’s rally at Emancipation Park to proceed.

CBS 6 will have live coverage on that rally on air and on WTVR.com.

Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe urged Virginians to stay away in a statement released hours before a planned “Unite the Right” rally that could bring thousands of white nationalists, neo-Confederates, alt-right activists, and counter protesters to Charlottesville.

“In advance of [Saturday’s] rally there have been communications from extremist groups, many of which are located outside of Virginia, who may seek to commit acts of violence against rally participants or law enforcement officials.

“In the event that such violent or unlawful conduct occurs, I have instructed state public safety officials to act quickly and decisively in order to keep the public and themselves safe,” Governor McAuliffe’s statement read. “I want to urge my fellow Virginians who may consider joining either in support or opposition to the planned rally to make alternative plans.

“Many of the individuals coming to Charlottesville are doing so in order to express viewpoints many people, including me, find abhorrent.

“As long as that expression is peaceful, that is their right. But it is also the right of every American to deny those ideas more attention than they deserve.

“Men and women from state and local agencies will be in Charlottesville tomorrow to keep the public safe, and their job will be made easier if Virginians, no matter how well-meaning, elect to stay away from the areas where this rally will take place.”

The governor said Virginia State Police would handle police planning and response for rally and that the Virginia National Guard was on stand by if needed.

Saturday’s event after a Ku Klux Klan rally in July drew about 50 Klan members and supporters who gathered around a statue of Confederate Lt. Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson.

Marchers were heard chanting “white lives matter” while gathered at the Thomas Jefferson statue. That’s when the marchers were reportedly met with counter protesters.

Things turned violent after physical fights between marches and protesters erupted, Joe Heim with the Washington Post reported.

When police arrived to the scene they ruled that the march was an unlawful assembly and shut down the torch rally. There is no word on any arrests or injuries.

The torch rally was held after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction, allowing Saturday’s rally at Emancipation Park to proceed.

CBS 6 will have live coverage on that rally on air and on WTVR.com.

Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe urged Virginians to stay away in a statement released hours before a planned “Unite the Right” rally that could bring thousands of white nationalists, neo-Confederates, alt-right activists, and counter protesters to Charlottesville.

“In advance of [Saturday’s] rally there have been communications from extremist groups, many of which are located outside of Virginia, who may seek to commit acts of violence against rally participants or law enforcement officials.

“In the event that such violent or unlawful conduct occurs, I have instructed state public safety officials to act quickly and decisively in order to keep the public and themselves safe,” Governor McAuliffe’s statement read. “I want to urge my fellow Virginians who may consider joining either in support or opposition to the planned rally to make alternative plans.

“Many of the individuals coming to Charlottesville are doing so in order to express viewpoints many people, including me, find abhorrent.

“As long as that expression is peaceful, that is their right. But it is also the right of every American to deny those ideas more attention than they deserve.

“Men and women from state and local agencies will be in Charlottesville tomorrow to keep the public safe, and their job will be made easier if Virginians, no matter how well-meaning, elect to stay away from the areas where this rally will take place.”

The governor said Virginia State Police would handle police planning and response for rally and that the Virginia National Guard was on stand by if needed.

Saturday’s event after a Ku Klux Klan rally in July drew about 50 Klan members and supporters who gathered around a statue of Confederate Lt. Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson.

After recent incidents at Smith Mountain Lake, officials are talking water safety.

WDBJ7 has been told by the Smith Mountain Lake Marine Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad that there has been an uptick in the number, and severity, of incidents in just the last few weeks.

That includes two drownings, one of which involved a 9-year-old playing on a floating trampoline.

Two teens were also seriously hurt when their jet-skis collided.

The rescue squad says people falling from decks and docks has been an issue as well.

WDBJ7 asked Bedford County Fire and Rescue officials how you can stay safe.

""Life jackets really for everybody. I know it's required for kids, not required for all adults. But you can't go wrong wearing a life jacket,” Bedford County Fire Marshal Jeff Pauley said.

Another tip: avoid alcohol anywhere near the water.

Officials say water and alcohol do not mix.

Above all things be aware and alert of people in your group and your surroundings.

If you see a problem call 911 first, then try to help with things like CPR.

Pauley says there are a few things you can do before you go out on the water to keep yourself, and others, safe.

""Certainly safe boating classes are important, they're required for almost any operator in Virginia, there might be a couple of exceptions. You can't beat swimming lessons, and you can't beat CPR lessons,"" Pauley said.","WDBJ7 has been told by the Smith Mountain Lake Marine Volunteer Fire Rescue Squad that there has been an uptick in the number, and severity, of incidents in just the last few weeks."

Far-right monitoring groups estimate that between 500 and 1,000 people and 30 speakers and groups will descend on the downtown area for the afternoon event, organised by the local rightwing activist and former Daily Caller writer Jason Kessler.

Those attending the Unite the Right event will hear speeches from leading “alt-right” ideologues including Richard Spencer, the podcaster Mike Peinovich, AKA “Mike Enoch”, and Matthew Heimbach, leader of the Traditionalist Workers party.

There was a confrontation late Friday ahead of the main rally when protesters and a smaller group of counter protesters came together on the University of Virginia campus. When the marchers reached and surrounded the counter-protesters there was a short verbal confrontation. Counter-protesters said they were then attacked with swung torches, pepper spray and lighter fluid.

Speaking earlier, Spencer Sunshine, who wrote a report for Political Research Associates assessing Saturday’s rally, said: “This is a national gathering that the far right have been planning for months. It’s their big event.”

He said far from being a broad slice of the right as planned, with the reluctance of some “patriot movement” groups to attend, and the commitment of groups such as the National Socialist Movement to the event, “it’s become increasingly Nazified over the last few weeks”.

In response, local demonstrators and anti-racist activists from all over the country are coordinating a counter-protest, which they are hoping will dwarf the far-right event.

One group, Congregate Charlottesville, has called for 1,000 faith leaders, and “white clergy, especially”, to assemble for a nonviolent protest. Among those who have responded is the intellectual and activist Cornel West, who led a prayer vigil on Friday night, ahead of the rally.

Another group, SolidarityCville, issued a call in late July to “all anti-racists” to come to Charlottesville to oppose the event, adding that “we must outnumber them in order to #DefendCville”.

“Black Lives Matter and SURJ (Showing up for Racial Justice) chapters will also be opposing the rally.”



These calls have been amplified on a range of other progressive and antifascist websites.

Far-right activists have raised the prospect that the confrontation could turn violent. Discussing so-called “antifa” groups on his podcast The Right Stuff this week, Mike Peinovich said: “We don’t want those people to have the impression that we are going to show up unarmed.”

Emily Gorcenski, a local activist who is involved in organizing the #defendcville protests, said in an interview: “I don’t want violence, we don’t want violence, that’s not our MO. We want to be able to demonstrate against their message and assert our civil rights.”

But she also said that she had had 100 death threats in the last month, and was herself open-carrying a weapon for self-defense. “The second amendment is one of the few civil rights I have left as a trans woman.”

On Friday afternoon, police reportedly attended the carpark of the city’s Walmart, where they spoke with a Unite the Right speaker, Christopher Cantwell, after they received a report of someone brandishing a gun.

At the same time, police were supervising the construction of barricades around a 20ft-statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee, which is the focus of the rally, and has been at the centre of other recent confrontations in Charlottesville.

In February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.

This is part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.

In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by around 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan’s departure, and made 23 arrests.

Saturday’s rally is expected to go ahead in Emancipation Park despite the city’s attempts to relocate it to McIntire Park, which is outside the central downtown area. Organizers and the ACLU were challenging the city’s right to relocate the rally, and on Twitter Friday, Jason Kessler was insisting it would go ahead in what he was still calling “Lee Park”.

The Charlottesville mayor, Michael Signer, and the University of Virginia president, Teresa Sullivan, each issued statements urging people to avoid the rally.

Around the city starting on Thursday evening, flyers appeared bearing the slogan “Diversity is a code word for white genocide”, a common white nationalist trope.

The governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, in a statement urged residents to stay away. He said: “I want to urge my fellow Virginians who may consider joining either in support or opposition to the planned rally to make alternative plans.

Far-right monitoring groups estimate that between 500 and 1,000 people and 30 speakers and groups will descend on the downtown area for the afternoon event, organised by the local rightwing activist and former Daily Caller writer Jason Kessler.

Those attending the Unite the Right event will hear speeches from leading “alt-right” ideologues including Richard Spencer, the podcaster Mike Peinovich, AKA “Mike Enoch”, and Matthew Heimbach, leader of the Traditionalist Workers party.

There was a confrontation late Friday ahead of the main rally when protesters and a smaller group of counter protesters came together on the University of Virginia campus. When the marchers reached and surrounded the counter-protesters there was a short verbal confrontation. Counter-protesters said they were then attacked with swung torches, pepper spray and lighter fluid.

Speaking earlier, Spencer Sunshine, who wrote a report for Political Research Associates assessing Saturday’s rally, said: “This is a national gathering that the far right have been planning for months. It’s their big event.”

He said far from being a broad slice of the right as planned, with the reluctance of some “patriot movement” groups to attend, and the commitment of groups such as the National Socialist Movement to the event, “it’s become increasingly Nazified over the last few weeks”.

In response, local demonstrators and anti-racist activists from all over the country are coordinating a counter-protest, which they are hoping will dwarf the far-right event.

One group, Congregate Charlottesville, has called for 1,000 faith leaders, and “white clergy, especially”, to assemble for a nonviolent protest. Among those who have responded is the intellectual and activist Cornel West, who led a prayer vigil on Friday night, ahead of the rally.

Another group, SolidarityCville, issued a call in late July to “all anti-racists” to come to Charlottesville to oppose the event, adding that “we must outnumber them in order to #DefendCville”.

“Black Lives Matter and SURJ (Showing up for Racial Justice) chapters will also be opposing the rally.”



These calls have been amplified on a range of other progressive and antifascist websites.

Far-right activists have raised the prospect that the confrontation could turn violent. Discussing so-called “antifa” groups on his podcast The Right Stuff this week, Mike Peinovich said: “We don’t want those people to have the impression that we are going to show up unarmed.”

Emily Gorcenski, a local activist who is involved in organizing the #defendcville protests, said in an interview: “I don’t want violence, we don’t want violence, that’s not our MO. We want to be able to demonstrate against their message and assert our civil rights.”

But she also said that she had had 100 death threats in the last month, and was herself open-carrying a weapon for self-defense. “The second amendment is one of the few civil rights I have left as a trans woman.”

On Friday afternoon, police reportedly attended the carpark of the city’s Walmart, where they spoke with a Unite the Right speaker, Christopher Cantwell, after they received a report of someone brandishing a gun.

At the same time, police were supervising the construction of barricades around a 20ft-statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee, which is the focus of the rally, and has been at the centre of other recent confrontations in Charlottesville.

In February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.

This is part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.

In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by around 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan’s departure, and made 23 arrests.

Saturday’s rally is expected to go ahead in Emancipation Park despite the city’s attempts to relocate it to McIntire Park, which is outside the central downtown area. Organizers and the ACLU were challenging the city’s right to relocate the rally, and on Twitter Friday, Jason Kessler was insisting it would go ahead in what he was still calling “Lee Park”.

The brawl at the University of Virginia came ahead of a much larger rally planned for Saturday, when thousands are expected for what monitors described as the ""largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the US"". The “alt-Right” demonstrators gathered late on Friday and chanted “blood and soil” and “one people, one nation, end immigration” as they carried burning torches through the university campus.

“Blood and soil” was a phrase commonly used by the Nazis to hail their ideas about racial superiority and traditional rural life. The mostly male crowd marched through the empty campus in Charlottesville and rallied around a statue of Thomas Jefferson, who designed the university’s grounds. There they clashed with a small group of counter-protesters, who had linked arms around the statue. Several people were injured as punches were exchanged and pepper-spray was fired. Mike Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, called the white nationalist march “a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights”. Larry Sabato, a professor at the university, said it was “the most nauseating thing I've ever seen” in his 47 years of being associated with the university.

The torch lit scenes on the university campus may be only a foreshadowing of the much larger demonstrations expected on Saturday at the Unite the Right rally - which is expected to bring together different factions of the alt-Right. Police expect that between 2,000 and 6,000 demonstrators will gather in Emancipation Park around a statue of Robert E Lee, a Confederate general during the American Civil War. White nationalist protesters have angrily opposed plans to take down statues of Lee and other Confederate figures who fought for the cause of slavery during the war.

The demonstrators accuse local governments of trying to erase history by removing the statues and often chant “you will not replace us” as they rally around the statues. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that tracks extremist organisations in the US, said that Saturday’s rally may be the ""largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the US"". The city of Charlottesville had tried to get the protest moved to another park but the rally organisers sued and a judge ruled they must be allowed in Emancipation Park. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a civil liberties group, supported the nationalist demonstrators in their suit, saying that freedom of speech “applies equally to everyone regardless of their views”.",Hundreds of white supremacists carrying burning torches and chanting Nazi-era slogans rallied in Virginia on Friday night before violently clashing with counter-protesters.

The time has finally come: Barack Obama is about to publicly get back into politics.

The former president may have spent the beginning of this year on vacation, but he and his aides are planning his return to the Democratic Party this fall, The Hill reported Friday. And even though many of his efforts will center on fundraising and campaigning for people like Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam, experts say Obama needs to be careful with Donald Trump.

""He would be the target against which Trump would direct his fury,"" Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson told The Hill. ""From Trump's perspective, nothing better could happen.""

Indeed, Trump is not likely to welcome Obama's comeback. The current commander in chief can't stop talking about his predecessor. Earlier this week, after a Washington Post report indicated North Korea was expanding its nuclear capabilities, Trump retweeted a message from former U.S. ambassador John Bolton saying that ""our country & civilians are vulnerable today because @BarackObama did not believe in national missile defense. Let's never forget that."" He also retweeted an unofficial poll asking who was a better president.

""This president has a very unusual obsession with his predecessor and constantly comparing himself to President Obama,"" Obama-era Assistant Defense Secretary Derek Chollet told CNN. ""This is not a president who seems to be singularly focused on what is a genuinely a global security threat in North Korea.""

Part of this may have to do with Trump's poll numbers. His approval ratings have been slipping for months, recently hitting 37 percent. Obama left office at 59 percent, according to Gallup.

Since he moved out of the White House, Obama has spoken out a couple of times against Trump and his policies. In January, for example, a spokesman for the ex-president issued a statement opposing Trump's travel ban. In June, Obama denounced Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.

Nobody quite knows what Obama will do going forward to help the Democratic Party, which suffered from division during the primaries before losing the general election last year. The former president has reportedly been taking meetings with lawmakers in the House and Senate, as well as Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, but he's previously said he wants to help develop ""a whole new generation of talent"" that could revitalize the group.

A Manafort spokesman confirmed the search Wednesday.

Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said in a statement that FBI agents had obtained a warrant and searched one of Manafort's homes, but he would not say when the search occurred or what it was for.

""Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well,"" Maloni said.

The Associated Press has learned the warrant for the search on July 26 at Manafort's home in Alexandria, Virginia, sought information including tax documents and banking records. The Washington Post first reported the raid.

Manafort has been a subject of a longstanding FBI investigation into his dealings in Ukraine and work for the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. That investigation has been incorporated into the probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also scrutinizing Manafort's role in the Trump campaign as he looks into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with Trump associates.

Manafort, who led the Trump campaign for several months, has denied any wrongdoing. He also spoke behind closed doors to Senate investigators for an interview just one day before the search of his home.

The use of a search warrant indicates that law enforcement officials have convinced a judge there is probable cause to believe a crime may have been committed. A house raid can be seen as an aggressive tactic given that Manafort has been cooperating with congressional investigators and has turned over hundreds of pages of documents. It could indicate law enforcement was looking for records beyond what Manafort provided.

Word of the raid is the latest revelation about Mueller's investigation, which had been operating in relative secrecy compared with numerous congressional probes looking at the election. In recent days, it's become clear the former FBI director is using a grand jury in Washington in addition to one in the Eastern District of Virginia, where investigators also have been looking into former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Also, FBI agents have been asking witnesses since the spring about $530,000 worth of lobbying and investigative work carried out by Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, according to a person familiar with the investigation. That work sought the extradition of an exiled Turkish cleric living in the U.S. Through his attorney, Flynn has declined to comment on the investigation.

The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive details of the investigation, said FBI agents have also been asking about Flynn's business partner, Bijan Kian, who served on the Trump presidential transition . Kian has not responded to multiple attempts to contact him over several months.

In recent months, Flynn and Manafort have turned over documents to congressional committees investigating the election interference.

One focus of the multiple probes, including Mueller's, is a June 2016 meeting Manafort attended with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump Jr. That meeting, held at Trump Tower in New York, was described to Trump Jr. in emails as part of a Russian government effort to help the Trump campaign by passing along information that could be used against Democrat Hillary Clinton.

During his Senate intelligence committee interview , Manafort provided his recollection of the Trump Tower meeting and turned over contemporaneous notes he took during the gathering. The interview was confined to that meeting.

Manafort has also turned over other documents to the Senate intelligence committee as well as about 400 pages of records to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Meanwhile, the Judiciary Committee said Wednesday it has also received about 250 pages of documents from Trump Jr. and about 20,000 pages from the Trump campaign.

The content of the documents was not immediately clear. The committee said it received the Manafort and Trump campaign documents on Aug. 2 and the records from Trump Jr. on Aug. 4.

Judiciary committee leaders have also been in talks with Trump Jr. and Manafort about private interviews. The committee initially called for them to testify publicly, but lawmakers have since said they were negotiating the terms of their appearances.","FBI agents looking for financial documents have searched one of the homes of President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, whose past foreign political work has been swept into the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

As we reported earlier this morning, alt-right, anti-progressive, Ku Klux Klan / Nazi-fueled nationalists gathered at Emancipation Park to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.

Thousands of white nationalist terrorists, as well as groups that oppose them, were seen in images and on television beating each other with sticks, bats, brass knuckles, while carrying fully loaded assault weapons. Two people have been treated for serious, but not life-threatening injuries, according to Charlottesville officials.

Former KKK leader David Duke was also in attendance in Charlottesville. He called the rally a turning point, saying that protesters would fulfill the promises of President Donald Drumpf.

Protesters have already drawn the ire from leaders within the community. Mike Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, called the demonstrations by white terrorists a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism and intolerance. UVA president Teresa A. Sullivan also condemned the unprovoked assault on members of our community. With the president, better known as Quicker Twitter Fingers, not saying anything on the matter his silence speaks loudly on the events in Charlottesville.

Hundreds of white nationalists and white supremacistsgathered in protest at the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia on Fridaynight.

The crowd was bearing torches similar to the KKK and chanting phrases like ""blood and soil"" and ""one people, one nation, end immigration"" and ""white lives matter."" This march comes a day before the Unite the Right rally, a gathering expected to attract thousands of people. The Unite the Right will be held on Saturday at noon at Emancipation Park, where a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee stands. (Earlier this year the city of Charlottesville voted to remove the statue.)

The makeshift march started at around 9:30 pm and lasted about 20 minutes before a group of people against the protesters showed up and a fight broke. According to the Washington Post, one of the anti-protesters threw some kind of chemical agent that affected the eyes of some of the white supremacists.

After the incident, Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer wrote a message on Facebook against the demonstration, calling it a ""cowardly parade of hatred:""

University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan also released a statement, saying she was deeply saddened and disturbed by what happened:

Chilling images and videos of the night traveled all around Twitter. Here is a snapshot of what happened.","White nationalists have beaten and terrorized anti-alt-right protesters, leaving Virginia's governor no choice but to declare a state of emergency."

One young man from the South Country School District in Bellport has been rounded up and sent miles from home to Virginia, far from his terrified mother, who barely speaks English — all because he made a hand gesture in the hallway at school, his attorney Peter Brill said.

MS-13 members, Trump said, are brutally violent. ""They don't like shooting people because it's too quick, it's too fast,"" he said. Instead, they ""knife them, cut them, let them die slowly because it's more painful. These guys are animals."" Suffolk County has become the epicenter of an international effort to battle escalating MS-13 violence after the gruesome discovery of four bodies in Central Islip on Long Island in April — the four young men are believed to have been victims of the deadly MS-13 street gang — as lawmakers, educators and a horrified public try to shine a light on MS-13 and seek answers on how to stem the tide of murder and crime.

But while civil rights activists say they understand the need to eradicate MS-13, their concern is for the young people who are swept up with gang members unfairly, simply because they may have been wearing the wrong T- shirt or used a hand gesture that was incorrectly surmised to mean the teen was an MS-13 gang member. As many as nine teens, ranging in age from 14 to 17, may have been unfairly targeted so far across Suffolk County, reports indicate. The end result said Irma Solis, director of the NYCLU's Suffolk County Chapter, is a blanket of terror enveloping immigrant communities across Long Island. ""Parents are very scared,"" she said. While Sister Margaret Smyth of the North Fork Apostolate in Riverhead said there have been no major U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, to her knowledge in Suffolk County, Solis said that doesn't mean ICE isn't sparking a backlash of fear.

""They are doing it in a very subtle and a very individual way,"" Solis said. ""ICE is coming to folks' homes, stopping them on their way to work. We have had young boys who have been suspended from schools and have had no criminal records or any contact with police — but somehow, that information reached ICE and ICE picked them up."" The NYCLU's concern is that students picked up by ICE have not been told they're on any kind of list and have thereby been unable to contest the situation or unfair MS-13 label, even if they personally are not gang members — those teens are being denied their due process rights, Solis said. ""We recognize that these communities have seen MS-13 violence and families have lost loved ones,"" Solis said. But having a teen picked up and unfairly detained, she said, has its own damaging impacts. ""We are also seeing families that are being separated. These kids are the collateral damage. Picked up and transferred many miles from their families and attorneys,"" Solis said. She added that ""given some of the allegations made by the schools,"" the teens were never told they were suspected of gang activity, and ""the evidence is not very strong. We speak to other students, and it seems like they were put on a list by speaking to someone who might be in a gang, or by wearing a shirt.""

The school districts in question, she said, include the South Country Central School District as well as some kids picked up in Huntington Station and Brentwood. Shining light on what's happening is critical, Solis said; the NYCLU has been seeking to interview students who have been suspended and then picked up by ICE. ""We want to make people aware that yes, there's MS-13 violence, but we're trying to make sure local law enforcement is going about it in a way that's going to promote safety — and not targeting particular individuals,"" Solis said. Unfair profiling has led to widespread fear in the community, with an immigrant community already unsure about speaking out even more afraid to reach out to local law enforcement if they have been threatened by gang members, Solis said. ""The community gets the idea that they don't have anywhere to turn,"" Solis said.

Local youth might be afraid to contact school officials or police if they know of gang activity — because they might be afraid doing so would mean they, too, would end up on a list, just for knowing a gang member, she said. The NYCLU, Solis said, has sent letters to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an entity that oversees the unaccompanied minors program, letting it know about the NYCLU's concerns and asking it to ""take a close look and conduct their own, independent investigation with respect to the allegations, to let them know that the way ICE is going about it is violating the Flores Settlement Agreement."" According to humanrightsfirst.org, in 1985, two organizations filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of immigrant children who had been detained by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS, ""challenging procedures regarding the detention, treatment, and release of children. After many years of litigation, including an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the parties reached a settlement in 1997."" That settlement imposed several obligations on the immigration authorities, including that the government is required to release children from immigration detention without unnecessary delay, to place them in the least restrictive setting if suitable placement is not immediately available, and that standards of care must be implemented, the site said.

While a climate of fear has existed for years in an immigrant community in shadows, ""once it became clear that the current administration was going to work with and collaborate with local law enforcement,"" an already existing fear of police has intensified, Solis said. People who already weren't feeling comfortable are now fearful that anyone arrested for a misdemeanor or felony could have their information shared with ICE, if officers believed the individuals were either engaged in gang activity or were in some way related to gang activity, Solis said. ""Once the word got out in the community, it created another level of fear,"" she said. In addition, the community is afraid Trump's administration might not only be looking at unaccompanied minors but also parents who had anything to do with bringing those young people to the United States.

""Parents are even more afraid, and can't talk about what's going on, because they're thinking, 'They could be coming for me,'"" Solis said. The NYCLU's stance is not to allow MS-13 gang members to continue acts of carnage, Solis said. ""Gang members should be stopped. That's very different. But what we are seeing is people who are just being labeled — and the consequences are dire,"" she said. The parents of some kids who may have been unfairly suspended or detained are afraid to send them back to school, Solis said. ""It's real. Parents are saying, 'We are fortunate to get our son back. I don't know that I want him to go back to a school where he's already been labeled and accused,'"" she said.

And for the kids detained, ripped from their families — Brill said there is one teen currently being held in Virginia — the experience is ""very traumatizing,"" Solis said. ""Remember — these are kids who've come from countries to escape violence."" Their families, she said, had to make the decision to send them away to flee danger — and so the idea of deportation puts the child once again in grave danger, Solis said. ""One mom said, If my son were deported back to our country, he runs a greater risk of having a gang come after him, because supposedly, he was deported because he was in a gang. Except, he isn't a gang member,"" Solis said. Attorney Brill said he's representing five teens, all between 16 and 19, and others have been picked up in Brentwood, he said. Only one right now, from the South Country School District in Bellport, is currently being detained in Virginia, Brill said.

What he's seeing, Brill said, is students suspended ""for doing something minor and stupid in school, at best,"" such as drawing graffiti on their locker or wearing a Chicago Bulls shirt to school — the shirt, he said, has horns, and ""police claim MS-13 symbols have horns, so it's gang related. From our kid's perspective, it was the only clean shirt in the house."" Teens targeted, Brill said, are ""hardly literate."" Growing up in Central America, they were not sent to school and may be behind in grade level. The teens, he said, were ""sent here because they were afraid for their lives, threatened by gang members in their own country."" After suspending the teens, schools consult with a Suffolk County Police officer assigned to the district to determine if the incident was ""gang related. What started out as school misconduct, at worst, has now placed them on a list shared with immigration,"" Brill said. The student currently being detained was one of two teens making the hand gestures, Brill added. ""I don't know why one gets picked up and the other one doesn't,"" Brill said. A school resource officer said the gesture was ""consistent"" with the hand gestures made by gang members, the lawyer added. The teen, 16, is detained pending a hearing. His mother is not well educated, barely speaks English, and does not understand the legal system or what is happening to her son, Brill said.

Sister Margaret Smyth, meanwhile, maintains that the immigrant community she works with through the North Fork Spanish Apostolate is not letting fear of ICE dictate their lives. ""Peope are walking into my office by the dozens, going to beaches, going to work,"" she said. ""It’s not enough to make them sit in the house and hide."" For those directly impacted by the quadruple homicide in Central Islip, the heartbreak is deeply personal.

The four young men found dead on the night of April 12 at Central Islip Recreation Village Park suffered trauma from a sharp-edged instrument. They were only 16, 18, 18 and 20 years old, their lives just beginning. One of the victims, Jorge Tigre, a Bellport High School honor student, was also not a gang member and allegedly became a target after he refused to associate with gang members following the murder of two girls in Brentwood, Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, who were murdered in September by MS-13 gang members with machetes, according to a Newsday report.

Thirteen MS-13 members were charged with seven murders, including those of Mickens and Cuevas, that occurred in Brentwood and Central Islip over the past several years. Tigre's sister Monica Tigre, in an interview with Patch, declined to discuss what may have led to her brother's murder but said she and her family are left with only memories. ""The only thing I can said he was a wonderful person. He was always smiling and helping my family and me. I will remember him — his smile and his kindness,"" Tigre said. Superintendent of Schools Dr. Joseph Giani of the South Country Central School District did not immediately return a call or email requesting comment.","""Gang members should be stopped. But what we are seeing is people who are just being labeled — and the consequences are dire."""

Shining light on what's happening is critical, Solis said; the NYCLU has been seeking to interview students who have been suspended and then picked up by ICE. ""We want to make people aware that yes, there's MS-13 violence, but we're trying to make sure local law enforcement is going about it in a way that's going to promote safety — and not targeting particular individuals,"" Solis said. Unfair profiling has led to widespread fear in the community, with an immigrant community already unsure about speaking out even more afraid to reach out to local law enforcement if they have been threatened by gang members, Solis said. ""The community gets the idea that they don't have anywhere to turn,"" Solis said.

Local youth might be afraid to contact school officials or police if they know of gang activity — because they might be afraid doing so would mean they, too, would end up on a list, just for knowing a gang member, she said. The NYCLU, Solis said, has sent letters to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an entity that oversees the unaccompanied minors program, letting it know about the NYCLU's concerns and asking it to ""take a close look and conduct their own, independent investigation with respect to the allegations, to let them know that the way ICE is going about it is violating the Flores Settlement Agreement."" According to humanrightsfirst.org, in 1985, two organizations filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of immigrant children who had been detained by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS, ""challenging procedures regarding the detention, treatment, and release of children. After many years of litigation, including an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the parties reached a settlement in 1997."" That settlement imposed several obligations on the immigration authorities, including that the government is required to release children from immigration detention without unnecessary delay, to place them in the least restrictive setting if suitable placement is not immediately available, and that standards of care must be implemented, the site said.

While a climate of fear has existed for years in an immigrant community in shadows, ""once it became clear that the current administration was going to work with and collaborate with local law enforcement,"" an already existing fear of police has intensified, Solis said. People who already weren't feeling comfortable are now fearful that anyone arrested for a misdemeanor or felony could have their information shared with ICE, if officers believed the individuals were either engaged in gang activity or were in some way related to gang activity, Solis said. ""Once the word got out in the community, it created another level of fear,"" she said. In addition, the community is afraid Trump's administration might not only be looking at unaccompanied minors but also parents who had anything to do with bringing those young people to the United States.

""Parents are even more afraid, and can't talk about what's going on, because they're thinking, 'They could be coming for me,'"" Solis said. The NYCLU's stance is not to allow MS-13 gang members to continue acts of carnage, Solis said. ""Gang members should be stopped. That's very different. But what we are seeing is people who are just being labeled — and the consequences are dire,"" she said. The parents of some kids who may have been unfairly suspended or detained are afraid to send them back to school, Solis said. ""It's real. Parents are saying, 'We are fortunate to get our son back. I don't know that I want him to go back to a school where he's already been labeled and accused,'"" she said.

And for the kids detained, ripped from their families — Brill said there is one teen currently being held in Virginia — the experience is ""very traumatizing,"" Solis said. ""Remember — these are kids who've come from countries to escape violence."" Their families, she said, had to make the decision to send them away to flee danger — and so the idea of deportation puts the child once again in grave danger, Solis said. ""One mom said, If my son were deported back to our country, he runs a greater risk of having a gang come after him, because supposedly, he was deported because he was in a gang. Except, he isn't a gang member,"" Solis said. Attorney Brill said he's representing five teens, all between 16 and 19, and others have been picked up in Brentwood, he said. Only one right now, from the South Country School District in Bellport, is currently being detained in Virginia, Brill said.

What he's seeing, Brill said, is students suspended ""for doing something minor and stupid in school, at best,"" such as drawing graffiti on their locker or wearing a Chicago Bulls shirt to school — the shirt, he said, has horns, and ""police claim MS-13 symbols have horns, so it's gang related. From our kid's perspective, it was the only clean shirt in the house."" Teens targeted, Brill said, are ""hardly literate."" Growing up in Central America, they were not sent to school and may be behind in grade level. The teens, he said, were ""sent here because they were afraid for their lives, threatened by gang members in their own country."" After suspending the teens, schools consult with a Suffolk County Police officer assigned to the district to determine if the incident was ""gang related. What started out as school misconduct, at worst, has now placed them on a list shared with immigration,"" Brill said. The student currently being detained was one of two teens making the hand gestures, Brill added. ""I don't know why one gets picked up and the other one doesn't,"" Brill said. A school resource officer said the gesture was ""consistent"" with the hand gestures made by gang members, the lawyer added. The teen, 16, is detained pending a hearing. His mother is not well educated, barely speaks English, and does not understand the legal system or what is happening to her son, Brill said.

Sister Margaret Smyth, meanwhile, maintains that the immigrant community she works with through the North Fork Spanish Apostolate is not letting fear of ICE dictate their lives. ""Peope are walking into my office by the dozens, going to beaches, going to work,"" she said. ""It’s not enough to make them sit in the house and hide."" For those directly impacted by the quadruple homicide in Central Islip, the heartbreak is deeply personal.

The four young men found dead on the night of April 12 at Central Islip Recreation Village Park suffered trauma from a sharp-edged instrument. They were only 16, 18, 18 and 20 years old, their lives just beginning. One of the victims, Jorge Tigre, a Bellport High School honor student, was also not a gang member and allegedly became a target after he refused to associate with gang members following the murder of two girls in Brentwood, Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, who were murdered in September by MS-13 gang members with machetes, according to a Newsday report.

Thirteen MS-13 members were charged with seven murders, including those of Mickens and Cuevas, that occurred in Brentwood and Central Islip over the past several years. Tigre's sister Monica Tigre, in an interview with Patch, declined to discuss what may have led to her brother's murder but said she and her family are left with only memories. ""The only thing I can said he was a wonderful person. He was always smiling and helping my family and me. I will remember him — his smile and his kindness,"" Tigre said.

One young man from the South Country School District in Bellport has been rounded up and sent miles from home to Virginia, far from his terrified mother, who barely speaks English — all because he made a hand gesture in the hallway at school, his attorney Peter Brill said.

MS-13 members, Trump said, are brutally violent. ""They don't like shooting people because it's too quick, it's too fast,"" he said. Instead, they ""knife them, cut them, let them die slowly because it's more painful. These guys are animals."" Suffolk County has become the epicenter of an international effort to battle escalating MS-13 violence after the gruesome discovery of four bodies in Central Islip on Long Island in April — the four young men are believed to have been victims of the deadly MS-13 street gang — as lawmakers, educators and a horrified public try to shine a light on MS-13 and seek answers on how to stem the tide of murder and crime.

But while civil rights activists say they understand the need to eradicate MS-13, their concern is for the young people who are swept up with gang members unfairly, simply because they may have been wearing the wrong T- shirt or used a hand gesture that was incorrectly surmised to mean the teen was an MS-13 gang member. As many as nine teens, ranging in age from 14 to 17, may have been unfairly targeted so far across Suffolk County, reports indicate. The end result said Irma Solis, director of the NYCLU's Suffolk County Chapter, is a blanket of terror enveloping immigrant communities across Long Island. ""Parents are very scared,"" she said. While Sister Margaret Smyth of the North Fork Apostolate in Riverhead said there have been no major U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, to her knowledge in Suffolk County, Solis said that doesn't mean ICE isn't sparking a backlash of fear.

""They are doing it in a very subtle and a very individual way,"" Solis said. ""ICE is coming to folks' homes, stopping them on their way to work. We have had young boys who have been suspended from schools and have had no criminal records or any contact with police — but somehow, that information reached ICE and ICE picked them up."" The NYCLU's concern is that students picked up by ICE have not been told they're on any kind of list and have thereby been unable to contest the situation or unfair MS-13 label, even if they personally are not gang members — those teens are being denied their due process rights, Solis said. ""We recognize that these communities have seen MS-13 violence and families have lost loved ones,"" Solis said. But having a teen picked up and unfairly detained, she said, has its own damaging impacts. ""We are also seeing families that are being separated. These kids are the collateral damage. Picked up and transferred many miles from their families and attorneys,"" Solis said. She added that ""given some of the allegations made by the schools,"" the teens were never told they were suspected of gang activity, and ""the evidence is not very strong. We speak to other students, and it seems like they were put on a list by speaking to someone who might be in a gang, or by wearing a shirt.""

Police ultimately declared the Friday night march an unlawful assembly, as marchers who chanted ""white lives matter,"" ""you will not replace us"" and ""blood and soil,"" swung their torches in skirmishes with counterprotesters, the Daily Progress reported.

The brief march in Charlottesville came to an end when the two groups met at a statue of Thomas Jefferson, where attendees reported being pepper sprayed, at least one person was arrested and several were treated for minor injuries.

University president Teresa A. Sullivan condemned the march and the ""intolerable"" violence that occurred.

""I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behavior displayed by torch-bearing protestors that marched on our Grounds this evening. I strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including University personnel who were attempting to maintain order,"" she said in a statement posted to the school's Facebook account. ""The violence displayed on Grounds is intolerable and is entirely inconsistent with the University's values.""

In a news release Saturday, the university said police did not use pepper spray and instead maintained the pepper spray Friday night came from protesters. The school added that one protester was arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer described the march as a ""cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism and intolerance.""

""Everyone has a right under the First Amendment to express their opinion peaceably, so here's mine: Not only as the Mayor of Charlottesville, but as a UVA faculty member and alumnus, I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus,"" he wrote in a Facebook post.

Protesters at the Friday night march echoed sentiments of those who previously rallied against the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville's Emancipation Park.

White nationalists, neo-Nazis, members of the ""alt-right,"" and other groups who believe white Americans are being persecuted will gather for the Unite the Right rally in the park, formerly known as Lee Park, on Saturday.

The rally will be met with about 1,000 first responders and the National Guard will be on standby, as between 2,000 and 6,000 demonstrators, including protesters and counter-protesters, are expected to attend.

City Manager Maurice Jones said the event will mark the largest deployment of Virginia State Police officers in three decades.

""These are trying and difficult times for our city and our nation,"" Jones said. ""We have deep political and ideological differences, and those differences will play out here in our community this weekend. It will be stressful and it will be tense, but I'm optimistic that cooler heads will prevail and we will ultimately be stronger as a community once this event is over.""

Then I was thwarted. By a little fox.

Like a lot of folks who move out of big cities to mini farms, I didn’t have a clue what I was getting into. When we bought our land and built a house 20 years ago, all I saw was 6 acres of rolling hills of grass. One of the neighbors even cut and round-baled it.

When we moved in, I got one of those cheap Home Depot John Deere riding mowers to cut around the house and hired a guy to cut the field.

But he retired after a year, and I had to take over. We bought a midsize Kubota tractor with a 5-foot-wide belly mower to take care of the lawn and field. It took over 4 hours to do the job and another 2 hours to push-mow and weed whack around the house.

That got old fast, so I bought a speedy Exmark zero-turn mower, like the ones you see on golf courses and used by road crews. That cut mowing time nearly in half.

All was good until last year’s constant rain — so far, a repeat this spring — that had me cutting twice a week, killing any free time.

My solution: I let two acres on the far side of the property just grow, let myself forget about cutting it.

All spring it grew and grew. I cut the rest of the field and was on my deck with my can of Flying Dog in less than 3 hours. Mission accomplished.

Then it all went to hell.

First, our three dogs got curious about what was in the field and spent hours looking for mice and other critters to chase, as well as getting covered in ticks that like to jump from tall grass onto anything that walks by.

Then came the young fox who also saw the field as prime hunting grounds.

At first, my wife Michele and I didn’t think much of it, having had foxes, skunks, deer, rabbits, and even horses coming through the yard over the years. But this fox seemed a bit too at home in the tall grass.

At a distance, foxes are cute. But they can also carry rabies and mange. Our dogs got mange from a fox years ago, so I wanted this one gone.

Initially, I yelled at it off the deck, and the fox skipped off. When that no longer worked, I fired off a bottle rocket, and he ran for his life.

Then last week, as I mowed, the fox popped his head above the uncut field grass. This time he didn’t run. I got within 15 yards, and he just looked at me, unafraid. Not good.

I did a quick internet search for the local rules on shooting foxes and determined it was legal. My wife wasn’t happy with my plan, but I got my .22 Remington Nylon 66 rifle and returned to the Exmark and headed out to the field, a “Green Acres” vigilante.

Of course, the fox was gone. But I kept the rifle for the rest of the cutting job. I’m sure my neighbors thought I was the crazy one.

For the next few days, the fox came back, though my wife convinced me to keep the gun in the safe. Now it took two or three or more bottle rockets to scare him off.

My summer of laziness outfoxed, the only solution was to cut the grass. I started up the antique 1950 Farmall Cub, lowered the sickle arm and hit the field.

Gone went the ticks. Gone went the fox. The beer is still on ice.

First, our three dogs got curious about what was in the field and spent hours looking for mice and other critters to chase, as well as getting covered in ticks that like to jump from tall grass onto anything that walks by.

Then came the young fox who also saw the field as prime hunting grounds.

At first, my wife Michele and I didn’t think much of it, having had foxes, skunks, deer, rabbits, and even horses coming through the yard over the years. But this fox seemed a bit too at home in the tall grass.

At a distance, foxes are cute. But they can also carry rabies and mange. Our dogs got mange from a fox years ago, so I wanted this one gone.

Initially, I yelled at it off the deck, and the fox skipped off. When that no longer worked, I fired off a bottle rocket, and he ran for his life.

Then last week, as I mowed, the fox popped his head above the uncut field grass. This time he didn’t run. I got within 15 yards, and he just looked at me, unafraid. Not good.

I did a quick internet search for the local rules on shooting foxes and determined it was legal. My wife wasn’t happy with my plan, but I got my .22 Remington Nylon 66 rifle and returned to the Exmark and headed out to the field, a “Green Acres” vigilante.

Of course, the fox was gone. But I kept the rifle for the rest of the cutting job. I’m sure my neighbors thought I was the crazy one.

For the next few days, the fox came back, though my wife convinced me to keep the gun in the safe. Now it took two or three or more bottle rockets to scare him off.

My summer of laziness outfoxed, the only solution was to cut the grass. I started up the antique 1950 Farmall Cub, lowered the sickle arm and hit the field.

Gone went the ticks. Gone went the fox. The beer is still on ice.

Paul Bedard is a senior columnist and author of Washington Secrets.",I had a great plan this summer to spend less time cutting acres of grass and more time on my deck sipping Flying Dog Brewery’s Dead Rise summer ale flavored with Old Bay seasoning.

Handwritten letters were also sent to three mosques and other places in London in July, all of which bore a Sheffield postmark, leading counter-terror units to believe the campaign is being orchestrated near the Yorkshire town.

Hate mail bearing the postmark was also sent to to at least four American mosques this year and three UK mosques in July 2016.

Many of the letters, which have been seen by the The Guardian, are signed by the same pseudonym or initials.

Three of the letters received by US mosques were sent at the same time, with the postmarks reading 5.14pm or 5.15pm on February 22.

Steve Rose, who oversees content at counter-extremist group Faith Matters, said there were other similarities.

'There were two second-class stamps on all the letters sent to the USA, which is interesting.

'There are similarities in the shape of the numbers. It could be one person sending them, it could be several people.'

Muslims in east London were targeted as Forest Gate mosque, Coventry Cross mosque in Bromley-by-Bow and Dalston's Shacklewell Lane mosque received letters last month threatening that the sender would visit each one.

In July 2016, three other London mosques in Leyton, Finsbury Park and Tottenham were sent white powder.

The packages were also sent to the Bank of England and the parliamentary office of independent peer Nazir Ahmed.

The letters also contained offensive remarks about Pakistani Muslims, with one sent to a New Jersey mosque threatening death for Muslims alongside an offensive cartoon.

Anti-Muslim abuse watchdog TellMama reports similar letters were sent to mosques in New York, Georgia, and Kentucky this year.

In February letters bearing the same pseudonym were received by mosques in Washington DC, New Jersey and Alabama.

The latest letter was sent to South Dakota's Islam Center in June but Mr Rose fears others might be escaping scrutiny.

'Maybe other mosques got them but didn’t report it.'

On February 28 the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia,received written threats of violence and offensive cartoons, posted with two first-class UK stamps.

Spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations Corey Saylor says the letters he's seen all seem to have come from south Yorkshire.

'All the letters I have seen have similar drawings, handwriting, and originated from Sheffield.

'Whoever is behind these letters feels empowered to make people on the opposite side of the Atlantic feel afraid to go to their places of worship.

'Such religious intimidation is wrong in any context and I hope British authorities act to expose and bring appropriate legal charges against the sender.'

North East Counter Terrorism Unit issued a statement to say it was investigating.

'Police received a number of reports of malicious communications and packages which have been received in recent days across London.

'Specialist officers have attended the addresses and the contents of the packages were examined. In all cases, the substances were found not to be noxious or harmful.'

The police are considering the possibility that these latest letters are linked to the earlier packages of powder and letters reported in London, South Yorkshire and the US.

Mr Rose said Muslims should report any threatening behaviour at mosques to police.

'It’s encouraging that within a day they’d gone to mosques and the counter-terrorism unit was involved.

'Police are taking their time with it … and it’s very hard to trace. But it’s good they are taking it seriously.

'We need the mosques to report, and check their mail regularly.

'They should make sure they have hate mail policy in place for hateful mail. If you’re worried, contact 101.”","Counter-terror police are investigating letters and packages sent to mosques in London, South Yorkshire and the USA as Muslims face death threats and offensive cartoons."

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Alt-right activists and counterprotesters are expected to flood downtown Charlottesville Saturday as the Virginia city braces for the “Unite the Right” rally.

By noon, thousands are expected to gather in Emancipation Park, where barricades have been placed in proximity to the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

The rally comes hours after a large group of torch-bearing white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus Friday night.

Outraged by the city’s plans to remove the trace of its Confederate past, alt-right activists and Ku Klux Klan members have come to the city in recent months.

The city has become ground zero for white nationalists, neo-Confederates and alt-right activists from across the country protesting the removal of Confederate monuments.

Police anticipate the rally will attract as many as 2,000 to 6,000 people and could be the “largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States,” as described by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Approximately 1,000 law enforcement officers and first responders, including the largest deployment by Virginia State Police in 30 years will also be on site, Charlottesville City Manager Maurice Jones said.

Charlottesville, home of Thomas Jefferson and UVA, is known as a quiet and progressive college town. It’s population of 47,000 had 80% of its voters choose Hillary Clinton during last year’s election.

In April, the city council voted to remove the Lee statue but is on hold pending litigation. Two city parks that were named after Confederate generals were renamed, including Emancipation Park, the site of Saturday’s rally.

Saturday’s planned rally has residents on edge and a group of more than 40 local business owners near the park has asked the city to protect them.

“I have a lot of fears. I think most of us are just anxious, we don’t want there to be violence,” business owner Michael Rodi said of the rally.

“We don’t want to see a blood bath, we don’t want to see looting, we don’t want to see mass arrests we don’t want to see the police having to turn on citizens,” he added.

Many businesses came together to discuss their rights and how to protect their staff in anticipation of Saturday’s event. Others expect to be understaffed, with some planning to hand out water and sandwiches to police officers.

“If diversity makes you uncomfortable, this is probably not where you want to be” reads a sign that hangs in the entrance of Rodi’s business.

Torch-bearing white nationalists confirmed the fears of residents and officials Friday night when hundreds descended upon the UVA campus.

Chanting “blood and soil” and “you will not replace us,” the group rallied around a statue of Thomas Jefferson before they clashed with counter-protesters, CNN affiliate WWBT reported. The group left the university’s grounds when police arrived and ruled it an unlawful assembly.

“In my 47 years of association with @UVA, this was the most nauseating thing I’ve ever seen. We need an exorcism on the Lawn,” Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics tweeted.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer released a statement referring to Friday’s rally as a “cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights.”

“Everyone has a right under the First Amendment to express their opinion peaceably, so here’s mine: not only as the Mayor of Charlottesville but as a UVA faculty member and alumnus, I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus,” he added.

Friday’s march took place shortly after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction allowing alt-right activists to hold Saturday’s rally.

Earlier this week, city officials had tried to “modify” the rally’s permit to move the demonstration more than a mile away to McIntire Park, citing safety concerns.

Jason Kessler, who organized the “Unite the Right” rally, filed a lawsuit Thursday claiming the city’s intentions will violate free speech rights.

“While the City is disappointed by tonight’s ruling we will abide by the judge’s decision,” the city said in a statement late Friday. “The goal in moving the Unite the Right Rally from Emancipation Park to a larger, more accommodating space like McIntire Park had nothing to do with the content of the demonstrators’ speech.","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Alt-right activists and counterprotesters are expected to flood downtown Charlottesville Saturday as the Virginia city braces for the “Unite the Right” rall…"

It’s been going on for a long, long time.” Comments from state and local officials addressed the racism more directly. Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer spoke out against the white supremacists who gathered in his city. “They do not agree with the rules of democracy and they are on the losing side of history,” he said during a press conference Saturday evening. McAuliffe spoke directly to white supremacists during the press conference, reminding them that “we are a nation of immigrants.” McAuliffe said he spoke to Trump on Saturday and told the president he’d be willing to work together, despite their differences, to help prevent this kind of violence in the future. “There has got to be a movement in this country to bring people together,” McAuliffe said. The rally Saturday was thinly disguised on Facebook as an event in support of the statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee downtown, which is slated for removal as the city works to respect diverse voices in its telling of American history. It’s part of a nationwide effort to remove Confederate monuments from public property.

“As a lifelong resident of Charlottesville and a mother of two, this is about making the world more equitable for my children,” Leslie Scott-Jones of Solidarity C’Ville wrote in a news release. “I am not naive about the urgent threat of August 12, nor do I believe the threat ends there...

Alt-right activists and white supremacists planned to protest the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the city's Emancipation Park.

Virginia State Police said Saturday night that three people had been arrested in connection to the rally. Troy Dunigan, 21, of Chattanooga, Tenn., was charged with disorderly conduct; Jacob L. Smith, 21, of Louisa, Va., was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery; and James M. O'Brien, 44, of Gainesville, Fla., was charged with carrying a concealed weapon, Virginia State Police said.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency in the city to aid in the local response. He blamed ""mostly out-of-state protesters"" for the violence and clashes.

""I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours,"" McAuliffe said in a statement. He said state troopers and the Virginia National Guard were providing support to local authorities.

The violence didn't die down even after police attempted to clear the area. A car struck several people, resulting in multiple injuries.

In a tweet, President Trump said Americans must ""condemn all that hate stands for,"" saying ""there is no place for violence in America.""

After a series of earlier confrontations in Emancipation Park, police declared the assembly unlawful and officers in riot gear began to clear the area shortly after noon. The crowd quickly dispersed and police cleared the area, which had earlier been the site of aggressive clashes.

Jason Kessler, the organizer behind the ""Unite the Right"" rally, told CBS News he plans to sue the city for violating a court order permitting the rally to be held in the park.

""Our First Amendment rights were violated today,"" Kessler said by phone. He said the city of Charlottesville and McAuliffe violated the court ruling because they ""didn't like the outcome.""

Some protesters who came for the ""Unite the Right"" rally were armed and dressed in military-like clothing, while others wore shirts with Nazi symbols and quotes from Adolf Hitler. Another read ""diversity is just a genocidal scam.""

The protest turned violent well ahead of the rally's official noon start time. At least two people were treated for serious but non-life-threatening emergencies from altercations by 10:30 a.m. Counter-protesters flooded the area to square off with the group of alt-right activists and white supremacists. Police deployed tear gas against the crowd shortly before 11:30 a.m.

Members of Congress largely condemned the rally, with House Speaker Paul Ryan denouncing the ""spectacle"" as ""repugnant,"" calling on Americans to unite against hate.

First lady Melania Trump tweeted that ""no good comes from violence.""

Saturday's confrontation came after a large group of torch-bearing white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia (UVA) campus Friday night, after a judge issued a ruling allowing Saturday's protest to move forward.

UVA cancelled all scheduled events planned for Saturday citing ""ongoing public safety concerns,"" but announced that the college's medical center would remain open.

""The University is monitoring the developments in Charlottesville and continues to coordinate with state and local law enforcement,"" the school said in a statement.

Since Thursday, organizers of the rally has been involved in a legal battle regarding the place of this protest.

Citing crowd safety concerns, the city of Charlottesville approved a protest permit earlier this week for the event to specifically be held in a different larger park instead of the smaller Emancipation Park where the Lee statue stands.

Late Friday night, a U.S. district court judge in Charlottesville agreed. In the ruling, Judge Glen E. Conrad said the city's ""11th-hour decision"" to revoke the permit was ""based on the content of [Kessler's] speech rather than other neutral factors.""

Kessler was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the Rutherford Institute.

Several alt-right members were invited to speak at the rally including white nationalist Richard Spencer. Many credit Spencer with popularizing the term ""alt-right"" as he garnered national media attention after being heard shouting ""Hail Trump!"" at a white nationalist convention in Washington, D.C., and later, being punched in the face on Inauguration Day while giving an interview.

""I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behavior displayed by torch-bearing protesters that marched on our Grounds this evening,"" she said. ""The violence displayed on Grounds is intolerable and is entirely inconsistent with the University's values.""

Alt-right activists and white supremacists planned to protest the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the city's Emancipation Park.

Virginia State Police said Saturday night that three people had been arrested in connection to the rally. Troy Dunigan, 21, of Chattanooga, Tenn., was charged with disorderly conduct; Jacob L. Smith, 21, of Louisa, Va., was charged with misdemeanor assault and battery; and James M. O'Brien, 44, of Gainesville, Fla., was charged with carrying a concealed weapon, Virginia State Police said.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency in the city to aid in the local response. He blamed ""mostly out-of-state protesters"" for the violence and clashes.

""I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours,"" McAuliffe said in a statement. He said state troopers and the Virginia National Guard were providing support to local authorities.

The violence didn't die down even after police attempted to clear the area. A car struck several people, resulting in multiple injuries.

In a tweet, President Trump said Americans must ""condemn all that hate stands for,"" saying ""there is no place for violence in America.""

After a series of earlier confrontations in Emancipation Park, police declared the assembly unlawful and officers in riot gear began to clear the area shortly after noon. The crowd quickly dispersed and police cleared the area, which had earlier been the site of aggressive clashes.

Jason Kessler, the organizer behind the ""Unite the Right"" rally, told CBS News he plans to sue the city for violating a court order permitting the rally to be held in the park.

""Our First Amendment rights were violated today,"" Kessler said by phone. He said the city of Charlottesville and McAuliffe violated the court ruling because they ""didn't like the outcome.""

Some protesters who came for the ""Unite the Right"" rally were armed and dressed in military-like clothing, while others wore shirts with Nazi symbols and quotes from Adolf Hitler. Another read ""diversity is just a genocidal scam.""

The protest turned violent well ahead of the rally's official noon start time. At least two people were treated for serious but non-life-threatening emergencies from altercations by 10:30 a.m. Counter-protesters flooded the area to square off with the group of alt-right activists and white supremacists. Police deployed tear gas against the crowd shortly before 11:30 a.m.

Rally supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other Saturday morning.



Men dressed in militia uniforms were carrying shields and openly carrying long guns. Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler planned what he called a ""pro-white"" rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.



City officials declared a local emergency shortly after 11 a.m.





Colleen Cook, 26, stood on a curb shouting at the rally attendees to go home.



Cook, a teacher who attended the University of Virginia, said she sent her black son out of town for the weekend.



""This isn't how he should have to grow up,"" she said.



Cliff Erickson leaned against a fence and took in the scene. He said he thinks removing the statue amounts to erasing history and said the ""counterprotesters are crazier than the alt-right.""



""Both sides are hoping for a confrontation,"" he said.



It's the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C., voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee from a downtown park.



 In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.



Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and ""advocating for white people.""



""This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,"" he said in an interview.



Between rally attendees and counter-protesters, authorities were expecting as many as 6,000 people, Charlottesville police said this week.



Among those expected to attend are Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and ""alt-right"" activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.



Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which track extremist groups, said the event has the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.



Officials have been preparing for the rally for months. Virginia State Police will be assisting local authorities, and a spokesman said the Virginia National Guard ""will closely monitor the situation and will be able to rapidly respond and provide additional assistance if needed.""



Police instituted road closures around downtown, and many businesses in the popular open-air shopping mall opted to close for the day.



Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on call.





There were also fights Friday night, when hundreds of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches.



A university spokesman said one person was arrested and several people were injured.



Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer said he was disappointed that the white nationalists had come to his town and blamed President Donald Trump for inflaming racial prejudices with his campaign last year.



""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.""





Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city that's home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.



The statue's removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville's history of race is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. They're now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.



For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials. A judge has agreed to a temporary injunction that blocks the city from removing the statue for six months.","Rally supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other Saturday morning."

In what has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades, thousands of white nationalists, alt-righters, and white supremacists have gathered in the Virginia college town. Charlottesville has become something of a ground-zero for white nationalism due to the city’s decision to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee. Besides protesting the removal of the statute, the rallygoers have claimed they are standing up for free speech and the rights of white people.

As marchers began gathering near Emancipation Park, many could be seen brandishing white supremacist and Nazi regalia. Others came armed with guns, shields and clubs:

Hundreds of counter-protesters also made their way to the rally, leading to the inevitable clashes that city leaders feared would occur. Even though the rally wasn’t scheduled to start until noon, police had to intervene when fights broke out in the streets between white nationalists and antifa and anti-racist gatherers.

According to CNN, multiple people have been injured in fights and there are concerns things will get far worse this afternoon. Police eventually issued a local emergency order at the scene of the demonstration. Mediaite’s Caleb Ecarma, who was on the scene, reported that police told everyone to leave or they will be arrested, as “the event has been declared an unlawful assembly.”

Following Ecarma’s dispatch, police in riot gear lined up and told the crowd it needed to clear the park immediately, essentially bringing the rally to a close before it officially began. Ecarma noted that he saw a number of people covered with blood on the streets.

The rally occurs a day after hundreds of white supremacists took part in a torch-lit march on the University of Virginia, chanting “white lives matter” and “blood and soil.” Violence also broke out at that march.

UPDATE 12:45 PM ET: The governor of Virginia has since called a state of emergency over the violence in the city and the National Guard has been called into action.

James Fields is accused of driving a car into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally Saturday in a Virginia college town, killing a 32-year-old woman.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia (WTVD) -- Officials have identified the suspect being held in a Virginia jail in connection with a deadly crash near a scheduled rally of white nationalists as James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio.

Fields is being held on suspicion of second-degree murder, malicious wounding, and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death.

He is accused of driving a car into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally Saturday in a Virginia college town, killing a 32-year-old woman, sending at least 26 others to hospitals and ratcheting up tension in an increasingly violent confrontation.

* Police identify suspect

* Trump comments: ""It has no place in America. What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order.""

* Trump hold news conference; signs VA Choice Quality Employment Act & commented on the protest

Gov. Roy Cooper commented about the incident saying, ""The tragedy in Charlottesville today has no place in our society. Valuing diversity makes us stronger.""

A helicopter crash that killed the pilot and a passenger later in the afternoon outside Charlottesville also was linked to the rally by State Police, though officials did not elaborate on how the crash was connected.

The chaos boiled over at what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade: the governor declared a state of emergency, police dressed in riot gear ordered people out and helicopters circled overhead. The group had gathered to protest plans to remove a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and others who arrived to protest the racism.

Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said several hundred counter-protesters were marching when ""suddenly there was just this tire screeching sound."" A silver Dodge Challenger smashed into another car, then backed up, barreling through ""a sea of people.""

The impact hurled people into the air. Those left standing scattered, screaming and running for safety in different directions.

The driver was later arrested, authorities said.

The turbulence began Friday night when the white nationalists carried torches through the university campus in what they billed as a ""pro-white"" demonstration. It quickly spiraled into violence Saturday morning. Hundreds of people threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. One person was arrested in connection.

President Donald Trump condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" what he called an ""egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"" after the clashes. He called for ""a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.""

Trump says he's spoken with the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, and ""we agreed that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now.""

But some of the white nationalists cited Trump's victory as validation for their beliefs, and Trump's critics pointed to the president's racially tinged rhetoric as exploiting the nation's festering racial tension.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson noted that Trump for years publicly questioned President Barack Obama's citizenship.

""We are in a very dangerous place right now,"" he said.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a ""pro-white"" rally in Charlottesville. White nationalists and their opponents promoted the event for weeks.

Oren Segal, who directs the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said multiple white power groups gathered in Charlottesville, including members of neo-Nazi organizations, racist skinhead groups and Ku Klux Klan factions.

The white nationalist organizations Vanguard America and Identity Evropa; the Southern nationalist League of the South; the National Socialist Movement; the Traditionalist Workers Party; and the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights also were on hand, he said, along with several groups with a smaller presence.

On the other side, anti-fascist demonstrators also gathered in Charlottesville, but they generally aren't organized like white nationalist factions, said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Many others were just locals caught in the fray.

Colleen Cook, 26, stood on a curb shouting at the rally attendees to go home.

Cook, a teacher who attended the University of Virginia, said she sent her son, who is black, out of town for the weekend.

White nationalists carry torches on the grounds of the University of Virginia, on the eve of a planned Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S. August 11, 2017. Picture taken August 11, 2017.

Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

The home of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, has become a particularly quiet and progressive college town in recent years. In fact, 80 percent of the voters in the small city voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. So why would the left-leaning town, where roughly 47,000 people currently live, be chosen for white nationalist rally headed by the alt-right?

Charlottesville city council in April voted to remove a statue of Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, one of the last standing Confederate monuments in the state. The statue stands in a park that was also recently renamed from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. Although the removal of the statue is still pending litigation, white nationalists are opposing the decision in an effort to cling on to their white history.

White rights activist Jason Kessler, a Charlottesville resident who organized Saturday's ""Unite the Right"" protest, blamed all ""the anti-white hatred that's coming out of the city"" as the reason for the rally, CNN reported.

""This entire community is a very far left community that has absorbed these cultural Marxist principles advocated in college towns across the country, about blaming white people for everything,"" Kessler told CNN on Friday.

However, the tearing down of the monument may not be the only reason why Charlottesville became a prime location for alt-right leaders to hold a rally. The small city's history is muddled in racism.

The town, considered a community of the Jim Crow South back in the early 1900s, was the last in America to desegregate schools following the Supreme Court's ruling on Brown v. Board of Education, which allowed black children to attend historically white-only schools. Despite ordering desegregation with ""all deliberate speed,"" in 1955, Virginia strongly resisted the ruling. Some schools even shut down in Charlottesville before finally allowing integration in 1958.

In 2015, Charlottesville was under fire for racist behavior following the violent arrest of Martese Johnson, a third-year student at the University. Johnson, a black man, was confronted by three white police officers who, after asking for identification, assumed he was holding a fake I.D.. and beat him before throwing him in cuffs. A video of the altercation went viral, sparking a nationally trending hashtag #JusticeForMartese on Twitter and bringing attention to the aggressive force law enforcement enacted on blacks in the community.

Virginia overall also has longstanding ties to the Ku Klux Klan. In a study released in 2015, researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University discovered there had been more than 2,000 KKK klaverns established in the U.S. between 1915 and 1940, 132 of which had been spread across the state of Virginia.

White nationalists carry torches on the grounds of the University of Virginia, on the eve of a planned Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S. August 11, 2017. Picture taken August 11, 2017.

Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

The home of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, has become a particularly quiet and progressive college town in recent years. In fact, 80 percent of the voters in the small city voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. So why would the left-leaning town, where roughly 47,000 people currently live, be chosen for white nationalist rally headed by the alt-right?

Charlottesville city council in April voted to remove a statue of Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, one of the last standing Confederate monuments in the state. The statue stands in a park that was also recently renamed from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. Although the removal of the statue is still pending litigation, white nationalists are opposing the decision in an effort to cling on to their white history.

White rights activist Jason Kessler, a Charlottesville resident who organized Saturday's ""Unite the Right"" protest, blamed all ""the anti-white hatred that's coming out of the city"" as the reason for the rally, CNN reported.

""This entire community is a very far left community that has absorbed these cultural Marxist principles advocated in college towns across the country, about blaming white people for everything,"" Kessler told CNN on Friday.

However, the tearing down of the monument may not be the only reason why Charlottesville became a prime location for alt-right leaders to hold a rally. The small city's history is muddled in racism.

The town, considered a community of the Jim Crow South back in the early 1900s, was the last in America to desegregate schools following the Supreme Court's ruling on Brown v. Board of Education, which allowed black children to attend historically white-only schools. Despite ordering desegregation with ""all deliberate speed,"" in 1955, Virginia strongly resisted the ruling. Some schools even shut down in Charlottesville before finally allowing integration in 1958.

In 2015, Charlottesville was under fire for racist behavior following the violent arrest of Martese Johnson, a third-year student at the University. Johnson, a black man, was confronted by three white police officers who, after asking for identification, assumed he was holding a fake I.D.. and beat him before throwing him in cuffs. A video of the altercation went viral, sparking a nationally trending hashtag #JusticeForMartese on Twitter and bringing attention to the aggressive force law enforcement enacted on blacks in the community.

Virginia overall also has longstanding ties to the Ku Klux Klan. In a study released in 2015, researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University discovered there had been more than 2,000 KKK klaverns established in the U.S. between 1915 and 1940, 132 of which had been spread across the state of Virginia.

Just in July, Klansmen held a rally of their own at Emancipation Park, similarly protesting the removal of the statue. About 30 Klansmen attended that particular rally and were met by nearly 1,000 counter protesters.

Rally supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other Saturday morning.



Men dressed in militia uniforms were carrying shields and openly carrying long guns. Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler planned what he called a ""pro-white"" rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.



City officials declared a local emergency shortly after 11 a.m.





Colleen Cook, 26, stood on a curb shouting at the rally attendees to go home.



Cook, a teacher who attended the University of Virginia, said she sent her black son out of town for the weekend.



""This isn't how he should have to grow up,"" she said.



Cliff Erickson leaned against a fence and took in the scene. He said he thinks removing the statue amounts to erasing history and said the ""counterprotesters are crazier than the alt-right.""



""Both sides are hoping for a confrontation,"" he said.



It's the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C., voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee from a downtown park.



 In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.



Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and ""advocating for white people.""



""This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,"" he said in an interview.



Between rally attendees and counter-protesters, authorities were expecting as many as 6,000 people, Charlottesville police said this week.



Among those expected to attend are Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and ""alt-right"" activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.



Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which track extremist groups, said the event has the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.



Officials have been preparing for the rally for months. Virginia State Police will be assisting local authorities, and a spokesman said the Virginia National Guard ""will closely monitor the situation and will be able to rapidly respond and provide additional assistance if needed.""



Police instituted road closures around downtown, and many businesses in the popular open-air shopping mall opted to close for the day.



Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on call.





There were also fights Friday night, when hundreds of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches.



A university spokesman said one person was arrested and several people were injured.



Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer said he was disappointed that the white nationalists had come to his town and blamed President Donald Trump for inflaming racial prejudices with his campaign last year.



""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.""





Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city that's home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.



The statue's removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville's history of race is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. They're now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.



For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials. A judge has agreed to a temporary injunction that blocks the city from removing the statue for six months.","Rally supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other Saturday morning."

Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park.

U.S. District Judge Glen Conrad issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed by the city against right-wing blogger Jason Kessler, who organized a rally on Saturday to protest the city’s vote to remove Lee’s statue. Earlier in the week, the city announced that the rally had to be moved out of Emancipation Park to a larger venue, citing safety reasons. Kessler sued in response and the judge granted the injunction to let the rally continue in the park.

“It’s important we preserve this history that is under attack,” Kessler said.

After the ruling late Friday night, white nationalists and so-called “Unite the right” protesters descended on the University of Virginia campus with tiki torches, which they threw at counter-protesters. The tense atmosphere was further inflamed Saturday morning as white nationalists took to Emancipation Park, with people shouting obscene words at counter protesters. ThinkProgress reporters Joshua Eaton and Alan Pyke, who were on the scene at Emancipation Park, also observed scuffles between protesters on both sides.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer wrote in a Facebook post Friday night, “I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.”

“As President of the University of Virginia, I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behavior displayed by torch-bearing protestors that marched on our Grounds this evening,” University President Teresa Sullivan said in a statement. “I strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including University personnel who were attempting to maintain order.

President Donald Trump, who often likes to weigh in on national incidents, has yet to weigh in on the violent protests. But his adviser Sebastian Gorka has said that people should stop criticizing white supremacists.

According to the Washington Post, the march, which lasted only 15 to 20 minutes, was made up mostly of white men in their 20s and 30s, though some appeared to be teenagers, and footage from the rally shows women were present, too. Nazi salutes were prevalent.

The march ended in a rally around the campus’ statue of Thomas Jefferson, UVA’s founder, and dispersed after a counter protester used a chemical spray on a dozen or so marchers. There were no immediate reports of arrests stemming from the rally or small counter protest.

The evening’s march came on the eve of a white supremacist and alt-right-led rally, Unite the Right, which began early Saturday morning. Notable alt-right figures expected to attend the Charlottesville, Virginia, rally include Richard Spencer, Mike Enoch, and Pax Dickinson.

According to the rally’s organizer, a white supremacist named Jason Kessler, white supremacists, nationalists, and members of the alt-right are congregating at Emancipation Park, formerly Lee Park, to support the site of a statue of Robert E. Lee. The city voted to remove the statue earlier this year, but the decision is still pending a judge’s ruling expected later in August.

An estimated 1,000 protesters are expected to take part in Saturday’s rally, while larger numbers of counter protesters are anticipated.

In a statement addressing the rally, Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer called the UVA march a “cowardly parade” of hatred and racism, and he said he was “disgusted” by the display of intimidation.

Update 12:55pm, Aug. 12: According to the New York Times, UVA officials said in a statement that one person was arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct. Several others were injured, including a university police officer injured while making the arrest.","The protesters chanted 'One people, one nation, end immigration.'"

University of Virginia Medical Centre spokeswoman Angela Taylor confirmed the death, while the mayor of Charlottesville Michael Signer said via Twitter that he is “heartbroken” to announce that a “life has been lost”.

Witnesses said a car ploughed into a crowd of people who were protesting against a rally held by white nationalists who oppose the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee by civic officials in Charlottesville.

The city had been the scene of violent clashes between the nationalists and counter-protesters earlier.

Speaking in New Jersey, US president Donald Trump condemned “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” in Virginia.

He added: “What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.”

And the US leader added that Americans must come together “with love for our nation … and true affection for each other”.

A state official later said the male driver of a car is in police custody.

During the incident an Associated Press reporter saw at least one person on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately after the car careened into a group of people several hundred strong.

Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said counter-protesters were marching when “suddenly there was just this tyre screeching sound”.

A silver vehicle smashed into another car, then reversed, ploughing through “a sea of people”.

The incident happened about two hours after violent clashes broke out between white nationalists and others who arrived to protest against them.

At least eight were injured and one arrested in connection with earlier violence when marchers and counter-protesters traded punches and threw missiles at each other.

Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, and riot police ordered people to disperse.

Small bands of protesters who showed up to express their opposition to the rally were seen marching around the city peacefully by mid-afternoon, chanting and waving flags, while helicopters circled overhead.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a “pro-white” rally to protest the city of Charlottesville’s decision to remove the confederate statue from a city centre park.

— -- The usually quiet university city of Charlottesville, Virginia, erupted into chaos Saturday when far-right extremists gathering for a ""Unite the Right"" event clashed with counterprotesters, leaving more than a dozen injured and several under arrest.

The day turned deadly when a car plowed into a group of counterprotesters, killing a 32-year-old woman and leaving 19 others injured, five critically. The driver was charged with murder in the afternoon incident that a bystander described as ""the most horrible thing I've ever witnessed.""

And two state troopers who were part of the response to the events in Charlottesville died when their helicopter crashed several miles outside the city.

The gathering in the morning of white nationalists was roundly condemned and a number of politicians called for the car-ramming of the crowd to be called a terror attack. But President Trump drew scrutiny for issuing what some viewed as an equivocating statement that there was ""hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.""

In the wake of early, violent clashes between white nationalist rallygoers and counterprotesters, Virginia state authorities around midday declared the gathering unlawful and ordered both sides to ""disperse immediately.""

The Virginia State Police posted videos on Facebook of officers breaking up the ""Unite the Right"" gathering and counterprotest. Warning: The videos contain some offensive language and images.

One video shows an officer in announcing to milling crowds: ""This gathering has been declared as to be an unlawful assembly; in the name of the Commonwealth, you are commanded to immediately disperse; if you do not disperse immediately you will be arrested.” Another video shows some of the crowd.

Charlottesville police reported Saturday evening that 14 people had been injured in the clashes and that more than a dozen others were injure in the vehicle ramming incident that left a woman dead in the city's downtown. Police charged James Alex Fields, 20, of Ohio Saturday night with second degree murder related to the death.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe referenced two additional fatalities during a Saturday press conference, but did not elaborate on the nature of the deaths. President Donald Trump tweeted condolences ""to the families & fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today"" shortly after.

Saturday evening, the state police announced three additional arrests in relation to the planned rally, issuing charges of disorderly conduct, misdemeanor assault and battery, and carrying a concealed handgun to three individuals, respectively.

The individuals were Troy Dunigan, 21, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, arrested and charged with disorderly conduct; Jacob L. Smith, 21, of Louisa, Virginia, arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault and battery; James M. O’Brien, 44, of Gainesville, Florida, arrested and charged with carrying a concealed handgun.

The attempted rally and clashes came after a Friday night march by torch-bearing white nationalists on and near the University of Virginia campus, which resulted in brawls with protesters countering the event.

The Unite the Right event Saturday was supposed to begin at noon, but people both in support and opposed to the rally began gathering earlier and by 11 a.m. two people had been treated for serious but non-life-threatening injuries after an altercation at the city's Emancipation Park, according to city officials.

McAuliffe placed the National Guard on standby in preparation for the rally, an action he took even before the clashes Friday night.

""I have been in contact with our Department of Justice agents assisting at the scene and state officials,"" Sessions said. ""We will continue to support our state and local officers on the ground in any way possible. We stand united behind the President in condemning the violence in Charlottesville and any message of hate and intolerance. This kind of violence is totally contrary to American values and can never be tolerated. I want to thank all law enforcement personnel in the area for their commitment to protecting this community and the rule of law.""

Charlottesville has become a flash point for white nationalists and protesters seeking to counter them since a city council vote in February to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park formerly called Lee Park but renamed in June as Emancipation Park.

A group opposed to the council's decision sued, and in May a judge issued a six-month injunction against the city's removing the statue while litigation proceeds.

On Friday night, hundreds of white nationalists carrying torches and chanting ""white lives matter,"" ""you will not replace us,"" and the Nazi-associated phrase ""blood and soil"" marched near a statue of Thomas Jefferson on the grounds of the University of Virginia, and were met by counterprotesters.

Police arrived on campus, declared it an unlawful assembly, and ordered the crowds to disperse. University police arrested one person who was charged with assault and disorderly conduct, a university statement Saturday said. ""Several other members of the university community sustained minor injuries during the confrontation.""

McAuliffe was direct Saturday night in his condemnation of those who arrived to attend the rally Saturday, telling the group to ""go home.""

""You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. Shame on you,"" he said. ""You pretend that you're patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.""

University President Teresa A. Sullivan, ""strongly condemned the demonstration,"" the statement said, adding that the ""intimidating and abhorrent behavior displayed by the alt-right protesters was wrong.""

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer called the event ""a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance,"" adding that he was ""beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.""

A mass prayer service was held at St. Paul’s Memorial Church on University Avenue that was organized in response to the rally, according to The Daily Progress, a local paper.

Cornel West, a prominent leftist philosopher and political activist, spoke at the prayer service, calling the ""Unite the Right"" rally the “biggest gathering of a hate-driven right wing in the history of this country in the last 30 to 35 years,” the Daily Progress reported.

At least eight were injured and one arrested in connection with earlier violence when marchers and counter-protesters traded punches and threw missiles at each other.

Small bands of protesters who showed up to express their opposition to the rally were seen marching around the city peacefully by mid-afternoon, chanting and waving flags, while helicopters circled overhead.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a “pro-white” rally to protest the city of Charlottesville’s decision to remove the confederate statue from a city centre park.

It is the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, DC, voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a night-time protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group travelled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

Mr Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols, but also about free speech and “advocating for white people”.

“This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,” he said in an interview.

Among those expected to attend the rally were Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and “alt-right” activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.

Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which track extremist groups, said the event had the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.

There were also fights on Friday night, when hundreds of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches.

A university spokesman said one person was arrested and several people were injured.

Mr Signer said he was disgusted that the white nationalists had come to his town, and blamed President Donald Trump for inflaming racial prejudices with his campaign last year.

He said: “I’m not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you’re seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.”

Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city which is home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.

The statue’s removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville’s history is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. They’re now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.

For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund has filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials.

A judge has agreed to a temporary injunction which blocks the city from removing the statue for six months.",A further 19 have been injured during protests to remove a Confederate monument from a Charlottesville park.

Witnesses said a car ploughed into a crowd of people who were protesting against a rally held by white nationalists who oppose the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee by civic officials in Charlottesville.

The city had been the scene of violent clashes between the nationalists and counter-protesters earlier.

Speaking in New Jersey, US president Donald Trump condemned “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” in Virginia.

He added: “What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.”

And the US leader added that Americans must come together “with love for our nation … and true affection for each other”.

A state official later said the male driver of a car is in police custody.

During the incident an Associated Press reporter saw at least one person on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately after the car careened into a group of people several hundred strong.

Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said counter-protesters were marching when “suddenly there was just this tyre screeching sound”.

A silver vehicle smashed into another car, then reversed, ploughing through “a sea of people”.

Lee statue violently clashed with counter-protesters.

One woman died and 19 others were being treated for injuries after a car plowed into a crowd of demonstrators, authorities said. Two Virginia state troopers also died when a helicopter crashed nearby.

“We are closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia,” Trump told reporters at his golf club in New Jersey.

“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides – on many sides,” he said.

On Saturday evening, a White House aide issued a statement clarifying why the president used the phrase ""on many sides” instead of singling out the white nationalists who initially gathered in Charlottesville.

“The president was condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides,” a White House official said. “There was violence between protesters and counter protesters today.”

During his remarks, the president said he spoke with Virginia Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who declared a state of emergency on Saturday.

“What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives,” the president said. “No citizen should ever fear for safety and security in our society. And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time.”

The president made the comments during a bill signing with Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. He also expressed his sympathy to those who died in the helicopter crash.

“Deepest condolences to the families & fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today,” Trump tweeted. “You're all among the best this nation produces.”

Earlier Saturday, Trump first responded to the unrest on Twitter.

“We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for,” the president tweeted. “There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!”



Vice President Mike Pence also weighed in, tweeting: “I stand with @POTUS against hate & violence. U.S is greatest when we join together & oppose those seeking to divide us. #Charlottesville.”

The demonstrators gathered for a ""pro-white"" rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park.

VIOLENT CLASHES ERUPT AT ‘UNITE THE RIGHT’ RALLY IN VIRGINIA

Thousands of supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other Saturday.

Both Republicans and Democrats released statements Saturday criticizing the protesters.

“The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant,” House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted. “Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.”

Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for governor in Virginia, said: “Having a right to spew vile hate does not make it right. It is painful to see these ugly events in Charlottesville last night and today.”

Former President Bill Clinton tweeted: “Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy. #Charlottesville”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2016, said the white nationalist demonstration “is a reprehensible display of racism and hatred.”

“While this incident is alarming, it is not surprising,” Sanders said in a statement. “Hate crimes and shows of hostility toward minorities have recently been surging.”

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said the “march and rally in Charlottesville goes against everything the American flag stands for.”

Ronna McDaniel, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Saturday the “hate & bigotry on display in #charlottesville is dangerous & cowardly.”

“Free speech may give them the right to do this but also empowers us to unite to loudly speak out against it,” McDaniel tweeted.

Likewise, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez spoke out against the gathering.

“The vile & bigoted display of hate in #Charlottesville has no place in America,” Perez said. “We stand against white supremacy wherever it appears.”

First Lady Melania Trump also called for ending the violence.

“Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville,” Melania Trump tweeted.

Clashes first broke out Friday night after a judge cleared the way for the protest to continue as planned. The unrest prompted McAuliffe to place National Guard members on standby and encourage Virginians to stay away from the event.

The mayor of Charlottesville said on Twitter on Saturday that he is ‘heartbroken’ to announce that a ‘life has been lost.’ He did not provide details.

Shocking footage shows fighting between dozens of protesters, paint being thrown on them and some of the protesters being pepper-sprayed in the face.

Police could be heard shouting: ‘We’ll not intervene until given command to do so.’

Members of the clergy at the local church could be seen linking arms in a bid to block one of the entrances to the park, while alt-right protesters chanted ‘White lives matter’ as they marched through.

The mayor has condemned the march as a ‘parade of hatred’.

Pictures from the protests last night showed white supremacists holding torches in the air and chanting slogans such as ‘one people, one nation, end immigration’ as they clashed with anti-fascism protesters.

“We are determined to take our country back,” Duke said. “We’re gonna fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in. That’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back.”

Duke — a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives who is attending the rally — was a vocal supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign and congratulated him upon his inauguration in January, tweeting, “We did it!”

Trump came under fire for initially declining to denounce Duke, whom he claimed to “know nothing about.”

“I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,” Trump told CNN during the campaign. “So I don’t know. I don’t know — did he endorse me, or what’s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.”

Police have declared a state of emergency in Charlottesville — home of University of Virginia — as violent confrontations break out between white nationalists and counter-protesters, including an incident overnight in which a crowd of white nationalists carrying torches encircled a group of counter-protesters.

After being criticized for failing to comment on the rally, which was held in response to plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Trump finally issued a statement on Twitter Saturday afternoon, urging Americans to “come together as one!”

Other top Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), also condemned the white nationalists.

Asked by a reporter what the alt-right rally means to him, Duke said that it represents a “turning point for the people in this country.”

“We are determined to take our country back,” Duke said. “We’re gonna fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in. That’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back.”

Duke — a former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives who is attending the rally — was a vocal supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign and congratulated him upon his inauguration in January, tweeting, “We did it!”

Trump came under fire for initially declining to denounce Duke, whom he claimed to “know nothing about.”

“I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists,” Trump told CNN during the campaign. “So I don’t know. I don’t know — did he endorse me, or what’s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.”

Police have declared a state of emergency in Charlottesville — home of University of Virginia — as violent confrontations break out between white nationalists and counter-protesters, including an incident overnight in which a crowd of white nationalists carrying torches encircled a group of counter-protesters.

After being criticized for failing to comment on the rally, which was held in response to plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Trump finally issued a statement on Twitter Saturday afternoon, urging Americans to “come together as one!”

Other top Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), also condemned the white nationalists.

First lady Melania Trump also commented on the rally before her husband, tweeting that “no good comes from violence.”

Witnesses said a car ploughed into a crowd of people who were protesting against a rally held by white nationalists who oppose the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee by civic officials in Charlottesville.

The city had been the scene of violent clashes between the nationalists and counter-protesters earlier.

Speaking in New Jersey, US president Donald Trump condemned “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” in Virginia.

He added: “What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.”

And the US leader added that Americans must come together “with love for our nation … and true affection for each other”.

A state official later said the male driver of a car is in police custody.

During the incident an Associated Press reporter saw at least one person on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately after the car careened into a group of people several hundred strong.

Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said counter-protesters were marching when “suddenly there was just this tyre screeching sound”.

A silver vehicle smashed into another car, then reversed, ploughing through “a sea of people”.

The incident happened about two hours after violent clashes broke out between white nationalists and others who arrived to protest against them.

At least eight were injured and one arrested in connection with earlier violence when marchers and counter-protesters traded punches and threw missiles at each other.

Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, and riot police ordered people to disperse.

Small bands of protesters who showed up to express their opposition to the rally were seen marching around the city peacefully by mid-afternoon, chanting and waving flags, while helicopters circled overhead.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a “pro-white” rally to protest the city of Charlottesville’s decision to remove the confederate statue from a city centre park.

It is the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, DC, voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a night-time protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group travelled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

Mr Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols, but also about free speech and “advocating for white people”.

“This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,” he said in an interview.

Among those expected to attend the rally were Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and “alt-right” activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.

Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which track extremist groups, said the event had the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.

There were also fights on Friday night, when hundreds of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches.

A university spokesman said one person was arrested and several people were injured.

Mr Signer said he was disgusted that the white nationalists had come to his town, and blamed President Donald Trump for inflaming racial prejudices with his campaign last year.

He said: “I’m not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you’re seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.”

Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city which is home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.

The statue’s removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville’s history is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. They’re now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.

For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund has filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials.

A judge has agreed to a temporary injunction which blocks the city from removing the statue for six months.",A further 19 have been injured during protests to remove a Confederate monument from a Charlottesville park.

At least one person was killed on Saturday and 35 injured as protests turned violent in Charlottesville, Virginia, as white supremacists clashed with counterdemonstrators and a car rammed into a crowd of anti-racist and anti-fascist demonstrators.

A 32-year-old female was among those killed in the car-ramming, said Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas, and injuries ranged from life-threatening to minor.

She was later named on social media as Heather Heyer and a fundraising page for her family has raised nearly $20,000, at the time of publication.

A 20-year-old man was held by police on charges relating to the car incident, including second-degree murder, according to police. The FBI opened a civil rights probe.

The Charlottesville Police Department said in a statement on Saturday night that James Alex Fields Jr of Ohio also faces three counts of malicious wounding and one count related to leaving the scene.

The Charlottesville City Council voted unanimously on Saturday to allow the police chief to declare a curfew. No action on the move has been taken yet, Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer said on his Facebook page.

Earlier on Saturday, Signer confirmed on Twitter that at least one person had died in the car-ramming incident.

The hospital in Charlottesville reported that at least 19 people were injured.

Pepper spray, batons and makeshift weapons were used as far-right demonstrators clashed with counterprotesters throughout Saturday.

Organised by Jason Kessler, a former journalist and a member of the Proud Boys, an ultra-nationalist group, the “Unite the Right” rally was planned to voice opposition to the removal of a Confederate statue and has been described as one of the largest white supremacist events in recent US history.

Writing on Twitter on Saturday morning, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe announced a state of emergency to “aid response to violence at the alt-right rally in Charlottesville”.

It is the third event of its type to be held in Charlottesville, a university town of 46,000 people, throughout the last four months.

Earlier this year, the city voted to remove a statue of Robert E Lee, the foremost Confederate military leader during the US Civil War, prompting similar far-right protests in May and July.

Among those in attendance are well-known figures such as Mike Peinovich, a white supremacist podcaster who also goes by Mike Enoch, and Richard Spencer, a leading figure in the alt-right, a loosely knit group that includes white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

The groups who sent members included the National Socialist Movement, the Traditionalist Worker Party, the neo-Confederate League of the South and Identity Evropa, among other white supremacist and far-right movements.

Emily Gorcenski, a Charlottesville-based activist, said that far-rightist activists made “threats, many promises of violence and incitement to violence” before Unite the Right.

“What we’re seeing is that they have no qualms about allying themselves with violent and hateful groups like the National Socialist Movement, the KKK and other [similar] organisations,” she told Al Jazeera.

Led by local church groups, community organisers and Black Lives Matter, several counterdemonstrations have started in different locations across the city.

Although city officials attempted to move Unite the Right from Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue, to another nearby park, a federal judge reinstated the group’s permit for the original venue on Friday.

The Virginia state police announced on Twitter that arrests had been made, but it did not specify how many people had been detained.

A police helicopter crashed and killed the pilot and a passenger later in the afternoon outside Charlottesville while en route to the rally, though officials did not elaborate the details.

On Friday night, hundreds of marchers descended on the University of Virginia carrying torches and yelling slogans “white lives matter” and “blood and soil”.

Others reportedly chanted: “You will not replace us.”

According to anti-racist and anti-fascist activists who were present, the far-right activists encircled and attacked a group of students who were holding a counterprotest.

Michael Payne, cochair of the local Democratic Socialists of America chapter, described Unite the Right as an “effort to intimidate the community”.

“Last night, the alt-right protesters initiated the violence … The neo-Nazis surrounded them with lit torches and started macing and beating the students,” he told Al Jazeera, explaining that police arrived after clashes started.

Videos and photos posted on social media also showed the far-rightists surrounding and confronting counterdemonstrators.

Police eventually intervened after clashes broke out and dispersed the crowd.

Payne said that local community organisations, church groups and the Black Lives Matter movement “have led the charge” in staging counterdemonstrations throughout the city.

After Friday night’s march, Kessler took to Twitter to celebrate the large turnout, describing it as a “incredible moment for white people”.

On Saturday, US President Donald Trump condemned the clashes in Charlottesville in a Twitter post. “There is no place for this kind of violence in America,” he wrote.

Far-right groups supported Trump’s campaign and celebrated his electoral victory last November, seeing common cause in his efforts to limit immigration and repeal affirmative action, among other policies.

Alexander Reid Ross, author of Against the Fascist Creep, explains that the Unite the Right rally was part of an effort to “shape the [far-right] movement as more serviceable populism”.

“What we’re seeing is Richard Spencer really attempting to get away from the sort of bickering that the alt-right has been involved in,” he told Al Jazeera, referring to recent disputes between various factions of the far right and militia groups.

Although the Oath Keepers and similar militia groups, most of which are pro-Trump, have publicly criticised the alt-right and groups like Identity Evropa for racism, they have shown up to several far-right protests to confront counterdemonstrators in recent months.

“They still say that there is a division that separates them, and that they’re against fascism and racism, but it’s clear that fascists are using these rallies to organise,” Ross said.

Spencer and other Unite the Right participants lauded the large turnout for Unite the Right and Friday’s march at the University of Virginia.

In a YouTube video, Spencer said: “There’s nothing more beautiful than a torch-light march.”

He added: “This movement is growing, and we’re occupying space and doing it symbolically.”

Unite the Right comes after months of increased clashes between far-right groups and anti-fascists.

Kim Kelly, a journalist and member of the Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council, travelled to Charlottesville to attend Saturday’s counterdemonstrations.

“We’re at a pivotal point in American history, and in 10 or 20 years’ time, when our grandchildren ask us where we were when fascism came to America, some will say that they stayed home and waited for the next election,” she told Al Jazeera.

“But many of us will be able to say that we were down there on the barricades, fighting back. I know where I’ll be. Do you?”",Charlottesville mayor says at least one dead and dozens injured in car ramming that hit counter-protesters.

She had been widowed at a young age and raised six children. But that was just the beginning.

My mother, Beall L. Comstock, died this afternoon at Medstar Georgetown Hospital of complications from pneumonia and other ailments. She was 96. She died in peace and without pain. Her defining quality was her Catholic faith. It was something she lived, and acted on, rather than talking about. It wasn’t the phony faith of the politician-stuffed, self-congratulatory prayer breakfast or the preacher claiming divine authorization for killing some head of state. It was Matthew 25. Read that passage and you will know why she worked for more than 20 years at the Zacchaeus soup kitchen in D.C. alongside other volunteers from her church, Blessed Sacrament near Chevy Chase Circle. She did hours of food prep work at home, collected donated food from supermarkets and then did hard, heavy work at the soup kitchen. She bonded with many of the homeless. If you want to know her essence, consider this story, which my youngest sister, her primary caregiver for many years now, reminded me of this week: One day, when she was nearing 90, she fell at her condo and suffered a spine fracture. It was a Monday. She went downtown, worked her full shift at the soup kitchen, and then went to the hospital. She lived an incredible life. I am glad she is no longer suffering, but when it comes to losing your mom, it makes no difference: it hurts as much at 62 as it would at 6. Godspeed, Mom. You will be wearing wings the size of a 747.

My first thought in reading that was: what a beautiful tribute.

But my second thought was: What a witness and what a life. Beall Comstock did what Peter did in this Gospel. She answered Christ’s call.

And: she walked on water.

This Gospel tells us that being able to do that is more than an act of faith. Much more.

It is also an act of obedience. It is being able to answer Christ, his call to “come,” his invitation to get out of the boat, to leave what is safe, and do what seems impossible.

It is an act of trust. It is an act of courage.

And it was losing courage that ultimately caused Peter to sink.

“When he saw how strong the wind was, he became frightened.” And then, he began to sink.

This Gospel offers us, in some ways, the same message we heard last week, and Jesus even used the same words to his apostles:

I know: it’s easier said than done. But Christ’s call to Peter is his call to us—just as it was his call to Beall Comstock and to countless other people of faith across history.

“Come. Do not be afraid. Do what seems impossible. Stand up to the wind. Go against the tide. Follow me. Give when you think you can’t. Love when you would rather not. Rise when you would rather stay down. Have faith. Come. And do not be afraid.”

How often do we feel the winds are against us?

How often do we feel that answering the call of Christ, his invitation to “Come,” is just too hard?

How often would we rather cling to what is safe and sure and just stay in the boat?

This Gospel turns all those doubts on their head.

Make no mistake: following Christ, answering his call, entails risk. Being faithful can be fraught with danger. Standing up to the winds of our age, or going against the tide, can be frightening.

Look at what we are up against. Read the headlines. Right now, we are facing the winds of war. In Virginia, we are encountering winds of racism and hate. Half a world away, our brothers and sisters are buffeted by winds of poverty and persecution and even martyrdom.

But Christ calls out in the middle of it all. He calls to us to be people of peace, to be people of life and justice, to be people of compassion and fidelity and love.

He calls us to be people of courage.

In spite of everything: “Do not be afraid.”

There’s an important detail at the end of of this Gospel that can be easy to overlook. Jesus didn’t leave his apostles alone and continue his walk across the water by himself.

No. He saved Peter from sinking—and then got into the boat with him. Together, they continued the journey.

When it comes to weathering the wind and the waves of life, we are all in the same boat—but we are not alone.

Christ is with us.

In part of his tribute, Beall Comstock’s son wrote about traveling with her to Ireland and visiting Galway, where his grandmother had been born.

She no doubt knew well the famous “Breastplate of St. Patrick”—an ancient prayer that has inspired generations of Irish Catholics and still speaks to us today, especially in light of this Sunday’s Gospel:

As we prepare to receive Christ in the Eucharist, and carry him within us into the world, let’s also carry the lesson of this Gospel in our hearts.

Whatever may come, stand up to the wind. Do not be afraid.

Because in the end, we are all in the same boat.

But we are not alone.","A few days ago, a friend of mine posted something beautiful on Facebook—a remembrance from a colleague of hers, Vince Rinehart, writing about his mother, who had just died.

In a statement, the team also threatened to take legal action:

According to CNN.com, right-wing groups and counter-protesters got into physical and verbal altercations ahead of the ""Unite the Right"" rally being held in Virginia on Saturday.

Ryan M. Kelly of the Daily Progress tweeted the following photo of a demonstrator carrying a sign adorned with the Red Wings' logo:

The protests began Friday night when nationalists converged on the University of Virginia's campus and marched while carrying torches.

Per CNN.com, the demonstration is in protest of Charlottesville's plans to remove traces of its Confederate past.","The Detroit Red Wings have condemned the use of their logo during white nationalist marches in Charlottesville, Virginia."

The arrest happened began shortly after police made a declaration of unlawful assembly at Emancipation Park, just before 11:30 a.m.

Charlottesville officials said 15 injuries were reported related to rally downtown.

Charlottesville Communications Director Miriam I. Dickler said the Virginia National Guard was called in to assist law enforcement in restoring order.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has declared a state of emergency “to aid state response to violence” ahead of Saturday’s “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, according to a post on his Twitter account.

“Law enforcement will continue to monitor the situation and respond as appropriate,” Dickler said.

Additionally, the University of Virginia cancelled all events that were scheduled for Saturday afternoon.

Fistfights and screaming matches erupted shortly before rally’s scheduled noon start. The skirmishes unfolded following a scuffle Friday night between torch-bearing demonstrators and counter-protesters at the nearby University of Virginia.

Saturday’s rally was the latest event drawing white nationalists and right-wing activists from across the country to this Democratic-voting college town — a development precipitated by the city’s decision to remove symbols of its Confederate past.

Here are the latest developments:
• Police began to break up crowds shortly before noon after city officials declared the gathering an “unlawful assembly.” Police officers spoke on bullhorns, directing people to leave.
• The declaration was made after fistfights and screaming matches erupted in several locations late Saturday morning.
• Some protesters fired pepper spray at other demonstrators, state police said.
• An unspecified number of protesters have been arrested in Charlottesville, state police said.

Police in riot gear stood shoulder to shoulder behind shields early Saturday afternoon, at times advancing toward crowds, CNN video shows. Members of the Virginia National Guard also were there.

It wasn’t immediately clear what led to the fights, though tensions and rhetoric were running hot. At one point, a few dozen white men wearing helmets and holding makeshift shields chanted, “Blood and soil!” Later, another group chanted slogans like, “Nazi scum off our streets!”

People punched and kicked each other during various scuffles, which often were broken up from within crowds, without police intervention, CNN video shows.

Earlier, a group of clergy and other counter-demonstrators, including activist and Harvard professor Cornel West, held hands, prayed and sang, “This Little Light of Mine.”

Police presence was heavy, with more than 1,000 officers expected to be deployed, city officials said. Police anticipated the rally would attract as many as 2,000 to 6,000 people, and the Southern Poverty Law Center said it could be the “largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States.”

Charlottesville, once home to Thomas Jefferson, is known as a progressive city of about 47,000 people. Eighty percent of its voters choose Hillary Clinton during last year’s election.

But far-right activists and Ku Klux Klan members have come here in recent months, outraged by the city’s intention to remove traces of its links to the Confederacy — including plans to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

The move follows efforts by communities across the South to remove Confederate iconography from public property since the 2015 rampage killings of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a self-described white supremacist.

Ahead of Saturday’s planned rally, tensions roiled Friday night as white nationalists — some holding what appeared to be backyard tiki-style torches — marched onto the University of Virginia’s campus.

Chanting, “Blood and soil” and “You will not replace us,” the group rallied around a statue of Thomas Jefferson before they clashed with counter-protesters, CNN affiliate WWBT reported. The group left the university’s grounds when police arrived and declared the gathering an unlawful assembly.

“In my 47 years of association with @UVA, this was the most nauseating thing I’ve ever seen. We need an exorcism on the Lawn,” Larry Sabato, director of the university’s Center for Politics tweeted.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer released a statement referring to Friday’s rally as a “cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights.”

“Everyone has a right under the First Amendment to express their opinion peaceably, so here’s mine: not only as the Mayor of Charlottesville, but as a UVA faculty member and alumnus, I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus,” he added.

Friday’s march took place shortly after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction allowing right-wing activists to hold Saturday’s rally.

City officials had tried to “modify” the rally’s permit to move the demonstration from the park with the Lee statue more than a mile away to McIntire Park, citing safety concerns.

‘We’re going to start standing up for our history’

In February, the city council voted to remove the Lee statue, but that is on hold pending litigation. The council also voted to rename two city parks that had been named for Confederate generals; one of those, Emancipation Park, was due to be the site of Saturday’s rally.

Saturday’s event had residents on edge, and more than 40 local business owners near the park have asked the city to protect them.

“I have a lot of fears. I think most of us are just anxious, we don’t want there to be violence,” business owner Michael Rodi said of the rally.

“We don’t want to see a bloodbath, we don’t want to see looting, we don’t want to see mass arrests, we don’t want to see the police having to turn on citizens,” he added.

Jason Kessler, who organized Saturday’s “Unite the Right” rally, said he doesn’t consider himself to be a white nationalist. But, he said, “we’re going to start standing up for our history.”

“The statue itself is symbolic of a lot of larger issues. The primary three issues are preserving history against this censorship and revisionism — this political correctness,” he told CNN Friday.

“The second issue is being allowed to advocate for your interests as a white person, just like other groups are allowed to advocate for their interests politically. And finally this is about free speech. We are simply trying to express ourselves and do a demonstration, and the local government has tried to shut us down.”

“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides,” Trump said.

President Trump on Saturday issued a vague condemnation of violence in Charlottesville in a televised statement from New Jersey.

“We have so many incredible things happening in our country. So when I watch Charlottesville, to me it’s very very sad,” Trump said.

“Above all else, we must remember this truth: no matter our color, creed, religion, or political party, we are all Americans first,” he said.

The tweet came after several calls for the president to condemn the rally and violence.

Later on Saturday, the president posted another tweet, calling the situation in Charlottesville “sad.”

In a third tweet, Trump said, “What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.”

Trump has often been criticized for being slow to condemn violence against minorities while highlighting crimes committed by immigrants.

Hours before a noon rally was set to begin Saturday, violent skirmishes broke out between bands of white supremacists and counterprotesters who have converged on this college town around the issue of a Confederate statue.

Local officials declared a state of emergency Saturday, effectively ending the planned rally before it began.

President Donald Trump condemned an ""egregious display of hatred and bigotry"" at the rally, saying there was ""no place"" for violent protests in America.

After the state's governor declared a state of emergency to quell the growing conflict in Charlottesville, Trump said via Twitter that the country ""must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

In the midst of the protest, a Dodge Charger mowed down dozens of peaceful counter-protesters assembled in the area before reversing along the same street.

The suspect was James Alex Fields, Jr., a 20-year-old white man from Ohio, Kumer said. It was not clear why the suspect was in Charlottesville, home to the University of Virginia's flagship campus.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Richmond office said that there will be a civil rights probe into the incident.

A spokesperson for the University of Virginia Hospital cited one death and at least 19 injured, with 5 considered in critical condition.

(CBSNewYork/CBS News/AP) — One person was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters Saturday ahead of a planned white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The deadly crash happened just hours after Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency.

""I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here,"" Signer tweeted. ""I urge all people of good will -- go home.""

Charlottesville officials said a 32-year-old woman was killed while crossing the street and 19 people were injured when a car barreled through an intersection Saturday afternoon.

People ran for safety as the car sped away in reverse, CBS2's Reena Roy reported. Others tended to the victims as they struggled on the sidewalk.

""To really realize that somebody possibly just died in front of us, and it was intentional -- then see the shoes and the pools of blood on the ground and the debris -- I'm still shaking from it right now, just thinking about it,"" witness Joe Ziegler said.

At least 15 other people were hurt in the protests.

Charlottesville police identified the driver as 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., of Ohio.

He was charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident that resulted in death.

Hours later, a Virginia State Police helicopter also crashed in the area, killing two people on board, officials said.

Police said Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates were killed in the crash.

The Bell 407 helicopter crashed seven miles southwest of Charlottesville in Albermale County, the FAA confirmed to CBS News.

Police said the helicopter was assisting law enforcement officers monitoring the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.

""We saw the helicopter kind of go into a spinning, tumbling dive and it went down,"" witness Ben Ward said.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler planned the ""Unite the Right"" rally, or what he called a ""pro-white"" rally, to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park.

Rally supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other before the rally was set to kick off Saturday morning.

Men dressed in militia uniforms were seen carrying shields and openly carrying long guns.

""The 'Unite the Right' ralliers came here looking for battle. They came with weapons, they came with shields, they came with pepper spray and were looking for any opportunity to surround and attack people,"" Ziegler said.

It's the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city, about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C., voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee from a downtown park.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and ""advocating for white people.""

""This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,"" he said in an interview.

Police deemed the gathering unlawful late Saturday morning and told people to disperse or they would be arrested. Officers in riot gear deployed tear gas against the crowd shortly before 11:30 a.m.

Governor McAuliffe declared a state of emergency to aid the state's response shortly before noon, when the rally was set to begin.

""I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours,"" McAuliffe said in a statement. He said state troopers and the Virginia National Guard were providing support to local authorities.

The governor continued to condemn the violence during a press conference Saturday evening.

""I have a message to all the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today. Our message is plain and simple: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth.""

President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump took to Twitter to bemoan the outbreak of violence Saturday.

""We ALL must be united and condemn all that hate stands for,"" the president said. ""There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate (without) hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence,"" the first lady said.

Trump also spoke out from Bedminster, New Jersey later in the day.

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,"" he said.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement, calling the clashes ""violent extremism.""

""What we have seen today has no place in our society. DHS will continue to work closely with our state and local partners across the country to counter violent extremism in all forms,"" the statement read in part.

Meanwhile, New Yorkers rallied in response. Hundreds of people gathered late Saturday afternoon in Union Square in a show of solidarity.

A Black Lives Matter group organized the impromptu rally, and many people carried signs denouncing the white supremacist groups in Charlottesville.

""The white supremacists have taken their hate, violence, and intolerance to the streets, but we will not be intimidated by domestic terrorism,""New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. ""We will continue to fight against the deep-seated racism that exists in our country wherever it appears.""

Between rally attendees and counter-protesters, authorities expected as many as 6,000 people, Charlottesville police said this week.

Among those expected to attend were Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and ""alt-right"" activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.

Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which track extremist groups, said the event had the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.

Officials were preparing for the rally for months. Virginia State Police assisted local authorities, and a spokesman said the Virginia National Guard ""will closely monitor the situation and will be able to rapidly respond and provide additional assistance if needed.""

Police instituted road closures around downtown, and many businesses in the popular open-air shopping mall opted to close for the day.

Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on call.

CBS News reported there was also violence Friday night as a large crowd of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia's campus carrying tiki torches and chanting ""you will not replace us.""

Friday's march began around 10 p.m. at an intramural field, and the crowd proceeded to a statue of President Thomas Jefferson on the UVA campus.

Dozens alt-right activists, white nationalists and neo-Confederates chanted ""white lives matter"" as they faced off against counter-protesters at the statue, CBS affiliate WTVR-TV reports.","One person was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters Saturday ahead of a planned white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia."

President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump took to Twitter to bemoan the outbreak of violence Saturday.

""We ALL must be united and condemn all that hate stands for,"" the president said. ""There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate (without) hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence,"" the first lady said.

Trump also spoke out from Bedminster, New Jersey later in the day.

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,"" he said.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement, calling the clashes ""violent extremism.""

""What we have seen today has no place in our society. DHS will continue to work closely with our state and local partners across the country to counter violent extremism in all forms,"" the statement read in part.

Meanwhile, New Yorkers rallied in response. Hundreds of people gathered late Saturday afternoon in Union Square in a show of solidarity.

A Black Lives Matter group organized the impromptu rally, and many people carried signs denouncing the white supremacist groups in Charlottesville.

""The white supremacists have taken their hate, violence, and intolerance to the streets, but we will not be intimidated by domestic terrorism,""New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. ""We will continue to fight against the deep-seated racism that exists in our country wherever it appears.""

Between rally attendees and counter-protesters, authorities expected as many as 6,000 people, Charlottesville police said this week.

Among those expected to attend were Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and ""alt-right"" activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.

Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which track extremist groups, said the event had the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.

Officials were preparing for the rally for months. Virginia State Police assisted local authorities, and a spokesman said the Virginia National Guard ""will closely monitor the situation and will be able to rapidly respond and provide additional assistance if needed.""

Police instituted road closures around downtown, and many businesses in the popular open-air shopping mall opted to close for the day.

Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on call.

CBS News reported there was also violence Friday night as a large crowd of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia's campus carrying tiki torches and chanting ""you will not replace us.""

Friday's march began around 10 p.m. at an intramural field, and the crowd proceeded to a statue of President Thomas Jefferson on the UVA campus.

Dozens alt-right activists, white nationalists and neo-Confederates chanted ""white lives matter"" as they faced off against counter-protesters at the statue, CBS affiliate WTVR-TV reports.","One person was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters Saturday ahead of a planned white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia."

Supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other on Saturday morning. Men dressed in militia uniforms were carrying shields and openly brandishing automatic rifles.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler planned what he called a ""pro-white"" rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park.

Thousands of people were expected to pack the area.

As reported, there were also fights on Friday night (11 August), when hundreds of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches. A university spokesman said one person was arrested and several people were injured.

On social media, Charlottesville officials said the mass of people gathering at Emancipation Park had been declared as an ""unlawful assembly"".

Local media suggested that at least 1,000 officers were later deployed onto the scene.

The Charlottesville Police Department said: ""City Manager Maurice Jones and Interim County Executive Doug Walker have simultaneously issued a Declaration of Local Emergency.

""This joint declaration allows local officials to request additional resources if needed to respond to ongoing events in the community which are currently localised in downtown Charlottesville.

""Scheduled activities outside the downtown area are not impacted by ongoing events or by this declaration at this time. Local officials continue to closely monitor the situation and will provide additional details as they are available.""

US First Lady Melania Trump tweeted: ""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence.""



President Donald Trump, however, did not immediately comment on the events.



On Friday, an impromptu demonstration resulted in skirmishes at the University of Virginia, after crowds gathered while chanting ""white lives matter"" and ""Jews will not replace us"".

The president of the university campus, Teresa Sullivan, released a statement condemning the protesters' actions. She wrote: ""I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behaviour displayed by torch-bearing protesters that marched on our grounds this evening.

""Law enforcement continues to investigate the incident, and it is my hope that any individuals responsible for criminal acts are held accountable. The violence displayed on grounds is intolerable and is entirely inconsistent with the university's values.""

But the statement may have had little effect, as violence continued to erupt on the streets.

Reporters and journalists, meanwhile, were on-the-ground. NBC News producer Craig Stanley was tweeting live video updates of the scenes, which included mounting clashes.

""We are breaking down and relocating - being hit with tear gas bombs,"" he wrote.

Social media reports showed that armed militia were in attendance at the march in a protest soup which also included a mass of counter-protesters. Exact numbers were unclear.

But between rally attendees and counter-protesters, authorities were expecting as many as 6,000 people, Charlottesville police said this week.

Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city that's home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.

The statue's removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville's history of race is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson.

They're now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.

For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials. A judge has agreed to a temporary injunction that blocks the city from removing the statue for six months.",The 'Unite the Right' rally was declared an 'unlawful assembly' by officials.

Police said the helicopter was assisting law enforcement officers monitoring the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.

Police said Lt. H. Jay Cullen of Midlothian and Trooper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton were killed in the crash.

The crash happened just a few hours after a car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting against the white nationalist rally. One person was killed and at least two dozen were hurt.

This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates' first name. It had been spelled Burke.

Officials say the deaths of two people in a helicopter crash near Charlottesville, Virginia, have been linked to a violent white nationalist rally earlier in the day.

It was not immediately clear how the crash was connected to the rally. Corinne Geller, a Virignia State Police spokeswoman, says the pilot and a passenger were killed in the crash Saturday afternoon.

Jason Kessler said in an interview Saturday evening that whoever drove a car into a group of counter-protesters ""did the wrong thing."" He said he was saddened that people were hurt.

Kessler is a local blogger and activist who described the event as a pro-white rally. He planned it to protest the city's decision to remove a Confederate monument.

He also criticized law enforcement's response to the event, which was dispersed before speakers could take the stage.

He said they did a poor job controlling the chaos to allow free speech.

A state official said the driver of a car that plowed into a group of marchers in Charlottesville is in police custody.

Virginia Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran said the driver, a man, has been arrested.

Hundreds of white nationalists and counter protestors faced off Saturday in downtown Charlottesville, with several violent clashes erupting.

It's the latest confrontation in the city since it voted to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a downtown park.

The NHL's Detroit Red Wings released a statement denouncing the use of their logo at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and saying they are considering legal action to stop it.

The team says it ""vehemently"" disagrees with and is not associated with the event. The Red Wings add they are ""exploring every possible legal action as it pertains to the misuse of our logo in this disturbing demonstration.""

A Michigan-based white nationalist group called the Detroit Right Wings uses the Red Wings' logo. The organization posted on its Twitter account that members had arrived in Charlottesville.

The president was speaking minutes after it was announced that one person has died after being hit by a driver who accelerated into a crowd of counter-protesters in the Virginia city.

He said: 'We condemn this egregious display on bigotry and violence on many sides, it's been going on for a long time in our country.'

Trump also brought up his predecessor Barack Obama during the speech, saying that the United States has been divided for many years.

The president added: 'Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama, it's been going on a long time.'

Police arrested James Alex Fields, 20, in connection with the deadly crash. Fields was charged with second-degree murder Saturday evening.

NBC reporter Hallie Jackson asked the White House what exactly Trump meant by 'on many sides', and it posted a statement on Twitter.

‘The president was condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides,’ the official said. 'There was violence between protesters and counter protesters today.'

Attorney Gen Jeff Sessions also failed to call on white supremacists.

'We stand united behind the President in condemning the violence in Charlottesville and any message of hate and intolerance,' he said in a statement.

'This violence is totally contrary to American values and can never be tolerated.'

Trump also called for a 'swift restoration of law and order' in the small college town during his remarks, saying 'no child should be afraid of going out to play'.

The president said he had just gotten off the phone with Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe and they agreed 'the hate and violence must stop now'.

'We must come together with love for our and true affection - and I say this strongly - for each other.'

Trump then went on a tangent about how the country was doing 'well in so many ways', referencing employment numbers and how 'companies are pouring into our country'.

'We're renegotiating trade deals to make them great for our country and great for the American workers, so many incredible things happening in our country.'

'So when I watch Charlottesville to me it's very, very sad,' Trump added.

'Above else we must remember this truth, no matter or color, creed religion or political party, we are all Americans first.'

'We love our country, we love our god, we love our flag, we’re proud of our country, we’re proud of who we are.'

'So we want to get this situation straightened out in Charlottesville. And we want to study it and we want to see what we’re doing wrong as a country where things like this can happen.'

Trump did not call out white nationalists or the Ku Klux Klan during his remarks. Nor did he call the crash that left one dead an act of domestic terrorism.

KKK leader David Duke previously said on Saturday that the white supremacist demonstrators were 'fulfilling the promises of Donald Trump'.

'That's what we believed in, that's why we voted for Donald Trump. Because he's going to take our country back,' he said.

Earlier on Saturday the president reiterated that 'all' Americans needed to unite and 'condemn all that hate stands for'.

'There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!,' he tweeted.

'Am in Bedminster for meetings & press conference on V.A. & all that we have done, and are doing, to make it better-but Charlottesville sad!'

The First Lady was first to speak out against the rally, which saw white nationalists waving Nazi flags and sporting shirts with Hitler quotes on the UVA campus.

'Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts,' she tweeted. 'No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville.'

Violence erupted ahead of a planned rally where thousands of white nationalists were expected to gather for an alt-right protest.

Two people were seriously injured in the clash, Virginia State police reported.

A video appears to show the altercation - a man can be seen being dragged away by officials while a woman screams: 'Don't allow them to do this!'

Another woman with blood streaming down her face pushes the man away from the scene of the fight.

The Unite the Right rally was being held at Emancipation Park and hundreds were seen stomping through the city, wearing militia uniforms, waving flags and chanting 'Blood and Soil' as they made their way towards the event.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer denounced the 'cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights' and warned for residents to stay away from the rally.

Still, counter-protesters flocked to the march in retaliation against the white nationalists neo-Confederates, and alt-right activists, screaming: 'We're here, we're gay, we fight the KKK!'

A number of politicians have also taken to Twitter to condemn the white nationalists, calling their demonstration 'reprehensible' and 'repugnant'.

'The white nationalist demonstration in #Charlottesville is a reprehensible display of racism and hatred that has no place in our society,' tweeted Bernie Sanders.

'Our nation is defined by the march of progress. Our strength lies in our diversity. We must reject hate. #Charlottesville,' added Nancy Pelosi.

'The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant,' Rep. Paul Ryan wrote. 'Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.'

Former president Bill Clinton added that free speech was not akin to hate speech.

'Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy. #Charlottesville,' he tweeted.

Sen. Patrick Leahy criticized Trump's delay in condemning the demonstration.

'President Trump's silence as #Charlottesvile roils with racist and fascist provocation is shameful, irresponsible...and, DEFINING,' he wrote.

""'White supremacy"" crap is worst kind of racism - it's EVIL and perversion of God's truth to ever think our Creator values some above others,' he tweeted.

The protest hadn't officially started but social media videos showed the rally was escalating - people were seen throwing objects, breaking into fights and pepper spray being used, as officers watched from behind fences.

The violence forced the city to declare a local emergency and determined the event was an unlawful assembly. Tear gas bombs to clear the unruly crowd.

Arrests were made after police in riot gear attempted to clear the park and a group of protesters pushed back against them. However, the battle between the two opposing groups continued to rage in the streets of the city.

Between 4,000 and 6,000 people from groups including white nationalists, neo-Confederates and alt-right activists were expected to protest at the park, which had recently been renamed from Lee Park.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler planned what he called a 'pro-white' rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.

U.S. District Judge Glen Conrad granted a preliminary injunction Friday in a lawsuit filed against Charlottesville by Kessler.

Supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other Saturday morning. Men dressed in militia uniforms were carrying shields and openly carrying long guns.

Social media videos show the crowd throwing bottles and objects as police film the interaction from behind fences but don't intervene.

Brawls broke out as people in militia gear tackled others to the ground and began throwing punches.

Kessler had led a torch lit procession through the University of Virginia campus on Friday night with burning torches, ending at the statue of Thomas Jefferson.

Almost 200 white nationalists, neo-Confederates, and alt-right activists, were heard chanting 'white lives matter' and 'Jews will not replace us'.

They clashed with University of Virginia students who held an anti-racist protest, and were seen holding up signs which read: 'VA students against white supremacists.'",Donald Trump has condemned the violence in Charlottesville - but is coming under fire for speaking about bigotry 'on many sides' and failing to denounce white nationalism.

One person is dead in Charlottesville, Virginia, after a white nationalist rally and counterprotest turned violent and were called off by police, and later a car plowed into a crowd of demonstrators marching down a street, causing injuries.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer tweeted Saturday afternoon ET that ""a life has been lost.""

Video taken earlier in the afternoon show crowds walking down a street as several cars move slowly along the same avenue. Abruptly, a silver or gray vehicle rams into the back of another vehicle, slamming one or more cars ahead of it amid the crowd of protesters. The driver backs up and rapidly flees the scene.

It's unclear at this time whether or not the driver of the vehicle acted intentionally.

The day began with a gathering for an Unite the Right rally backed by white nationalist groups that was supposed to begin at noon. Clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters just before the rally started led to a declaration of emergency in the city and to police in the early afternoon ordering the crowds to disperse.

Charlottesville has become a flash point for both white nationalists and protesters seeking to counter them following a City Council vote in February to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park formerly called Lee Park.

The usually quiet university city of Charlottesville, Virginia, declared a state of emergency Saturday morning after a Unite the Right gathering of far-right extremists began with early, violent clashes with counterprotesters.

The state of Virginia shortly after declared the gathering unlawful and ordered both rallygoers and counterprotesters to ""disperse immediately.""

The Virginia State Police posted videos on Facebook of officers breaking up the Unite the Right gathering and counterprotest. Warning: The videos contain some offensive language and images.

One video shows an officer in announcing to milling crowds: ""This gathering has been declared as to be an unlawful assembly; in the name of the Commonwealth, you are commanded to immediately disperse; if you do not disperse immediately you will be arrested.” Another video shows some of the crowd.

As of about 12:30 p.m., Charlottesville police reported that one person had been arrested and eight people had been treated for injuries by emergency workers.

Saturday's far-right rally and clashes came after a Friday night march by torch-bearing white nationalists on and near the University of Virginia campus, which resulted in brawls with protesters countering the event.

The Unite the Right event Saturday was supposed to begin at noon, but people both in support and opposed to the rally began gathering earlier and by 11 a.m. two people had been treated for serious but non-life-threatening injuries after an altercation at the city's Emancipation Park, according to city officials.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has placed the National Guard on standby in preparation for today's rally, an action he took even before the clashes Friday night.

Torch-wielding white nationalists march on University of Virginia ahead of massive rally

Charlottesville has become a flash point for white nationalists and protesters seeking to counter them since a City Council vote in February to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park formerly called Lee Park but renamed in June as Emancipation Park.

A group opposed to the council's decision sued, and in May a judge issued a six-month injunction against the city's removing the statue while litigation proceeds.

On Friday night, hundreds of white nationalists carrying torches and chanting ""white lives matter,"" ""you will not replace us,"" and the Nazi-associated phrase ""blood and soil"" marched near a statue of Thomas Jefferson on the grounds of the University of Virginia, and were met by counterprotesters.

Police arrived on campus, declared it an unlawful assembly, and ordered the crowds to disperse. University police arrested one person who was charged with assault and disorderly conduct, a university statement Saturday said. ""Several other members of the university community sustained minor injuries during the confrontation.""

University President Teresa A. Sullivan, ""strongly condemned the demonstration,"" the statement said, adding that the ""intimidating and abhorrent behavior displayed by the alt-right protesters was wrong.""

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer called the event ""a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance,"" adding that he was ""beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.""

A mass prayer service was held at St. Paul’s Memorial Church on University Avenue that was organized in response to the rally, according to The Daily Progress, a local paper.

Dr. Cornel West, a prominent leftist philosopher and political activist, spoke at the prayer service, calling the ""Unite the Right"" rally the “biggest gathering of a hate-driven right wing in the history of this country in the last 30 to 35 years,” the Daily Progress reported.

A similar rally in which white supremacists carried tiki torches to protest the removal of that and other statues of Confederate leaders throughout the South took place in May, but today's iteration is expected to be significantly larger--with the number of attendees exceeding 1,000.","The usually quiet university city of Charlottesville, Virginia, declared a state of emergency Saturday morning after a Unite the Right gathering of far-right extremists began with early, violent clashes with counterprotesters."

Lee by the city of Charlottesville. Officials say one person was killed and at least 26 were treated at local hospitals.

One person killed, 19 others injured after car plows into crowd in Charlottesville, VA, city says.

One person is dead in Charlottesville, Virginia, after a white nationalist rally and counterprotest turned violent and were called off by police, and later a car plowed into a crowd of demonstrators marching down a street, causing injuries.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer tweeted Saturday afternoon ET that ""a life has been lost.""

Video taken earlier in the afternoon show crowds walking down a street as several cars move slowly along the same avenue. Abruptly, a silver or gray vehicle rams into the back of another vehicle, slamming one or more cars ahead of it amid the crowd of protesters. The driver backs up and rapidly flees the scene.

It's unclear at this time whether or not the driver of the vehicle acted intentionally.

The day began with a gathering for an Unite the Right rally backed by white nationalist groups that was supposed to begin at noon. Clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters just before the rally started led to a declaration of emergency in the city and to police in the early afternoon ordering the crowds to disperse.

Charlottesville has become a flash point for both white nationalists and protesters seeking to counter them following a City Council vote in February to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park formerly called Lee Park.

The park was renamed Emancipation Park in June.

President Donald Trump addressed clashing protesters in Charlottesville, Saturday, tweeting: ""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

The usually quiet university city of Charlottesville, Virginia, declared a state of emergency Saturday morning after a Unite the Right gathering of far-right extremists began with early, violent clashes with counterprotesters.

The state of Virginia shortly after declared the gathering unlawful and ordered both rallygoers and counterprotesters to ""disperse immediately.""

The Virginia State Police posted videos on Facebook of officers breaking up the Unite the Right gathering and counterprotest. Warning: The videos contain some offensive language and images.

One video shows an officer in announcing to milling crowds: ""This gathering has been declared as to be an unlawful assembly; in the name of the Commonwealth, you are commanded to immediately disperse; if you do not disperse immediately you will be arrested.” Another video shows some of the crowd.

As of about 12:30 p.m., Charlottesville police reported that one person had been arrested and eight people had been treated for injuries by emergency workers.

Saturday's far-right rally and clashes came after a Friday night march by torch-bearing white nationalists on and near the University of Virginia campus, which resulted in brawls with protesters countering the event.

The Unite the Right event Saturday was supposed to begin at noon, but people both in support and opposed to the rally began gathering earlier and by 11 a.m. two people had been treated for serious but non-life-threatening injuries after an altercation at the city's Emancipation Park, according to city officials.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has placed the National Guard on standby in preparation for today's rally, an action he took even before the clashes Friday night.

Torch-wielding white nationalists march on University of Virginia ahead of massive rally

Charlottesville has become a flash point for white nationalists and protesters seeking to counter them since a City Council vote in February to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park formerly called Lee Park but renamed in June as Emancipation Park.

A group opposed to the council's decision sued, and in May a judge issued a six-month injunction against the city's removing the statue while litigation proceeds.

On Friday night, hundreds of white nationalists carrying torches and chanting ""white lives matter,"" ""you will not replace us,"" and the Nazi-associated phrase ""blood and soil"" marched near a statue of Thomas Jefferson on the grounds of the University of Virginia, and were met by counterprotesters.

Police arrived on campus, declared it an unlawful assembly, and ordered the crowds to disperse. University police arrested one person who was charged with assault and disorderly conduct, a university statement Saturday said. ""Several other members of the university community sustained minor injuries during the confrontation.""

University President Teresa A. Sullivan, ""strongly condemned the demonstration,"" the statement said, adding that the ""intimidating and abhorrent behavior displayed by the alt-right protesters was wrong.""

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer called the event ""a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance,"" adding that he was ""beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.""

A mass prayer service was held at St. Paul’s Memorial Church on University Avenue that was organized in response to the rally, according to The Daily Progress, a local paper.

Dr. Cornel West, a prominent leftist philosopher and political activist, spoke at the prayer service, calling the ""Unite the Right"" rally the “biggest gathering of a hate-driven right wing in the history of this country in the last 30 to 35 years,” the Daily Progress reported.

A similar rally in which white supremacists carried tiki torches to protest the removal of that and other statues of Confederate leaders throughout the South took place in May, but today's iteration is expected to be significantly larger--with the number of attendees exceeding 1,000.","The usually quiet university city of Charlottesville, Virginia, declared a state of emergency Saturday morning after a Unite the Right gathering of far-right extremists began with early, violent clashes with counterprotesters."

Terry McAuliffe has declared a state of emergency Saturday after hundreds of people faced off ahead of a white nationalist protest.

The incident happened before a ""Unite the Right"" rally that had been set in Charlottesville, Virgina, to protest the town's plan to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in a local park.

Supporters and counter-protesters butted heads, leading to an ugly scene in the city's downtown area.

But a separate group of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia carrying tiki torches for the same cause Friday night, an act that drew much criticism and mockery throughout social media amid the tense situation.

Here are some examples:

A university spokesperson said that one person was arrested and that several others were injured during the campus demonstration.



The clashes took a tragic turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters peacefully demonstrating against the planned white nationalist rally in the city, killing one person and injuring at least 26.

Secretary Perry has blown off the talk, for several reasons, not the least of which is that it’s still early to be stating anything as certain.

A new report from Bloomberg, however, citing several sources, is suggesting that there is already another name lined up to take over as Secretary of Energy: Democrat Senator Joe Manchin, of West Virginia.

Some White House and Republican officials are exploring the idea of putting West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin in charge of the Energy Department, according to four people familiar with the discussions, a move that could boost President Donald Trump’s stalled legislative agenda. If Manchin were offered and accepted the position, that would allow West Virginia’s Governor Jim Justice — a newly minted Republican — to appoint a GOP successor and bring the party a vote closer in the Senate to being able to repeal Obamacare. The idea is in the early stages of consideration, and it’s unclear whether it has support within the administration, according to the people, who described the conversations under condition of anonymity.

Reports are that Manchin was initially considered for the spot now held by Rick Perry, but that talks fell through when Trump wouldn’t assure him he could pick his own staff. Picking him now would be a game-changer though.

Democrats would obviously put huge pressure on Manchin not to allow the change of a seat from D to R in the Senate since it would dramatically alter the landscape on tight issues, like Repeal & Replace for the glaring, elephant-in-the-room example.

The Right Scoop points out the other intensely apparent fact, that West Virginia is bigly Trump territory, where he won huge in the election (every county). Manchin, Bloomberg reminds, stays alive in that environment by styling himself as different from the partisans.

Manchin has sought to position himself as a political independent. In a recent interview with the Charleston Gazette-Mail that he won’t commit to Democratic policy positions just to win re-election. “The bottom line is, if it doesn’t help West Virginia, it doesn’t make sense to me,” Manchin told the newspaper. “Just because there’s an election doesn’t mean I sign on or don’t sign on,”

Manchin is facing a tough reelection bid in 2018. He can stay and fight, or he can jump to a Cabinet position and avoid being sent home in the midterm.

Also, the Right Scoop had another interesting fact to chew on. Manchin’s last tweet before this post was praise for Trump.",

Mr. Trump tweeted that all Americans must condemn hate and violence, without mentioning the Charlottesville incident directly. The ""Unite the Right"" rally erupted into chaos Saturday morning, resulting in fights, tear gas and injuries and prompting Virginia's governor to declare a state of emergency. Some in the crowds featured Nazi symbols and spewed anti-Semitic rhetoric.

First lady Melania Trump responded to the violence before the president did. Mr. Trump is currently on a 17-day working vacation in Bedminster, New Jersey. The ""Unite the Right"" rally was originally a reaction to the removal of a statute of confederate general Robert E. Lee from a public park.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan issued a statement condemning the ""vile bigotry"" just before noon.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) called on the country to reject hate.

But Mr. Trump's delayed response was quickly noticed by Democrats in Congress.

While Democrats were generally quicker to respond to the Charlottesville violence on Twitter, Republicans also condemned the day's events. Rep. Justin Amash (R-Michigan) called for Americans to stand against racism.

Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colorado) said the ""hate"" spewed in Charlottesville is ""un-American.""

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Washington), chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, explicitly called out white supremacy and its supporters.

After a morning of violent clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters, police ordered hundreds of people out of a downtown park, putting an end to a noon rally before it even began. Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency shortly before 11 a.m., blaming the violence on “mostly out-of-state protesters.” “I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours,” McAuliffe (D) said. Other elected leaders in Virginia and elsewhere also urged peace, blasting the white supremacist views on display in Charlottesville as ugly. U.S. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) called their display “repugnant.”

Repugnant, Paul? Was it any more repugnant than when your hero, Ronald Reagan, held his own hate rally in Philadelphia, Mississippi, 37 years ago this month, where he proclaimed his belief in “state’s rights?” Was it any more repugnant than when George H. W. Bush shamelessly stoked racial fears in his 1988 presidential campaign? Was it any more repugnant than when Jesse Helms convinced white voters in North Carolina that nonwhites were taking all the good jobs in 1990? Was it any more repugnant than when Rush Limbaugh proclaimed in 2010 that the Affordable Care Act was a form of reparations?

No wonder Republicans like Ryan are embarrassed by the chaos in Charlottesville. Their party stoked this hatred for decades, going all the way back to Barry Goldwater’s resistance to the Civil Rights Act 53 years ago.

(AP) — A car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally Saturday in a Virginia college town, killing one person, sending at least 26 others to hospitals and ratcheting up tension in an increasingly violent confrontation.

The chaos boiled over at what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade: the governor declared a state of emergency, police dressed in riot gear ordered people out and helicopters circled overhead. The group had gathered to protest plans to remove a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and others who arrived to protest the racism.

Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said several hundred counter-protesters were marching when “suddenly there was just this tire screeching sound.” A silver Dodge Challenger smashed into another car, then backed up, barreling through “a sea of people.”

The impact hurled people into the air. Those left standing scattered, screaming and running for safety in different directions.

The driver was later arrested, authorities said.

The turbulence began Friday night, when the white nationalists carried torches though the university campus in what they billed as a “pro-white” demonstration. It quickly spiraled into violence Saturday morning. Hundreds of people threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. At least eight were injured and one arrested in connection.

President Donald Trump condemned “in the strongest possible terms” what he called an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” after the clashes. He called for “a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.”

Trump says he’s spoken with the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, and “we agreed that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now.”

But some of the white nationalists cited Trump’s victory as validation for their beliefs, and Trump’s critics pointed to the president’s racially tinged rhetoric as exploiting the nation’s festering racial tension.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson noted that Trump for years publicly questioned President Barack Obama’s citizenship.

“We are in a very dangerous place right now,” he said.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a “pro-white” rally in Charlottesville. White nationalists and their opponents promoted the event for weeks.

Oren Segal, who directs the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said multiple white power groups gathered in Charlottesville, including members of neo-Nazi organizations, racist skinhead groups and Ku Klux Klan factions.

The white nationalist organizations Vanguard America and Identity Evropa; the Southern nationalist League of the South; the National Socialist Movement; the Traditionalist Workers Party; and the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights also were on hand, he said, along with several groups with a smaller presence.

On the other side, anti-fascist demonstrators also gathered in Charlottesville, but they generally aren’t organized like white nationalist factions, said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Many others were just locals caught in the fray.

Colleen Cook, 26, stood on a curb shouting at the rally attendees to go home.

Cook, a teacher who attended the University of Virginia, said she sent her son, who is black, out of town for the weekend.

“This isn’t how he should have to grow up,” she said.

Cliff Erickson leaned against a fence and took in the scene. He said he thinks removing the statue amounts to erasing history and said the “counter-protesters are crazier than the alt-right.”

“Both sides are hoping for a confrontation,” he said.

It’s the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C., voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and “advocating for white people.”

“This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,” he said in an interview.

Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer said he was disgusted that the white nationalists had come to his town and blamed Trump for inflaming racial prejudices.

“I’m not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you’re seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president,” he said.

Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city that’s home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.

The statue’s removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville’s history of race is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. They’re now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.

For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials. A judge has agreed to temporarily block the city from removing the statue for six months.","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.

State officials tell the Associated Press that the driver of the car was arrested.

Charlottesville Police identified the woman who was killed asHeather Heyer, 32, of Charlottesville. Police say she was taken to UVA Hospital where she was pronounced dead.

Virginia State Police said that multiple people were hit by the car and hospitalized. Five of the injured were in serious condition and four were critical condition.



On Sunday, the University of Virginia Heath System says 9 people injured were discharged and the other 10 are in good condition.

Police were called to the scene of the crash in thearea of Water and 4th Streets. Two other vehicles were hit by the car which then backed up down the street and fled.



The driver, later identified as James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, is now in police custody.

Fields has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and once count of hit-and-run attended failure to stop with injury, according to officials at the Albermarle County Regional Jail.



The white nationalist ""Unite the Right"" rally brought hundreds to Charlottesville both to support and oppose the rally for the local Robert E. Lee statue. Police say at least two people were seriously injured during the rally and CNN, the Associated Press and the Washington Post reported multiple fights breaking out.

Secretary Perry has blown off the talk, for several reasons, not the least of which is that it’s still early to be stating anything as certain.

A new report from Bloomberg, however, citing several sources, is suggesting that there is already another name lined up to take over as Secretary of Energy: Democrat Senator Joe Manchin, of West Virginia.

Some White House and Republican officials are exploring the idea of putting West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin in charge of the Energy Department, according to four people familiar with the discussions, a move that could boost President Donald Trump’s stalled legislative agenda. If Manchin were offered and accepted the position, that would allow West Virginia’s Governor Jim Justice — a newly minted Republican — to appoint a GOP successor and bring the party a vote closer in the Senate to being able to repeal Obamacare. The idea is in the early stages of consideration, and it’s unclear whether it has support within the administration, according to the people, who described the conversations under condition of anonymity.

Reports are that Manchin was initially considered for the spot now held by Rick Perry, but that talks fell through when Trump wouldn’t assure him he could pick his own staff. Picking him now would be a game-changer though.

Democrats would obviously put huge pressure on Manchin not to allow the change of a seat from D to R in the Senate since it would dramatically alter the landscape on tight issues, like Repeal & Replace for the glaring, elephant-in-the-room example.

The Right Scoop points out the other intensely apparent fact, that West Virginia is bigly Trump territory, where he won huge in the election (every county). Manchin, Bloomberg reminds, stays alive in that environment by styling himself as different from the partisans.

Manchin has sought to position himself as a political independent. In a recent interview with the Charleston Gazette-Mail that he won’t commit to Democratic policy positions just to win re-election. “The bottom line is, if it doesn’t help West Virginia, it doesn’t make sense to me,” Manchin told the newspaper. “Just because there’s an election doesn’t mean I sign on or don’t sign on,”

Manchin is facing a tough reelection bid in 2018. He can stay and fight, or he can jump to a Cabinet position and avoid being sent home in the midterm.

Also, the Right Scoop had another interesting fact to chew on. Manchin’s last tweet before this post was praise for Trump.",

The gathering turned violent before noon, as waves of arriving white nationalist marchers armed with cudgels and carrying shields met with heckles and projectiles from counterprotesters who sought to block their route.

Governor Terry McAuliffe (D-VA) declared a state of emergency “to aid state response to violence” at the rally. National Guard could be seen, as well as state police. The city of Charlottesville also declared a local emergency, which allows it to access additional resources to respond to the conflict. Late Friday night, a judge granted the white nationalist group permission to rally in protest of the city’s decision to take down a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park.

As the crowd built up outside the park where the rally was to be held, minor scuffles started breaking out between counter protesters – a mix of silent prayer, Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist – knowns as “antifa” – and the KKK-like group promoting white supremacy.

The park entrance where the worst of the violence erupted had earlier in the day been blocked by clergy in religious robes, members of a separate nonviolent resistance protest against the hate rally. Standing two and three deep, shoulder to shoulder, the clergy eventually gave way in the face of a concerted forward march by the white power vanguard with their shields.

A tense scene had pervaded for hours Saturday morning, with occasional small scuffles here and there, but it was not until around 11 o’clock that the violence fully broke out.

Virginia state troopers shut down two corners of the park where the rally was to be held. This left open two staircase entrances on the other two corners along Market Street, with barriers guiding rallygoers single-file into the park.

At one of those two entrances, a group of heavily armed, unidentified militiamen stood by the groups of white nationalists, while a group of antifa counterprotesters sought to rile them up. State police stood above, between metal barriers at the edge of the park, watching.

At the other entrance a group of clergy stood two deep at the top of the stairs, seeking to block passage. But after the corner below erupted in clashes, the group was forced to stand aside as white nationalists filed up this staircase and made it into the park. It was unclear if the clergy resisted.

From that new vantage point, Unite the Right rallygoers began throwing water bottles back at the antifa group that had begun flinging bottles, balloons, and other objects. ThinkProgress reporter Joshua Eaton also noted that protesters, armed with homemade shields, were using mace and pepper spray on each other.

Between these two entrances, a fight began between antifa counterprotesters and white nationalists, focused near the corner where this ThinkProgress Facebook Live video took place, there have been fights as well as bottles and smoking cannisters thrown.

Throughout all of this, the Virginia state troopers stayed off to the side, not intervening, as they have almost the entire area cordoned off.

After the Facebook Live video, ThinkProgress reporter Alan Pyke watched a smoking cannister fired from the group of white supremacists in the park into the group of counterprotesters.

Then a white nationalist organizer in the park announced through a bullhorn that the rally had been deemed an unlawful assembly and they’ve been ordered to disperse. A Charlottesville police officer then confirmed this through a megaphone and ordered everyone to disperse. Fights continued to spasm through the crowd for another half hour as most filed away through the streets open to them.

Eaton, standing one block away from the park, said that while riot police used a small amount of tear gas to clear the gathering, they initially allowed protesters to gather in nearby intersections and streets.

“Protests have now largely moved to the side streets,” said Eaton who could see hundreds of protesters in the two blocks around the park after the rally was disbursed.

The “scores” of riot police started to line up at the 1st Street intersection near the park and started to push protesters out of the streets.

Observing the tense scene leading up the march, Eaton and Pyke initially noted the sparse police presence there.

The white supremacists also marched through the campus of the University of Virginia on Friday night, seemingly setting the tone for Saturday. Eaton reported:

Earlier this week, Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Trump, told Breitbart News that people should stop criticizing white supremacists so much.

JoAnn Young, wife of defendant Lonnie Medlin, and mother of victim Patrick ""Pat"" Wescott, 44, was called to the witness stand by Commonwealth’s Attorney Spencer Morgan. After hearing a testimony from Young and a police investigator, the judge made his ruling on Aug. 11.

“I cannot think of a theory that would say this was not a justified shooting,” opined Juvenile and Domestic Relations Judge Croxton Gordon. “He was in a rage, he was physically violent, he threw the bottle of Powerade. Medlin came out of the bedroom with a gun. Wescott was charging Ms. Young, swinging his fists. One blow could have injured her. I dismiss both charges.”

Medlin had been charged with second-degree murder and use of a firearm.

Wescott had a history of drug use, crimes and incarcerations In Virginia, and more recently in Florida, where he got into trouble after absconding in violation of his probation hearing.

Young tearfully testified in Accomack General District Court about the events of the early morning of April 1 that resulted in her son shot dead and her husband charged in his murder. Young said her son and his girlfriend were living in her home at the time.

She said Medlin, 67, was the first to awake that morning. It was before 5 a.m., and he went outside to smoke a cigarette.

A short time later, he came back to bed and told Young that he saw Wescott's girlfriend in the living room, appearing to have passed out on a loveseat with a lit cigarette.

Medlin said he pulled on her arm and shook her shoulder, in an attempt to wake her as the cigarette burned the loveseat. Medlin told his wife he called the woman ""crazy"" and said, ""You are burning up my loveseat.""

Wescott barged into their bedroom and grabbed Medlin, shaking him, Young said. “He was screaming that Lonnie had no right to put his hands on anyone.”

In the living room, Young then found her son cursing and violently ripping the love seat to pieces.

“I was doing everything I could to get him to stop,” she said.

Young testified that Wescott raised his voice at her and said, “You picked him over me again!”

Wescott then went back into the bedroom a second time and again grabbed Medlin, shaking him violently, causing him to hit his head on the headboard.

“I have never seen my son in that much rage. I knew something terrible was going to happen,” Young said, crying.

She said Wescott returned to the living room and the shouting continued.

“He was bound and determined to hurt someone that morning,” she said.

Young repeated what she called, “his very ugly language.”

""I will kill both of you,"" Young said, repeating her son. ""You can call police, but I’ll kill both of you before the police get here.""

She said her son picked up an unopened bottle of Powerade and threw it at her. It missed her, hit the wall and burst open, she told the court.

“I didn’t know Lonnie was behind me,"" she said.

Young said her son was coming toward her yelling threats. She looked down and said she saw the barrel of a gun near her thigh, heard a shot and saw her son clutch his side.

“He staggered backwards and fell to the floor,” she said.

She described the entire altercation as occurring “in a split second.”

Young said her son’s girlfriend came into the room and performed CPR. Medlin checked his stepson and found no pulse.

“He’s gone,” Medlin told them, according to Young's testimony.

Medlin went to his bedroom, laid the gun on the bed and changed his clothes, according to Young's testimony. He unloaded the gun, took it onto the deck, put it on a table and sat on the steps to wait for the police to arrive.

When defense attorney Carl Bundick questioned Young about her son, she said he had been released from the Eastern Shore regional jail about six weeks earlier.

He had a construction job in Ocean City that she drove him to because he had no driver's license, Young said.

Despite Wescott's long history of drug abuse, he seemed clean until two weeks before his death, when Young began to suspect that he was again using drugs, she testified.

His drug use was verified when Young said Wescott recently showed her his arm, saying, “I really messed up. I tried to shoot up and missed the vein.”

“He was reverting back to his old self. He was like he was when he was using drugs,” she said. “The more he took, the meaner he got.”

She told the court she feared that he would kill or seriously hurt her and her husband.

“I’ve never seen my son like that before,"" she said. ""He was like a mad man.”

""This is a circumstance that is clearly defense of self and defense of others,” said the defense attorney. “On two occasions, Medlin was physically assaulted and manhandled.""

Wescott's threats to kill the couple and his drug use heightened their fear.

""They were anticipating serious bodily harm,” Bundick said.","The murder charge against Lonnie Medlin of New Church, Virginia, was dropped in the shooting death of stepson, Pat Wescott."

Clashes broke out on Saturday morning in the Emancipation Park area, in Charlottesville city -- about 100 miles outside of Washington, DC.

Several people were injured and an unspecified number of others were arrested. Officials said two people were treated already for serious injuries.

Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency “to aid state response to violence” at the rally.

Police anticipated some 2,000 to 6,000 people, including counter-demonstrators, will converge in the city.

The city officials, who declared the gathering an ""unlawful assembly,"" declared a local emergency.

Meanwhile, a vehicle plowed into a group of people who were rallying through downtown Charlottesville.

At least one person was seen on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately afterward the incident.

A witness said one girl got ""tore up"" after the car ""backed up and they hit again."" The incident occurred as hundreds had descended on the normally tranquil city of Charlottesville either to take part in or voice condemnation for a far-right rally that quickly erupted in violence.

More than 500 white supremacists already left the Emancipation Park area after fights broke out between them and counter protesters.

Riot police, wearing gas masks, are working to disperse the crowd, while helicopters are flying overhead, but the situation is being deteriorated as thousands of protesters are still arriving into the area.

Police said people were throwing bottles at each other and firing pepper spray at other demonstrators.

President Donald Trump took to Twitter once again and condemned the ongoing violence.

“We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one,"" he tweeted.

The rally was organized by a far right group to protest a plan to remove a statue of General Robert E. Lee and call for the protection of Southern Confederate monuments.

Back in February, the City Council voted to remove the statue of Lee, who was leading southern forces against the Union Army in the American Civil War. He has been venerated as a heroic figure in the South.

In response to the nationalist rally, local demonstrators and anti-racist activists from all over the country were called to Charlottesville from all over the country to oppose the event.

Among the opposing groups, Black Lives Matter and SURJ (Showing up for Racial Justice) campaigners will also be attending the rally.

The Southern Poverty Law Center said the event could be the ""largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States.

According to the city Manager Maurice Jones, approximately 1,000 law enforcement officers and first responders, including the largest deployment by Virginia State Police in 30 years, will be on site of the rally.

Clashes erupted between hundreds of white nationalists, who were carrying blazing torches, with counter-demonstrators at the University of Virginia campus Friday night.

The marchers were chanting slogans including ""white lives matter"" and ""you will not replace us."" Nazi expression like “blood and soil” could also be heard in the rally.

Walking through the campus, the nationalists were met by the counter-protesters and a brief scuffle broke out between the two groups.

People in both groups started throwing punches and pushing each other.

Police, who were arrived to break up the clashes, sprayed chemical irritant into the protesters.

At least one person was arrested and several on campus were treated for minor injuries.","Violent clashes have erupted between thousands of white supremacists and counter-protesters in the southern state of Virginia, leaving several people injured.

Throughout all of this, the Virginia state troopers stayed off to the side, not intervening, as they have almost the entire area cordoned off.

After the Facebook Live video, ThinkProgress reporter Alan Pyke watched a smoking cannister fired from the group of white supremacists in the park into the group of counterprotesters.

Then a white nationalist organizer in the park announced through a bullhorn that the rally had been deemed an unlawful assembly and they’ve been ordered to disperse. A Charlottesville police officer then confirmed this through a megaphone and ordered everyone to disperse. Fights continued to spasm through the crowd for another half hour as most filed away through the streets open to them.

Eaton, standing one block away from the park, said that while riot police used a small amount of tear gas to clear the gathering, they initially allowed protesters to gather in nearby intersections and streets.

“Protests have now largely moved to the side streets,” said Eaton who could see hundreds of protesters in the two blocks around the park after the rally was disbursed.

The “scores” of riot police started to line up at the 1st Street intersection near the park and started to push protesters out of the streets.

Observing the tense scene leading up the march, Eaton and Pyke initially noted the sparse police presence there.

The white supremacists also marched through the campus of the University of Virginia on Friday night, seemingly setting the tone for Saturday. Eaton reported:

Earlier this week, Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Trump, told Breitbart News that people should stop criticizing white supremacists so much.

Watch below for scenes from the rally:","The rally was declared an ""unlawful assembly"" by police who forced everyone to disperse from the park."

Clashes broke out on Saturday morning in the Emancipation Park area, in Charlottesville city -- about 100 miles outside of Washington, DC.

Several people were injured and an unspecified number of others were arrested. Officials said two people were treated already for serious injuries.

Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency “to aid state response to violence” at the rally.

Police anticipated some 2,000 to 6,000 people, including counter-demonstrators, will converge in the city.

The city officials, who declared the gathering an ""unlawful assembly,"" declared a local emergency.

Meanwhile, a vehicle plowed into a group of people who were rallying through downtown Charlottesville.

At least one person was seen on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately afterward the incident.

A witness said one girl got ""tore up"" after the car ""backed up and they hit again."" The incident occurred as hundreds had descended on the normally tranquil city of Charlottesville either to take part in or voice condemnation for a far-right rally that quickly erupted in violence.

More than 500 white supremacists already left the Emancipation Park area after fights broke out between them and counter protesters.

Riot police, wearing gas masks, are working to disperse the crowd, while helicopters are flying overhead, but the situation is being deteriorated as thousands of protesters are still arriving into the area.

Police said people were throwing bottles at each other and firing pepper spray at other demonstrators.

President Donald Trump took to Twitter once again and condemned the ongoing violence.

“We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one,"" he tweeted.

The rally was organized by a far right group to protest a plan to remove a statue of General Robert E. Lee and call for the protection of Southern Confederate monuments.

Back in February, the City Council voted to remove the statue of Lee, who was leading southern forces against the Union Army in the American Civil War. He has been venerated as a heroic figure in the South.

In response to the nationalist rally, local demonstrators and anti-racist activists from all over the country were called to Charlottesville from all over the country to oppose the event.

Among the opposing groups, Black Lives Matter and SURJ (Showing up for Racial Justice) campaigners will also be attending the rally.

The Southern Poverty Law Center said the event could be the ""largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States.

According to the city Manager Maurice Jones, approximately 1,000 law enforcement officers and first responders, including the largest deployment by Virginia State Police in 30 years, will be on site of the rally.

Clashes erupted between hundreds of white nationalists, who were carrying blazing torches, with counter-demonstrators at the University of Virginia campus Friday night.

The marchers were chanting slogans including ""white lives matter"" and ""you will not replace us."" Nazi expression like “blood and soil” could also be heard in the rally.

Walking through the campus, the nationalists were met by the counter-protesters and a brief scuffle broke out between the two groups.

People in both groups started throwing punches and pushing each other.

Police, who were arrived to break up the clashes, sprayed chemical irritant into the protesters.

At least one person was arrested and several on campus were treated for minor injuries.","Violent clashes have erupted between thousands of white supremacists and counter-protesters in the southern state of Virginia, leaving several people injured.

The reality, of course, is white men have dominated America throughout its history. White Americans beat their black and Latino counterparts in terms of wealth, income, and educational attainment. All US presidents but one have been white men, and the current Congress — supposedly the most diverse in history — remains dominated by white and male legislators.

White people in North America live in a social environment that protects and insulates them from race-based stress. This insulated environment of racial protection builds white expectations for racial comfort while at the same time lowering the ability to tolerate racial stress, leading to what I refer to as White Fragility. White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium.

DiAngelo’s paper explained that white Americans have a range of “triggers” that can make them defensive about race, from suggestions that a person’s viewpoint is racialized to the rise of people of color into prominent leadership positions. All the triggers she listed were present in the past year — through the presidency of Barack Obama, President Donald Trump’s racist rhetoric, and Black Lives Matter protests against the dominance of white privilege.

Consider how often throughout the 2016 election people would respond to even the slightest suggestion of racism, whether in media or everyday life, with immediate vitriol, disdain, or dismissal. This, DiAngelo argued, is a defense mechanism to confronting questions about privilege. And it makes it difficult to have a reasonable conversation about race, effectively perpetuating a status quo favorable to white Americans by averting discussions about how to change the existing circumstances.

One of the white participants left the session and went back to her desk, upset at receiving (what appeared to the training team as) sensitive and diplomatic feedback on how some of her statements had impacted several people of color in the room. At break, several other white participants approached us (the trainers) and reported that they had talked to the woman at her desk, and she was very upset that her statements had been challenged. They wanted to alert us to the fact that she literally “might be having a heart-attack.” Upon questioning from us, they clarified that they meant this literally. These co-workers were sincere in their fear that the young woman might actually physically die as a result of the feedback. Of course, when news of the woman’s potentially fatal condition reached the rest of the participant group, all attention was immediately focused back onto her and away from the impact she had had on the people of color.

This illustrates just how defensive people can get in the face of accusations of racism: Not only did the woman who faced the criticisms genuinely feel like she was having a heart attack, but the white people around her believed it was totally possible she was. This is the reality of trying to have a conversation that challenges white privilege in America.

You can apply this concept to what we see this weekend in Charlottesville. Many of the people involved have likely led advantaged lives — just because they’re white men in a society that has historically given them more rights than everyone else.

But they’ve seen their racial security challenged. They saw the first black president with Barack Obama. They see demographic statistics that show white Americans will no longer be the majority in the coming decades. They see all of this talk about Black Lives Matter and the importance of diversity, including through policies like affirmative action. They see recent moves to tear down Confederate monuments in the South. And they themselves may have been accused of racism at some point in their lives, perhaps after they raised concerns about any of these issues.",Here’s why white men are acting like the victims in Charlottesville.

Trump’s tough rhetoric against North Korea – which received new sanctions from the UN Security Council for continuing its intercontinental ballistic missile tests – has generated varied reactions in the US and many parts of the world. “Pacifists” have expressed alarm, saying the “apocalyptic outbursts” and “bombastic” attitude of the US president could only exacerbate tensions and make things worse.

Undoubtedly, there are also many Americans who are convinced that adopting a tougher stance is the only way to deal with North Korea whose belligerent leader Kim Jong Un has been continuously issuing threats and insults against the United States. Prior to Trump’s “fire and fury” warning, a North Korean mouthpiece had written, “…the day the US dares tease our nation with a nuclear rod and sanctions, the mainland US will be catapulted into an unimaginable sea of fire.”

A lot of Americans including right-wing liberals and even “white supremacists” agree that playing nice is not going to make the situation any better either, echoing Florida Senator Marco Rubio’s tweet that attacks against Trump are “ridiculous” because North Korea would not act any differently even if the US president used “nicer words.”

Sebastian Gorka, one of Trump’s national security advisers, was even more blunt, saying that the US is “not giving in to nuclear blackmail any longer.” As US State Secretary Rex Tillerson also put it, Trump is “sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong Un would understand, because he doesn’t seem to understand diplomatic language.”

Despite the verbal warfare, back channel diplomacy is being quietly pursued via the “New York Channel” – the same diplomatic track that was used to secure the release of US college student Otto Warmbier who had been detained for 18 months in North Korea before he was released (but already comatose) in June this year.

The situation reminds us of the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, the biggest test for the leadership of President John F. Kennedy, when the US and the Soviet Union came so close to a nuclear war because of the installation of Russian nuclear missiles in Cuba – located just 90 miles from Florida. It came about after an American U-2 surveillance aircraft passing over Cuba took photos of a Soviet SS-4 medium range ballistic missile already being assembled.

What followed was a tense two weeks of military standoff, with JFK going live on TV to tell Americans that the US is prepared to use military force if necessary to protect the American people from the danger posed by the Soviet Union.

Millions of Americans especially those from the mid-west are ecstatic that they now have a president who is sticking up for their nation and its friends and allies. President Trump made it clear in no uncertain terms that Kim Jong Un will “truly regret it fast” if he utters an overt threat – which Kim and his family have been doing for years – directed against Guam, or any American territory or ally for that matter.

One of Trump’s avid supporters was even quoted as saying that “it’s about time somebody stood up to those who have been pushing us around especially with the kind of firepower we have,” even re-tweeting the US Pacific Command Twitter post that declared, “#USAF B-1B Lancer #bombers on Guam stand ready to fulfill USFK’s #FightTonight mission if called upon to do so.”

The world was given a peek of the kind of military arsenal the US has at its disposal when two B-1B bombers conducted aerial maneuvers with South Korean fighter jets over the Korean Peninsula, displaying their attack capabilities following North Korea’s firing of an ICBM early in July. The US also tested its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in Alaska – successfully detecting, tracking and intercepting a mid-range ballistic missile that was launch-tested over the Pacific Ocean.

In terms of military firepower, there is no doubt the United States has formidable fighting strength – 2,300 fighter aircraft, 2,800 attack planes, over 6,000 choppers (about 1,000 of them attack helicopters), more than 41,000 armored fighting vehicles, 19 aircraft carriers, 70 submarines and over 60 destroyers. Three weeks ago, the US commissioned the USS Gerald Ford – the $13 billion, state-of-the-art warship that Donald Trump said was America’s 100,000-ton strong message to the world that will make enemies shake in fear.

The US military believes that being ahead is the only way for it to maintain the balance of power in the world – thus, it has continued over the years to develop highly sophisticated and technologically advanced military hardware like the F-22 Raptors, F-35 Lightning II, B-2 Spirit bombers, Virginia-class submarines, micro-and stealth drones and hypersonic missiles, to name a few.

A source in the Pentagon told us that US technology is “light years ahead of everyone,” adding that there are other “secret weapons” which will be revealed when “absolutely necessary.” Clearly, President Trump’s warnings are “neither nonsense nor shallow,” our source said.

Undoubtedly, we are facing one of the most volatile times in history – and all nations should stand together against any threat to global stability and security. President Duterte’s meeting with US State Secretary Rex Tillerson was perfect timing when the president assured our American friends by saying, “I am your humble friend in Southeast Asia.”","After telling North Korea that it will be met with “fire, fury and power” the likes of which the world has never seen, US president Donald Trump issued an even stronger warning that the US military is “locked and loaded” should the Asian nation choose to “act unwisely.”

An alleged MS-13 gang member on the FBI's ""10 Most Wanted"" list was captured Friday, authorities said, after going on the run in connection with a brutal 2011 slaying in New Jersey.

Agents apprehended Walter Yovany Gomez without incident in Woodbridge, Virginia, said Tim Gallagher, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark Division.

""Tips all along had generated interest in the Washington, D.C., area and a tip from the general public placed him in northern Virginia,"" Gallagher said.

He added that Gomez is expected to be extradited to Newark and face charges of murder and racketeering.

Gomez was a known member of the MS-13 gang from Honduras and entered the U.S. illegally, the FBI said. His name was added to the ""Most Wanted List"" in April and the bureau had offered a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to his arrest.

The FBI said Gomez is a suspected co-conspirator in the murder of a man who was found in a New Jersey apartment with his throat cut and stabbed 17 times in the back. The victim was suspected of socializing with a rival gang and was allegedly ordered to be killed by MS-13 leaders.

During a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, earlier this month, President Donald Trump praised law enforcement and immigration officials for cracking down on gang members, particularly MS-13.

""We are taking the fight to the drug smugglers, human traffickers and the vile criminal cartels like MS-13 who are being thrown out of our country so quickly you can't even count,"" he said. ""We are liberating American communities from these vicious, violent gangs.""",The FBI said Walter Yovany Gomez is a suspected co-conspirator in the murder of a man who was found brutally murdered in a New Jersey apartment in 2011.

What followed was a tense two weeks of military standoff, with JFK going live on TV to tell Americans that the US is prepared to use military force if necessary to protect the American people from the danger posed by the Soviet Union.

Millions of Americans especially those from the mid-west are ecstatic that they now have a president who is sticking up for their nation and its friends and allies. President Trump made it clear in no uncertain terms that Kim Jong Un will “truly regret it fast” if he utters an overt threat – which Kim and his family have been doing for years – directed against Guam, or any American territory or ally for that matter.

One of Trump’s avid supporters was even quoted as saying that “it’s about time somebody stood up to those who have been pushing us around especially with the kind of firepower we have,” even re-tweeting the US Pacific Command Twitter post that declared, “#USAF B-1B Lancer #bombers on Guam stand ready to fulfill USFK’s #FightTonight mission if called upon to do so.”

The world was given a peek of the kind of military arsenal the US has at its disposal when two B-1B bombers conducted aerial maneuvers with South Korean fighter jets over the Korean Peninsula, displaying their attack capabilities following North Korea’s firing of an ICBM early in July. The US also tested its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in Alaska – successfully detecting, tracking and intercepting a mid-range ballistic missile that was launch-tested over the Pacific Ocean.

In terms of military firepower, there is no doubt the United States has formidable fighting strength – 2,300 fighter aircraft, 2,800 attack planes, over 6,000 choppers (about 1,000 of them attack helicopters), more than 41,000 armored fighting vehicles, 19 aircraft carriers, 70 submarines and over 60 destroyers. Three weeks ago, the US commissioned the USS Gerald Ford – the $13 billion, state-of-the-art warship that Donald Trump said was America’s 100,000-ton strong message to the world that will make enemies shake in fear.

The US military believes that being ahead is the only way for it to maintain the balance of power in the world – thus, it has continued over the years to develop highly sophisticated and technologically advanced military hardware like the F-22 Raptors, F-35 Lightning II, B-2 Spirit bombers, Virginia-class submarines, micro-and stealth drones and hypersonic missiles, to name a few.

A source in the Pentagon told us that US technology is “light years ahead of everyone,” adding that there are other “secret weapons” which will be revealed when “absolutely necessary.” Clearly, President Trump’s warnings are “neither nonsense nor shallow,” our source said.

Undoubtedly, we are facing one of the most volatile times in history – and all nations should stand together against any threat to global stability and security. President Duterte’s meeting with US State Secretary Rex Tillerson was perfect timing when the president assured our American friends by saying, “I am your humble friend in Southeast Asia.”","After telling North Korea that it will be met with “fire, fury and power” the likes of which the world has never seen, US president Donald Trump issued an even stronger warning that the US military is “locked and loaded” should the Asian nation choose to “act unwisely.”

The reality, of course, is white men have dominated America throughout its history. White Americans beat their black and Latino counterparts in terms of wealth, income, and educational attainment. All US presidents but one have been white men, and the current Congress — supposedly the most diverse in history — remains dominated by white and male legislators.

White people in North America live in a social environment that protects and insulates them from race-based stress. This insulated environment of racial protection builds white expectations for racial comfort while at the same time lowering the ability to tolerate racial stress, leading to what I refer to as White Fragility. White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium.

DiAngelo’s paper explained that white Americans have a range of “triggers” that can make them defensive about race, from suggestions that a person’s viewpoint is racialized to the rise of people of color into prominent leadership positions. All the triggers she listed were present in the past year — through the presidency of Barack Obama, President Donald Trump’s racist rhetoric, and Black Lives Matter protests against the dominance of white privilege.

Consider how often throughout the 2016 election people would respond to even the slightest suggestion of racism, whether in media or everyday life, with immediate vitriol, disdain, or dismissal. This, DiAngelo argued, is a defense mechanism to confronting questions about privilege. And it makes it difficult to have a reasonable conversation about race, effectively perpetuating a status quo favorable to white Americans by averting discussions about how to change the existing circumstances.

One of the white participants left the session and went back to her desk, upset at receiving (what appeared to the training team as) sensitive and diplomatic feedback on how some of her statements had impacted several people of color in the room. At break, several other white participants approached us (the trainers) and reported that they had talked to the woman at her desk, and she was very upset that her statements had been challenged. They wanted to alert us to the fact that she literally “might be having a heart-attack.” Upon questioning from us, they clarified that they meant this literally. These co-workers were sincere in their fear that the young woman might actually physically die as a result of the feedback. Of course, when news of the woman’s potentially fatal condition reached the rest of the participant group, all attention was immediately focused back onto her and away from the impact she had had on the people of color.

This illustrates just how defensive people can get in the face of accusations of racism: Not only did the woman who faced the criticisms genuinely feel like she was having a heart attack, but the white people around her believed it was totally possible she was. This is the reality of trying to have a conversation that challenges white privilege in America.

You can apply this concept to what we see this weekend in Charlottesville. Many of the people involved have likely led advantaged lives — just because they’re white men in a society that has historically given them more rights than everyone else.

But they’ve seen their racial security challenged. They saw the first black president with Barack Obama. They see demographic statistics that show white Americans will no longer be the majority in the coming decades. They see all of this talk about Black Lives Matter and the importance of diversity, including through policies like affirmative action. They see recent moves to tear down Confederate monuments in the South. And they themselves may have been accused of racism at some point in their lives, perhaps after they raised concerns about any of these issues.",Here’s why white men are acting like the victims in Charlottesville.

President Donald Trump, speaking in Bedminster, New Jersey, said he condemned “in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”

“It has been going on for a long time in our country – not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America,” he added. He did not mention white nationalists and the alt-right movement in his remarks.

Trump also took to Twitter earlier Saturday afternoon to weigh in on the violent demonstration, which has caused Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to issue a state of emergency.

“We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for,” the President wrote. “There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!”

Vice President Mike Pence echoed Trump’s sentiment on Twitter, quoting the President’s tweet and adding, “I stand with @POTUS against hate & violence.”

“U.S is greatest when we join together & oppose those seeking to divide us,” he continued.

The rally could be the “largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States,” according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Police began to break up crowds shortly before noon after city officials declared the gathering an “unlawful assembly.”

But tensions between those attending the rally and counter-protesters continued throughout the day. At least one person was killed and 19 were injured a speeding car slammed into a throng of counterprotesters, according to a statement released on the City of Charlottesville’s verified Twitter account. The driver was later taken into custody, the city said in a news release. It did not name the person.

Trump’s failure to explicitly mention that white nationalists were behind the protests and violence drew criticism from Republican leaders, including Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the most senior Republican in the Senate.

“We should call evil by its name. My brother didn’t give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home,” Hatch tweeted.

Hatch’s office also responded to a march of torch-bearing white nationalists on Friday night, saying “their tiki torches may be fueled by citronella but their ideas are fueled by hate, & have no place in civil society.”

Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner also criticized Trump for not being specific in his condemnation of Saturday’s violence.

“Mr. President - we must call evil by its name,” Gardner tweeted. “These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.”

First lady Melania Trump joined her husband in condemning the violence, as did the President’s homeland security and counterterrorism aide, Thomas Bossert.

“Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let’s communicate w/o hate in our hearts,” the first lady tweeted Saturday afternoon. “No good comes from violence.”

“The violence and hate in Charlotte (sic) are unacceptable. Protests must not undermine law and order, Bossert wrote on Twitter. He added that he has “confidence in state/local law enforcement.”

White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump chimed in on Sunday morning with a call for unity. “There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis,” she tweeted. “We must all come together as Americans – and be one country UNITED.”

Other Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, all spoke out against the rally.

Ryan wrote on Twitter Saturday that “the views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant.”

“Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry,” he continued. He later added “White supremacy is a scourge. This hate and its terrorism must be confronted and defeated.”

McCain issued a passionate statement Saturday evening in response to the rally and the car attack.

“Our Founders fought a revolution for the idea that all men are created equal,” his statement read. “The heirs of that revolution fought a Civil War to save our nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to that revolutionary proposition. Nothing less is at stake on the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, where a violent attack has taken at least one American life and injured many others in a confrontation between our better angels and our worst demons.”

“White supremacists and neo-Nazis are, by definition, opposed to American patriotism and the ideals that define us as a people and make our nation special,” McCain continued. “As we mourn the tragedy that has occurred in Charlottesville, American patriots of all colors and creeds must come together to defy those who raise the flag of hatred and bigotry.”

McConnell tweeted, “The hate and bigotry witnessed in #Charlottesville does not reflect American values. I wholeheartedly oppose their actions.”

And McDaniel said that hatred and bigotry was “dangerous (and) cowardly.”

“Free speech may give them the right to do this but also empowers us to unite to loudly speak out against it,” she wrote in a follow-up tweet.

Across the aisle, former President Barack Obama quoted Nelson Mandela in reaction to the day’s violence.

“‘No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. … People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love. … For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite,” he wrote in a series of tweets.

Trump’s 2016 rival Hillary Clinton also took to Twitter to condemn the protests.

“My heart is in Charlottesville today, and with everyone made to feel unsafe in their country,” the former secretary of state wrote. In a series of subsequent tweets, Clinton implicitly called out the President for his failure to specifically condemn the white nationalists who organized the event.

“The incitement of hatred that got us here is as real and condemnable as the white supremacists in our streets,” she wrote “Every minute we allow this to persist through tacit encouragement or inaction is a disgrace, & corrosive to our values. Now is the time for leaders to be strong in their words & deliberate in their actions.”

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted directly at the President about his remarks, writing: “Repeat after me, @realDonaldTrump: white supremacy is an affront to American values.”

She also spoke out against the rally, tweeting, “Our nation is defined by the march of progress. Our strength lies in our diversity. We must reject hate.”

Earlier, former President Bill Clinton tweeted, “Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy.”

And former Vice President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter: “No. Not in America. We must be stronger, more determined and more united than ever. Racism and hate have no place here.”

He also responded to Trump’s “many sides” statement with a tweet reading “There is only one side. #charlottesville.”

Former Vice President Al Gore, speaking at the progressive Netroots Nation gathering in Atlanta, said he “was surprised” by the President’s statement.

“The statement appeared to give a kind of moral equivalence to the people who had organized this KKK-Nazi march and the people who said, ‘We’re going to stand against fascism and Nazism and racism, and we don’t want that in our community,’” Gore said.

“Mr. President, for the sake of our country, I would urge you to try again,” Gore said. “I say in all sincerity, Mr. President, I would urge you to give more thought to what it means to have a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi movement marching and creating this kind of hatefulness.”

Sen. Kamala Harris of California called the rally “un-American” in a tweet.

“We must all stand against hatred and bigotry, she wrote. “Our unity is our strength and diversity is our power.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote, “The white nationalist demonstration in #Charlottesville is a reprehensible display of racism and hatred that has no place in our society.”

Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine called “displays of violence and bigotry” by white nationlists in Charlotte “sickening.”

“The fact that people like David Duke cited the President to justify their views is a disturbing reminder that divisive rhetoric has sadly contributed to a climate where individuals who espouse hate feel emboldened,” Kaine wrote in a statement Saturday.

He also penned a extensive response on Facebook to Friday night’s march.

“I’m deeply disturbed that our country has to wake up to headlines of torch-wielding white nationalists promoting bigotry and inciting fear on a college campus in Virginia,” he wrote. “Racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric sow seeds of hatred in our communities. That’s not who we are, that’s not what Virginians stand for, and we have no intention of moving backwards toward the division of the past. People peddling in hate from outside of Charlottesville will never define this vibrant community.”

Admiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations called the events in Charlottesville “shameful” and “unacceptable.”

“The Navy will forever stand against intolerance and hatred” Richardson said in a statement posted on Twitter and Facebook.

“We want our Navy to be the safest possible place – a team as strong and tough as we can be, saving violence only for our enemies.”",

The Unite the Right rally, set to take place in the Emancipation Park and McIntire Park, will see the participation of Neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates, and alt-right activists. The rally has been organized against the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from the Emancipation Park. The crowd of the protesters and counter protesters was expected to swell up to 6,000 according to CNN.

A similar rally by Ku Klux Klan that took place in July saw police officers using tear gas shells on protesters.

""Unite the Right was expected to draw a broad spectrum of far-right extremist groups – from immigration foes to anti-Semitic bigots, neo-Confederates, Proud Boys, Patriot and militia types, outlaw bikers, swastika-wearing neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Ku Klux Klan members – all of whom seem emboldened by the Trump presidency,"" according to the U.S. nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).

The Saturday rally could become ""the largest hate-gathering of its kind in decades in the United States,"" the rights group said.

Police were preparing for the possibility of protestors gathering at the McIntire and Emancipation Parks.

 A helicopter crash that killed the pilot and a passenger later in the afternoon outside Charlottesville also was linked to the rally by State Police, though officials did not elaborate on how the crash was connected.

 The chaos boiled over at what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade: the governor declared a state of emergency, police dressed in riot gear ordered people out and helicopters circled overhead. The group had gathered to protest plans to remove a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and others who arrived to protest the racism.

 Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said several hundred counter-protesters were marching when “suddenly there was just this tire screeching sound.” A silver Dodge Challenger smashed into another car, then backed up, barreling through “a sea of people.”

 The impact hurled people into the air. Those left standing scattered, screaming and running for safety in different directions.

 The driver was later arrested, authorities said.

 The turbulence began Friday night, when the white nationalists carried torches though the university campus in what they billed as a “pro-white” demonstration. It quickly spiraled into violence Saturday morning. Hundreds of people threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. One person was arrested in connection.

 President Donald Trump condemned “in the strongest possible terms” what he called an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” after the clashes. He called for “a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.”

 Trump says he’s spoken with the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, and “we agreed that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now.”

 But some of the white nationalists cited Trump’s victory as validation for their beliefs, and Trump’s critics pointed to the president’s racially tinged rhetoric as exploiting the nation’s festering racial tension.

 The Rev. Jesse Jackson noted that Trump for years publicly questioned President Barack Obama’s citizenship.

 “We are in a very dangerous place right now,” he said.

 Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a “pro-white” rally in Charlottesville. White nationalists and their opponents promoted the event for weeks.

 Oren Segal, who directs the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said multiple white power groups gathered in Charlottesville, including members of neo-Nazi organizations, racist skinhead groups and Ku Klux Klan factions.

 The white nationalist organizations Vanguard America and Identity Evropa; the Southern nationalist League of the South; the National Socialist Movement; the Traditionalist Workers Party; and the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights also were on hand, he said, along with several groups with a smaller presence.

 On the other side, anti-fascist demonstrators also gathered in Charlottesville, but they generally aren’t organized like white nationalist factions, said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

 Many others were just locals caught in the fray.

 Colleen Cook, 26, stood on a curb shouting at the rally attendees to go home.

 Cook, a teacher who attended the University of Virginia, said she sent her son, who is black, out of town for the weekend.

 “This isn’t how he should have to grow up,” she said.

 Cliff Erickson leaned against a fence and took in the scene. He said he thinks removing the statue amounts to erasing history and said the “counter-protesters are crazier than the alt-right.”

 “Both sides are hoping for a confrontation,” he said.

 It’s the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C., voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee.

 In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

 Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and “advocating for white people.”

 “This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,” he said in an interview.

 Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer said he was disgusted that the white nationalists had come to his town and blamed Trump for inflaming racial prejudices.

 “I’m not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you’re seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president,” he said.

 Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city that’s home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.

 The statue’s removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville’s history of race is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. They’re now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.

 For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials. A judge has agreed to temporarily block the city from removing the statue for six months.","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia: A car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally Saturday in a Virginia college town, killing one person, hurting dozens more and ratcheting up tension in an increasingly violent confrontation.

Violent clashes today erupted between white supremacists and counter demonstrators in a rally in the US state of Virginia, prompting the authorities to declare an emergency.

The violence broke out ahead of the 'Unite the Right' rally by white supremacists protesting against the planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee from a park in the college town of Charlottesville, 256 kilometres from Virginia.

Following the clashes, police and security forces were deployed in riot gears.

""It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property,"" said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

""I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours,"" he said in a statement.

Noting that most of the protesters were from out of the state, McAuliffe said the emergency was declared to assist local government in restoring public safety.

In a Facebook post, Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer condemned the demonstration by white nationalists.

""Today, in 2017, we are seeing a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance march down the lawns of the architect of our Bill of Rights,"" he said.

""I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus,"" he added.

US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn the violence and called for unity.

""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America.

Let's come together as one!"" Trump tweeted.

Speaker of the US House of Representatives Paul Ryan described the rally as ""vile bigotry"".

""The views fuelling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant. Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry,"" Ryan said.

He was joined by several lawmakers in condemning the violence.

""There's no place for such hate & violence in our society. Our country needs unity now. The events at #Charlottesville are shameful,"" tweeted Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy.

Senate Minority Leader, Charles Schumer, said the march and rally in Charlottesville goes against everything the American flag stands for.

""Charlottesville hate rallies are in stark contrast to everything our nation represents. We reject white supremacy & bigotry of all forms,"" said Congressman Mike Quigley.

The ""Unite the Right"" rally by white supremacist has attracted leaders and members of the country's largest neo Nazi groups.","Violent clashes today erupted between white supremacists and counter demonstrators in a rally in the US state of Virginia, prompting the authorities to declare an emergency."

City, county and state authorities declared a state of emergency as clashes broke out between those demonstrating against plans to remove a statue honouring Confederate general Robert E Lee from a Charlottesville park and counter-protesters. 



 Mr Trump responded to the outbreak of violence ahead of the ""Unite The Right"" rally through Twitter, saying ""we ALL must be united and condemn that hate stands for"".

His message was posted shortly before it was confirmed that one person had been killed and several others injured when a car drove into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters.

He stopped short of condemning the racism issue involved in the removal of the Civil War General's statue. The message was retweeted by the official Presidential Twitter account.

First Lady Melania Trump, who rarely tweets, also responded to condemn the violence in Virginia in a message on her official Twitter account.

Local media reported that riot police and the National Guard were ready to go in, but state police were already on the scene.

There have been reports of pepper spray being used by protesters on both sides as well as bottles being thrown and physical altercations taking place.

Earlier in the day there was video footage of alleged members of a militia marching through the streets of Charlottesville armed with assault rifles and wearing tactical gear. There have not been any reports of gunshots as yet.

Mr Trump also made a public address several hours after the protests began during a bill signing regarding the Veterans Administration while on his 17-day ""working vacation"" at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"".

He added, ""it's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time,"" presumably referring to the issue of racism.

Mr Trump noted that ""it has no place in America"" and stressed the importance of ""law and order and protection of innocent lives"".

The President also said that he spoke with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and the two ""agreed that the hate and division must stop...right now.""

He said he wants Americans to come together with ""love for our nation...and true affection for each other"".

Mr Trump was known for what many called divisive and hateful rhetoric throughout the 2016 campaign and his first seven months in office.

He ended by saying ""no matter our colour, creed, religion, or political party, we are all Americans first,"" adding that his administration was working to understand the situation in Charlottesville and ""restore the sacred bonds of loyalty between the citizens and this nation"".","Donald Trump has condemned violence that broke out as far-right, white nationalists held a rally in Charlottesville, Virgina.

But as the death toll linked to the rally rose to three - one in the car crash and two in a helicopter crash outside Charlottesville - the president's apparent refusal to criticise far-right hate groups sparked sharp criticism, even from members of his Republican party.

Virginia's governor, Terry McAuliffe, had already declared a state of emergency when a vehicle rammed into a crowd in normally tranquil Charlottesville, an incident in which police reported ""multiple injuries"" and ""several pedestrians struck"".

The person who died when the car surged into the crowd of what witnesses said were counter-demonstrators, was a 32-year-old woman who was crossing the street, Charlottesville police chief Al Thomas said.

The male driver was taken into custody and police were treating the incident as a ""criminal homicide,"" he said.

At least 35 people were treated for injuries, ranging from life-threatening to minor, Thomas said.

Hundreds had descended on the university town either to march in or rail against a ""Unite the Right Rally"". Unrest quickly flared.

""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for,"" Trump tweeted. ""There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Let's come together as one!""

Trump later said: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides."" Trump spoke from Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is on holiday.

""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he said. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation.""

The president stopped short of condemning white nationalist and supremacist groups, and ignored shouted questions from journalists about the groups, which broadly supported Trump in last year's election.

Council on American-Islamic Relations national executive director Nihad Awad said: ""We condemn this apparent act of domestic terrorism targeting anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, and urge all Americans to denounce the racists and Islamophobes brought to that city by the Unite the Right rally.

""Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe today rightly called out the 'white supremacists and the Nazis' - saying 'go home, you are not wanted ... shame on you, you pretend that you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot' - something President Trump failed to do in his weak reaction to the terror attack.

""President Trump's reluctance to both denounce the act of terrorism and to call out the white supremacist and racists groups by name constitutes a failure of moral leadership and sends the wrong message to newly-empowered racist groups nationwide.""

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, a Trump supporter who was in Charlottesville on Saturday, was also unsatisfied with the president.

""So, after decades of White Americans being targeted for discriminated & anti-White hatred, we come together as a people, and you attack us?"" Duke tweeted. ""I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists,"" the Washington Post reported.

Duke, speaking to the crowd, called Saturday’s events ""the first step toward taking America back,"" the Washington Post said.

""The truth is European Americans face tremendous discrimination in this country - jobs, scholarships, promotions,"" Duke said. ""The truth is we are being ethnically cleansed within our own nation.""

Ambulances quickly arrived at the scene of the car crash, which a witness told AFP was ""intentional"" - saying one girl got ""tore up"" after the car ""backed up and they hit again"".

He said the dark car ""raced down here, jumped over the speed bumps and it backed up and it hit everyone again"".

Earlier in the day McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, saying he was ""disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours"".

The previous evening hundreds of torch-bearing marchers demonstrated at the University of Virginia campus.

""It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property,"" McAuliffe wrote in a statement on his emergency declaration.

On Saturday morning, people in combat gear - some wearing bicycle and motorcycle helmets and carrying clubs, sticks and makeshift shields - fought one another on downtown streets, with little apparent police interference. Both sides sprayed chemical irritants and hurled plastic bottles through the air, the Washington Post reported.

A large contingent of Charlottesville police officers and Virginia State Police troopers in riot gear were stationed on side streets and at nearby barricades but did nothing to break up the melee until about 11:40am. Using megaphones, police then declared an unlawful assembly and gave a five-minute warning to leave Emancipation Park.

They were met by equal numbers of counter-protesters, including clergy, Black Lives Matter activists and Princeton professor Cornel West, the Washington Post reported.

An AFP journalist at the scene witnessed demonstrators, some clad in militia uniforms, throwing punches and hurling bottles even before the rally began.

Video footage from the demonstrations showed anti-racism protesters waving flags from the Black Lives Matter movement, as crowds chanted slogans like ""We say no to racist fear"" and ""No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA"".

Others brandished Confederate flags, today considered a symbol of racism by many Americans.

Michael Von Kotch, a Pennsylvania resident who called himself a Nazi, told the Washington Post the rally made him ""proud to be white"".

He said that he’s long held white supremacist views and that Trump’s election has ""emboldened"" him and the members of his own Nazi group, the Post reported.

""We are assembled to defend our history, our heritage and to protect our race to the last man,"" Von Kotch said, wearing a protective helmet and sporting a wooden shield and a broken pool cue. ""We came here to stand up for the white race.""

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler, who had called for the white nationalist demonstration, on Saturday declared it ""a monumental event for our movement"" even after police started clearing the crowd.

Saturday's far-right rally followed a smaller demonstration last month that saw a few dozen Ku Klux Klan-linked marchers gather to protest the city's planned removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who led Confederate forces in the US civil war.

Though they were outnumbered by hundreds of jeering counter-protesters, the extreme right marchers, some donning the traditional white hood of the notorious white power group, saw their images spread worldwide on social media.

This time, the extreme right brought in big names of the alt-right movement, which has been energised, critics say, by Trump's ascent to the White House, in a bid to attract more supporters.

Normally reticent First Lady Melania Trump took to Twitter to respond to the demonstrations, writing: ""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville.""

""Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists,"" Florida Senator Marco Rubio tweeted.

Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Republican senator in US history, tweeted that ""We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home.""

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan also weighed in on the social media platform: ""The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant. Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.""

University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan on Saturday condemned that demonstration, saying in a statement that ""the intimidating and abhorrent behavior displayed by the alt-right protesters was wrong"".

WASHINGTON, D.C. — A car has struck a group of counter-protesters that were dispersing from the clashes at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.

The mayor of the city, Mike Signer, wrote on Twitter that “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here.”

The Charlottesville police said that the victim was killed when the car rammed into the group, and that 19 were injured. The victim was not identified, nor was the driver of the car, who was apprehended.

It took place at Water & 4th Street, in an area where a group of protesters were walking and chanting to counter the white nationalist demonstrations on Saturday.

Virginia State Police said that the crash involved three cars. According to reporters at the scene and a video posted of a livestream, the gray-colored vehicle with Ohio plates struck pedestrians in the crowd and then hit two other cars, which in turn hit others. The vehicle then sped away. The crash took place near Timberlake’s, a historic drug store in the central business district.

Signer wrote on Twitter that he was “furious and heartsick by the car crash that has injured many. Please all – go home to your families. We can work tomorrow. GO HOME! PLEASE!”

Hundreds of white supremacists and white nationalists descended on the city Friday night and Saturday for a rally that had been organized to protest plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general.

Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, and local police cleared the crowd after protesters clashed with counter demonstrators. Through much of Saturday, cable news showed images of clashing demonstrators, throwing plastic bottles, engaged in fistfights and screaming at each other.

The rally was set to take place at noon at Emancipation Park, where the statute is located, but police declared an unlawful assembly as the demonstrators clashed.

The violent day left at least one person dead, dozens injured and this usually quiet college town a bloodied symbol of the nation's roiling racial and political divisions.

The chaos erupted around what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade — including neo-Nazis, skinheads, members of the Ku Klux Klan — who descended on the city to ""take America back"" by rallying against plans to remove a Confederate statue. Hundreds came to protest against the racism. There were street brawls and violent clashes; the governor declared a state of emergency, police in riot gear ordered people out and helicopters circled overhead.

Peaceful protesters were marching downtown, carrying signs that read ""black lives matter"" and ""love."" A silver Dodge Challenger suddenly came barreling through ""a sea of people"" and smashed into another car, said Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student.

The impact hurled people into the air and blew off their shoes. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed as she crossed the street.

""It was a wave of people flying at me,"" said Sam Becker, 24, sitting in the emergency room to be treated for leg and hand injuries.

Those left standing scattered, screaming and running for safety. Video caught the car reversing, hitting more people, its windshield splintered from the collision and bumper dragging on the pavement. Medics carried the injured, bloodied and crying, away as a police tank rolled down the street.

The driver, James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old who recently moved to Ohio from where he grew up in Kentucky, was charged with second-degree murder and other counts. Field's mother, Samantha Bloom, told The Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn't know it was a white supremacist rally.

""I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,"" said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally.

""He had an African-American friend so ...,"" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she'd be surprised if her son's views were that far right.

His arrest capped off hours of unrest. Hundreds of people threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Some came prepared for a fight, with body armor and helmets. Videos that ricocheted around the world on social media showed people beating each other with sticks and shields.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer, both Democrats, lumped the blame squarely on the rancor that has seeped into American politics and the white supremacists who came from out of town into their city, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, home to Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's plantation.

""There is a very sad and regrettable coarseness in our politics that we've all seen too much of today,"" Signer said at a press conference. ""Our opponents have become our enemies, debate has become intimidation.""

Some of the white nationalists at Saturday's rally cited President Donald Trump's victory after a campaign of racially-charged rhetoric as validation for their beliefs.

Trump criticized the violence in a tweet Saturday, followed by a press conference and a call for ""a swift restoration of law and order.""

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,"" he said.

The ""on many sides"" ending of his statement drew the ire of his critics, who said he failed to specifically denounce white supremacy and equated those who came to protest racism with the white supremacists. The Rev. Jesse Jackson noted that Trump for years questioned President Barack Obama's citizenship and his legitimacy as the first black president, and has fanned the flames of white resentment.

""We are in a very dangerous place right now,"" Jackson said. McAuliffe said at Saturday's press conference that he spoke to Trump on the phone, and insisted that the president must work to combat hate.

Trump said he agreed with McAuliffe ""that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now.""

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities will pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash.

The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,"" Sessions wrote. ""When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.""

Oren Segal, who directs the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said multiple white power groups gathered in Charlottesville, including members of neo-Nazi organizations, racist skinheads and KKK factions. The white nationalist organizations Vanguard America and Identity Evropa; the Southern nationalist League of the South; the National Socialist Movement; the Traditionalist Workers Party; and the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights also were on hand, he said.

""We anticipated this event being the largest white supremacist gathering in over a decade,"" Segal said. ""Unfortunately, it appears to have become the most violent as well.""

On the other side, anti-fascist demonstrators also gathered, but they generally aren't organized like white nationalist factions, said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

In addition to Fields, at least three more men were arrested in connection to the protests.

The Virginia State Police announced late Saturday that Troy Dunigan, a 21-year-old from Chattanooga, Tennessee, was charged with disorderly conduct; Jacob L. Smith, a 21-year-old from Louisa, Virginia, was charged with assault and battery; and James M. O'Brien, 44, of Gainesville, Florida, was charged with carrying a concealed handgun.

Just as the city seemed like to be quieting down, black smoke billowed out from the tree tops just outside of town as a Virginia State Police helicopter crashed into the woods.

Robby E. Noll, who lives in the county just outside Charlottesville, heard the helicopter sputtering.

""I turned my head to the sky. You could tell he was struggling to try to get control of it,"" he said.

He said pieces of the helicopter started to break off as it fell from the sky.

Both troopers onboard, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Berke M.M. Bates, one day shy of his 41st birthday, were killed. Police said the helicopter had been deployed to the violent protests in the city, which has been caught in the middle of the nation's culture wars since it decided earlier this year to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, enshrined in bronze on horseback in the city's Emancipation Park.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally. Spencer returned for Saturday's protest, and denied all responsibility for the violence. He blamed the police.

Signer said the white supremacist groups who came into his city to spread hate ""are on the losing side of history.""

""Tomorrow will come and we will emerge,"" he said, ""I can promise you, stronger than ever.""

Four-hundred miles away, the mayor of Lexington, Kentucky, hinted that the white supremacists might get the opposite of what they'd hoped for.

Mayor Jim Gray announced on Twitter that he would work to remove the confederate monument at his county's courthouse.

""Today's events in Virginia remind us that we must bring our country together by condemning violence, white supremacists and Nazi hate groups,"" he wrote. ""We cannot let them define our future.""","

On Friday night, longtime Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, tweeted that hate “has no place in civil society.”

Following clashes Saturday morning, Hatch sent another tweet, saying Americans should call “evil by its name” and that his brother had not given his life fighting Hitler in World War II for ”Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home.”

About 11 a.m. Saturday, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency amid hundreds of people throwing punches and water bottles before the rally even officially started, and police in riot gear ordered protesters — both white nationalists and counterdemonstrators — to disperse, according to a report by The Washington Post.



Photos from the rally showed protesters waving Confederate flags and Nazi symbols.

About two hours after the violent clashes, a car plowed into protesters who were marching through downtown, killing one and injuring more than a dozen others. The driver, later identified as James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, as well as other crimes.

“It‘s hard to explain to my children now that this is happening,” said state Sen. Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City. ”We’re repeating history on so many levels.”

She called the violence ”tragic” and “devastating.” The hatred doesn’t represent the vast majority of Americans, she said, nor did the rise of racism happen overnight.

This is a time to reflect, as a nation, she said, adding that “this is a conversation that needs to happen tonight,” starting with families.

“This nation has been through a lot,” Escamilla said. “To be where we are and to regress would be very unfortunate, and I think most Americans do not believe that‘s the right place we want to be.”



Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, wrote in an email to The Salt Lake Tribune that “these acts do not represent the America that I know.”

“The hatred and bigotry on display in Charlottesville is unacceptable,” he said.

Mormon Women for Ethical Government, a group that has fought against deportations in Utah, called for civil discourse and decried racism ”where its ugly tentacles reach.”

“We stand with the good citizens of Charlottesville, Virginia, who are being singled out because of skin color or religion by gangs of cowardly white supremacists,” spokeswoman Sharlee Mullins Glenn wrote in a statement. ”We believe in the inherent dignity of every human being. Our beloved nation was inspired by the ideal of a government that was not tribal, but based on rule of law, fairness and equal opportunity for all.” 



Gov. Gary Herbert was unavailable for comment, but sent two tweets condemning the violence.

”Pro-white” activists had gathered to protest the city’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park in downtown Charlotte.

Some protesters flew flags for the American Vanguard, a national group associated with two flyers that were posted on the University of Utah campus last week.

The U.’s senior administrators also added their voice to those who condemned Saturday’s events, expressing support for the University of Virginia community in a tweet.

In a tweet, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski called on the community to reject the racist posters and the hatred at the Charlottesville rally.

“We must all come together and turn our backs on hate,” she said.","As tensions escalated during “pro-white” demonstration&nbsp;in Charlottesville, Va., on Friday night into chaos and violence Saturday morning before a planned a white nationalist rally that left&nbsp;one dead and dozens injured, Utah leaders and activists took to Twitter to condemn hatred.&nbsp;"

City, county and state authorities declared a state of emergency as clashes broke out between those demonstrating against plans to remove a statue honouring Confederate general Robert E Lee from a Charlottesville park and counter-protesters. 



 Mr Trump responded to the outbreak of violence ahead of the ""Unite The Right"" rally through Twitter, saying ""we ALL must be united and condemn that hate stands for"".

His message was posted shortly before it was confirmed that one person had been killed and several others injured when a car drove into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters.

He stopped short of condemning the racism issue involved in the removal of the Civil War General's statue. The message was retweeted by the official Presidential Twitter account.

First Lady Melania Trump, who rarely tweets, also responded to condemn the violence in Virginia in a message on her official Twitter account.

Local media reported that riot police and the National Guard were ready to go in, but state police were already on the scene.

There have been reports of pepper spray being used by protesters on both sides as well as bottles being thrown and physical altercations taking place.

Earlier in the day there was video footage of alleged members of a militia marching through the streets of Charlottesville armed with assault rifles and wearing tactical gear. There have not been any reports of gunshots as yet.

Mr Trump also made a public address several hours after the protests began during a bill signing regarding the Veterans Administration while on his 17-day ""working vacation"" at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"".

He added, ""it's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time,"" presumably referring to the issue of racism.

Mr Trump noted that ""it has no place in America"" and stressed the importance of ""law and order and protection of innocent lives"".

The President also said that he spoke with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and the two ""agreed that the hate and division must stop...right now.""

He said he wants Americans to come together with ""love for our nation...and true affection for each other"".

Mr Trump was known for what many called divisive and hateful rhetoric throughout the 2016 campaign and his first seven months in office.

He ended by saying ""no matter our colour, creed, religion, or political party, we are all Americans first,"" adding that his administration was working to understand the situation in Charlottesville and ""restore the sacred bonds of loyalty between the citizens and this nation"".","Donald Trump has condemned violence that broke out as far-right, white nationalists held a rally in Charlottesville, Virgina.

But as the death toll linked to the rally rose to three - one in the car crash and two in a helicopter crash outside Charlottesville - the president's apparent refusal to criticise far-right hate groups sparked sharp criticism, even from members of his Republican party.

Virginia's governor, Terry McAuliffe, had already declared a state of emergency when a vehicle rammed into a crowd in normally tranquil Charlottesville, an incident in which police reported ""multiple injuries"" and ""several pedestrians struck"".

The person who died when the car surged into the crowd of what witnesses said were counter-demonstrators, was a 32-year-old woman who was crossing the street, Charlottesville police chief Al Thomas said.

The male driver was taken into custody and police were treating the incident as a ""criminal homicide,"" he said.

At least 35 people were treated for injuries, ranging from life-threatening to minor, Thomas said.

Hundreds had descended on the university town either to march in or rail against a ""Unite the Right Rally"". Unrest quickly flared.

""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for,"" Trump tweeted. ""There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Let's come together as one!""

Trump later said: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides."" Trump spoke from Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is on holiday.

""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he said. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation.""

The president stopped short of condemning white nationalist and supremacist groups, and ignored shouted questions from journalists about the groups, which broadly supported Trump in last year's election.

Council on American-Islamic Relations national executive director Nihad Awad said: ""We condemn this apparent act of domestic terrorism targeting anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, and urge all Americans to denounce the racists and Islamophobes brought to that city by the Unite the Right rally.

""Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe today rightly called out the 'white supremacists and the Nazis' - saying 'go home, you are not wanted ... shame on you, you pretend that you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot' - something President Trump failed to do in his weak reaction to the terror attack.

""President Trump's reluctance to both denounce the act of terrorism and to call out the white supremacist and racists groups by name constitutes a failure of moral leadership and sends the wrong message to newly-empowered racist groups nationwide.""

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, a Trump supporter who was in Charlottesville on Saturday, was also unsatisfied with the president.

""So, after decades of White Americans being targeted for discriminated & anti-White hatred, we come together as a people, and you attack us?"" Duke tweeted. ""I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists,"" the Washington Post reported.

Duke, speaking to the crowd, called Saturday’s events ""the first step toward taking America back,"" the Washington Post said.

""The truth is European Americans face tremendous discrimination in this country - jobs, scholarships, promotions,"" Duke said. ""The truth is we are being ethnically cleansed within our own nation.""

Ambulances quickly arrived at the scene of the car crash, which a witness told AFP was ""intentional"" - saying one girl got ""tore up"" after the car ""backed up and they hit again"".

He said the dark car ""raced down here, jumped over the speed bumps and it backed up and it hit everyone again"".

Earlier in the day McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, saying he was ""disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours"".

The previous evening hundreds of torch-bearing marchers demonstrated at the University of Virginia campus.

""It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property,"" McAuliffe wrote in a statement on his emergency declaration.

On Saturday morning, people in combat gear - some wearing bicycle and motorcycle helmets and carrying clubs, sticks and makeshift shields - fought one another on downtown streets, with little apparent police interference. Both sides sprayed chemical irritants and hurled plastic bottles through the air, the Washington Post reported.

A large contingent of Charlottesville police officers and Virginia State Police troopers in riot gear were stationed on side streets and at nearby barricades but did nothing to break up the melee until about 11:40am. Using megaphones, police then declared an unlawful assembly and gave a five-minute warning to leave Emancipation Park.

They were met by equal numbers of counter-protesters, including clergy, Black Lives Matter activists and Princeton professor Cornel West, the Washington Post reported.

An AFP journalist at the scene witnessed demonstrators, some clad in militia uniforms, throwing punches and hurling bottles even before the rally began.

Video footage from the demonstrations showed anti-racism protesters waving flags from the Black Lives Matter movement, as crowds chanted slogans like ""We say no to racist fear"" and ""No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA"".

Others brandished Confederate flags, today considered a symbol of racism by many Americans.

Michael Von Kotch, a Pennsylvania resident who called himself a Nazi, told the Washington Post the rally made him ""proud to be white"".

He said that he’s long held white supremacist views and that Trump’s election has ""emboldened"" him and the members of his own Nazi group, the Post reported.

""We are assembled to defend our history, our heritage and to protect our race to the last man,"" Von Kotch said, wearing a protective helmet and sporting a wooden shield and a broken pool cue. ""We came here to stand up for the white race.""

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler, who had called for the white nationalist demonstration, on Saturday declared it ""a monumental event for our movement"" even after police started clearing the crowd.

Saturday's far-right rally followed a smaller demonstration last month that saw a few dozen Ku Klux Klan-linked marchers gather to protest the city's planned removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who led Confederate forces in the US civil war.

Though they were outnumbered by hundreds of jeering counter-protesters, the extreme right marchers, some donning the traditional white hood of the notorious white power group, saw their images spread worldwide on social media.

This time, the extreme right brought in big names of the alt-right movement, which has been energised, critics say, by Trump's ascent to the White House, in a bid to attract more supporters.

Normally reticent First Lady Melania Trump took to Twitter to respond to the demonstrations, writing: ""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville.""

""Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists,"" Florida Senator Marco Rubio tweeted.

Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Republican senator in US history, tweeted that ""We should call evil by its name. My brother didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home.""

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan also weighed in on the social media platform: ""The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant. Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.""

University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan on Saturday condemned that demonstration, saying in a statement that ""the intimidating and abhorrent behavior displayed by the alt-right protesters was wrong"".

A helicopter crash that killed the pilot and a passenger later in the afternoon outside the university town also was linked to the rally by State Police, though officials did not elaborate on how the crash was connected.

At a late afternoon news conference, Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said that 35 people had been injured in various confrontations during the rally and made a point of saying that none of those involved his officers. Thomas also said that the car crash was being treated as an act of ""criminal homicide.""

The chaos boiled over at what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade: the governor declared a state of emergency, police dressed in riot gear ordered people out and helicopters circled overhead. The group had gathered to protest plans to remove a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.



Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, told the Associated Press several hundred counter-protesters were marching when ""suddenly there was just this tire screeching sound."" A silver Dodge Challenger smashed into another car, then backed up, barreling through ""a sea of people.""

The impact hurled people into the air. Those left standing scattered, screaming and running for safety in different directions.

Virginia Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran told The Associated Press that the driver of the car, a man, was in custody. Moran did not provide the driver's name.

The crash occurred approximately two hours after clashes in which hundreds of people scramed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other ahead of the scheduled noon demonstration.

Adressing those who he called ""the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesvillle today,"" Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe told them to ""go home.""

""There is no place for you here,"" McAuliffe said. ""There is no place for you in America ... Go home and never come back.""

Hours earlier, President Donald Trump condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" what he called an ""egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides"" after the clashes. He called for ""a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.""

Hours later, Trump tweeted condolences to the families of the victims of the helicopter crash — who he identified as Virginia state troopers — and the unidentified woman who was killed by the car.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had planned what he called a ""pro-white"" rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park.

Oren Segal, who directs the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said multiple white power groups had gathered in Charlottesville, including members of neo-Nazi organizations, racist skinhead groups and Ku Klux Klan factions.



""We anticipated this event being the largest white supremacist gathering in over a decade,"" Segal said. ""Unfortunately, it appears to have become the most violent as well.""



The white nationalist organizations Vanguard America and Identity Evropa; the Southern nationalist League of the South; the National Socialist Movement; the Traditionalist Workers Party; and the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights also were on hand, he said, along with several groups with a smaller presence.



Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and ""advocating for white people.""

""This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,"" he said in an interview.

The violence was met with universal condemnation from political leaders, as well as first lady Melania Trump, who tweeted: ""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville.""

Vice President Mike Pence tweeted: ""I stand with @POTUS against hate & violence. U.S. is greatest when we join together & oppose those seeking to divide us. #Charlottesville""

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also tweeted condemning the protests. ""The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant,"" Ryan tweeted. ""Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.""

The NHL’s Detroit Red Wings released a statement Saturday denouncing the user of their logo at the rally and that they are considering legal action to stop it.

The team said it “vehemently” disagrees with and is not associated with the event.”

A Michigan-based white nationalist group called the Detroit Right Wings uses the Red Wings’ logo.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer said he was disappointed that the white nationalists had come to his town and blamed Trump for inflaming racial prejudices during his campaign last year.

""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.""

Saturday's violence was the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city voted earlier this year to remove the Lee statue.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named after Confederate General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. They are now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.

A group called the Monument Fund filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials. A judge has agreed to a temporary injunction that blocks the city from removing the statue for six months.

Horrifying footage shows the Dodge Challenger knocking bodies into the air while accelerating through the placard-waving crowd as onlookers scream in terror.

A 20-year-old suspect, James Alex Fields, from Ohio, has been arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failing to stop for an accident involving a death.

Around 16 others were also hurt in other violent clashes during the demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia.

A woman who has identified herself as as the mother of suspect James Alex Fields has revealed she was cat sitting for him when he left for the rally.

In the clip, the stunned mum says she had no idea what her son was going to do: ""I just knew he was going to a rally... I try to stay out of his political views. I don't really get too involved.""

""I don't really understand what the rally was about or anything,"" she added. ""I didn't know it was white supremacists.""

Meanwhile, a police helicopter also crashed seven miles southwest of Charlottesville, killing two, during the protests, although it is not clear if the crash is related to the violence.

Virginia State Police identified the fallen troopers as Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates.

The disturbing video shows the Dodge ramming into the back of a Toyota resulting in a woman being thrown on top of the Japanese-made vehicle while others lie crumpled on the street screaming in pain.

Another video has emerged showing the rogue car accelerating towards the crowd before smashing into the demonstrators and the white Toyota.

""Charlottesville Police and Virginia State Police are on the scene of a three vehicle accident"" said authorities in a statement. ""Multiple injuries are reported.""

A witness said a dozen people had been hurt in the collision - which he called ""intentional"" - saying one girl got ""tore up"" after the car ""backed up and they hit again.""

He said the dark car ""raced down here, jumped over the speed bumps and it backed up and it hit everyone again.""

""There was a girl that was on the ground; she was trying to get up,"" he added.

President Donald Trump has spoken following the deadly car attack condemning the violence ""on many sides.""

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,"" Trump said from Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is on a working vacation.

""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he said. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation.""

The president later tweeted: ""Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!""

Terry McAuliffe, the Governor of Virginia said: ""I have a message to all the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today... go home.""

""There is no place for you here. There is no place for you in America,"" he said.

White supremacists armed with rifles, shields and helmets clashed with counter protesters at the Unite the Right rally today despite a state of emergency being declared after the first violent clashes last night, when the far-right demonstrators marched on the University of Virginia wielding wooden torches.

Organisers of the Unite the Right rally claim that white people in America are being persecuted and that white history is being erased from the American identity.

They could be heard chanting racist slogans including one belonging to the Nazis using the words ""blood and soil"".

Marchers were met by counter-protesters at the statue of Thomas Jefferson - the university's founder and third president of the United States.

Footage from the scene saw marchers beating people with their wooden torches.

The Unite the Right rally is expected to draw some 6,000 people and as many counter protesters.

President Trump earlier slammed the rally on Twitter insisting the country must ""come together as one.""

He tweeted: ""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

Last night counter-white supremacist protesters took to the streets of Oakland in response to the deadly violence that erupted at the rally in Charlottesville.

Protests blocked both directions of the Interstate 580 freeway as they chanted anti-racism slogans.

Wielding flags and megaphones they decried the killing in Charlottesville and the ideology of the alt-right .

Virginia's national guard have been put on alert by state authorities should they need to help police keep the peace.

The rally in Charlottesville is taking place in Emancipation Park, the new name given to it by city councillors.

The name change from Lee Park was voted in earlier this year in an attempt to tackle the tainted history of the Confederacy who fought to keep slavery in the US civil war.

The park was named after famed general Robert E. Lee whose statue remains standing in the park.

A legal challenge to its removal, supported by far-right activists, has meant a judge will decide on its future.

A decision is expected at the end of the month.

One of those killed, a 32-year-old woman, died after a car ploughed into counter protesters as she was crossing the street.

The Telegraph saw injured people lying in the road moments after the silver saloon car sped into the crowd.

Col. Martin Kumer, the superintendent of the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, confirmed that an Ohio man, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, had been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at the scene of an accident that resulted in a death.

However the authorities declined to say publicly that Mr. Fields was the driver of the car the plowed into the crowd

The death toll is understood to include two Virginia State Police officers who were killed when their helicopter crashed near Charlottesville.

They were later named as Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper Berke M.M. Bates, who would have turned 41 on Sunday.

Police said 19 people were injured in the car ramming incident and 15 in other violent incidents.

The Department of Justice and FBI have opened a civil rights investigation. In addition to Mr Fields, three other people have been arrested.

The arrests followed a day in which the quiet university town erupted in violence with armed neo-Nazis and white supremacists fighting police and counter-protestors.

Riot police used tear gas and armoured vehicles during what was described by civil rights groups as America's ""largest hate gathering in decades"".

The city's mayor Mike Signer said: ""I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will - go home.

""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.""

A state of emergency was declared and hundreds of far-right protesters left the city's Emancipation Park as police used megaphones to declare their gathering an ""unlawful assembly"".

Right wing blogger Jason Kessler, who organised the event, and Richard Spencer, a prominent ""alt-right"" activist who was due to speak, were evacuated with security and encouraged followers to leave peacefully.

The extremists had descended on the quiet southern city of 47,000 people for a “Unite the Right” rally but the situation quickly turned violent when they were confronted by activists from the anti-fascist movement known as Antifa.

President Donald Trump denounced the violence, saying on Twitter: ""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

Speaking to reporters at his New Jersey golf course, Mr Trump condemned ""this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides"" which he called ""very, very sad"".

He said: ""It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.

""We want to get the situation straightened out in Charlottesville and we want to study it, and we want to see what we're doing wrong as a country where things like this can happen.""

He added: ""We have to respect each other. Ideally, we have to love each other. We have to heal the wounds of our country.""

Mr Trump declined to answer shouted questions about white nationalists who had supported him.

Far-right activists wore Nazi symbols and shouted “blood and soil” - a slogan of the Third Reich - as they marched into the city while others carried flags of the Confederacy or imitation viking shields. Other militia members carried assault rifles and wore military-style body armour.

The white supremacists exchanged blows with Left-wing demonstrators and in several cases people were hit with pepper spray. Police in riot gear were unable to calm the situation as the two sides fought in the streets.

Early in the afternoon a car ploughed into anti-fascist counter-protesters marching downtown at the junction of 4th and Water Streets.

Arriving on the scene shortly afterwards, The Sunday Telegraph saw several people lying in the street injured, including a woman with a bloody head wound, and others screaming or running away. At least five were later placed in ambulances on stretchers, and others were treated for minor injuries.

Video taken by a demonstrator showed the silver sedan speeding into and hitting two other cars that were waiting for a the march to pass.

Those cars were shunted into the crowd, and the driver of the speeding vehicle then quickly reversed away and fled.

Witness Hunter Harman, 20, told The Telegraph: ""I saw the car. We were marching and I heard a bang. Then I saw people flying though the air, then a bunch of injured people on the ground. I tried to help them.

""He was going so fast, it was 100 per cent deliberate. He banged into the back of two other cars and moved them forward. They accidentally hit people too. Then I didn't see him reverse out.""

Another witness said: ""It was a grey Ford Challenger, it came speeding down the road where there were lots of people. One person got pinched between the Challenger and an armoured car and others got hit. It must have hit a few dozen people. There were people hurt. Then he reversed out at 40mph.""

The Unite the Right rally was organised in protest at plans to remove a statue of Robert E Lee, a Confederate general during the Civil War.

Many southern states have begun removing such statues, saying that leaders who fought for slavery should not be revered in the 21st Century. The demonstrators accuse local governments of trying to erase history by removing the statues and often chant ""You will not replace us” as they rally around the statues.

The city of Charlottesville had tried to get the protest moved to another park but the rally organisers sued and a judge ruled they must be allowed in Emancipation Park, where the Lee statue is.

Shortly after 11am, an hour before the formal rally was due to begin, local authorities declared the state of emergency, saying there was an “imminent threat of civil disturbance, unrest, potential injury to persons, and destruction of property”.

Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, said: ""The acts and rhetoric in Charlottesville over past 24 hours are unacceptable and must stop. A right to speech is not a right to violence.""

He added: “Go home, you are not wanted in this great commonwealth,” he said. “You pretend to be patriots, you are anything but patriots.

“You came here to hurt people and they did hurt people. My message is clear, we are stronger than you.

“There is no place for you here, there is no place for you in America.”

In a statement before her husband condemned the violence First Lady Melania Trump said: ""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate without hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence.”

But David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, hailed the rally as a sign of Mr Trump’s success. “This represents a turning point for the people of this country.

""We are determined to take our country back. We’re going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump.”

As violence continued in Charlottesville there were ugly scenes in a car park as protesters confronted a white nationalist marcher.

In an extended stand-off the marcher shouted: ""This is my country."" A dozen nationalists in military fatigues, some heavily armed with AR -15s and carrying a confederate flag, stood nearby as protesters held signs saying ""Nazis go home"" and yelled at them to ""put down the guns.""

At Emancipation Park a counter-protester with a bloody face said he had been attacked by a far-right demonstrator.

Caleb, 20, who asked not to give his second name, told the Telegraph: ""I was trying to deny them entry to the park and the gentleman decided to hit me in the face with his flagpole.""

Some Republican politicians took to the airwaves to distance themselves from the white supremacists.

Nikki Haley, the US ambassador also condemned the violence.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said: ""The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant. Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.""

Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate last year added: "" We will not step backward. If this is not who we are as Americans, let's prove it.""

Religious leaders of many faiths gathered at the edge of the extremist rally to sing spiritual songs and call for unity.

The chaos on Saturday followed a smaller rally on Friday night, which saw hundreds of mainly white men carrying burning torches marching through the grounds of the University of Virginia.","At least three people have been killed and dozens injured after violence erupted at a far right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will—go home.”

Updated Saturday, Aug. 12, 2017, 2:25 p.m. EDT: The chaos continues. The Associated Press is reporting that a vehicle has plowed into a group of peacefully marching counterprotesters at the “Unite the Right” march in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday afternoon.

An AP reporter saw “at least one person on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately afterward the incident, which occurred approximately two hours after violent clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters.”

A CBS reporter on the scene reports at least six people are on the ground, and response personnel are moving the injured on stretchers.

There were several hundred protesters marching in a long line when the car drove into a group of them, according to the AP report.

“A car appeared to deliberately mow down pedestrians,” says an eyewitness.

The injuries range from minor to life-threatening, authorities said.

Just before noon on Saturday, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency as Unite the Right demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va., overwhelmed local police and left many bloodied. According to reports, two people have been treated for serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Although ABC News reports that McAuliffe ordered the National Guard on standby yesterday, it now looks as if the governor responded with too little, too late.

Those on the scene report chaos, with white racists and counterprotesters clashing. And USA Today cites “reports of urine being tossed at reporters,” so shit has officially gone off the rails.

As noted by many, the police and state of Virginia should have been ready for this fuck shit even since last night, when there were reports of violence during a vigil march of intimidation on the University of Virginia’s campus.

But no, why would there be any coordinated police response to thousands of angry white men—many of them armed—coming to town?

Nope, they save the heavy guns for people who look like this.

Oh, and our feckless leader also tweeted some meaningless platitudes about “hate” after 1 p.m. on Saturday. Ain’t that the pot ...

“No matter your colour or religious calling, we are Americans first,” Trump said.

“Citizens must restore bond of loyalty to one another,” the president said.

Quoting the mayor, AFP reports that one person is dead amid violence between US far-right protesters and counter-demonstrators.

A picturesque Virginia city erupted in violence Saturday as white nationalist demonstrators and counter-protesters clashed, with a car plowing into a group of people and President Donald Trump urging Americans to “condemn all that hate stands for.”

The state’s governor had already declared a state of emergency when a vehicle rammed into a crowd in normally tranquil Charlottesville, an incident in which police reported “multiple injuries” and “several pedestrians struck.”

Hundreds had descended on the university city either to march in or rail against a “Unite the Right Rally.” Unrest quickly flared.

“We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for,” Trump tweeted. “There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Let’s come together as one!”

Ambulances quickly arrived at the scene of the car crash, which a witness told AFP was “intentional” — saying one girl got “tore up” after the car “backed up and they hit again.”

He said the dark sedan “raced down here, jumped over the speed bumps and it backed up and it hit everyone again.”

“There was a girl that was on the ground; she was trying to get up,” he added.

Earlier in the day Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, saying he was “disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours.”

The previous evening hundreds of torch-bearing marchers demonstrated at the University of Virginia campus.

“It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property,” McAuliffe wrote in a statement on his emergency declaration.

Before the collision police began clearing the city’s Emancipation Park after declaring those gathered there to be part of an “unlawful assembly.”

By midday local authorities had reported one arrest and said emergency personnel had responded to eight injuries.

An AFP journalist at the scene witnessed demonstrators, some clad in militia uniforms, throwing punches and hurling bottles even before the official 12 pm EST (1600 GMT) rally start time.

State police also tweeted that some crowd members were using pepper spray, and local media footage showed images of riot police, national guard members and an armored vehicle in the city’s downtown.

Video footage from the demonstrations showed anti-racism protesters waving flags from the Black Lives Matter movement, as crowds chanted slogans like “We say no to racist fear” and “No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Others brandished Confederate flags, today considered a symbol of racism by many Americans.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler, who had called for the white nationalist demonstration, on Saturday declared it “a monumental event for our movement” even after police started clearing the crowd.

Saturday’s far-right rally follows a much smaller demonstration last month that saw a few dozen Ku Klux Klan-linked marchers gather to protest the city’s planned removal of a statue of General Robert E. Lee, who led Confederate forces in the US Civil War.

Though they were outnumbered by hundreds of jeering counter-protesters, the extreme right marchers — some donning the traditional white hood of the notorious white power group — saw their images spread worldwide on social media.

This time, the extreme right brought in big names of the “alt-right” movement — which has been emboldened, critics say, by Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House — in a bid to attract more supporters.

Normally reticent First Lady Melania Trump took to Twitter to respond to the demonstrations, writing, “Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let’s communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. #Charlottesville.”

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan also weighed in on the social media platform: “The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant. Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.”

Friday night’s pre-demonstration also turned into a brawl after torch-bearers linked to the white supremacist far right were met by counter-protesters.

University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan on Saturday condemned that demonstration, saying in a statement that “the intimidating and abhorrent behavior displayed by the alt-right protesters was wrong.”

One protester was arrested and charged with assault and disorderly conduct, she said.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremist groups, said that Saturday’s “Unite the Right Rally” could mark one of the most significant demonstrations of its kind in decades.","President Donald Trump has condemned the violent attack that engulfed the American State of Virginia.

Distraught witnesses described how the vehicle struck several 'peaceful' protesters amid the violence.

The US city of Charlottesville, Virginia witnessed horrific scenes on Saturday when a car ploughed into anti-Nazi demonstrators after an organised white supremacist rally descended into a mass brawl.

Distraught witnesses described how the vehicle struck several 'peaceful' protesters amid the violence.

There are unverified claims at least one demonstrator died while multiple people, possibly including children, are thought to have been injured.

The incident came after a fight broke out between thousands of white marchers and counter-protesters this morning ahead of the ""Unite the Right"" rally.

Dramatic footage showed attendees - some, carrying Confederate flags - running towards each other and throwing punches as the two sides clashed.

Water bottles were reportedly hurled from both sides, while men dressed in military-style uniforms were seen carrying rifles and shields in the area.

Other footage showed chemical sprays and smoke bombs being used.

It was around a couple of hours later that the car was filmed ploughing into protesters in the city, leaving blood splattered across the ground.

A video, circulated on social media , captured the vehicle speeding down the street, straight towards the demonstrators, before crashing into them.

The exact circumstances surrounding the collision remain unclear, although some witnesses claimed the smash appeared ""deliberate"".

Officials had earlier declared a state of emergency after the violence unfolded at the rally, which was expected to be attended by thousands of white nationalists.

The event, which was due to start at midday local time, was organised in protest over the city's decision to remove a Confederate statue from a local park.

However, riot police were forced to intervene after the clashes erupted, with helmet-clad officers spotted confronting demonstrators at the scene.

Shortly before noon (5pm UK time), Charlottesville police declared that the gathering was an unlawful assembly, and ordered that the demonstrators disburse.

Two people were injured in the clashes between the white nationalists, white supremacists and the alt-right and other protesters.

Their wounds were described by police as ""serious but not life-threatening.""

At around 12.30pm, Virginia State Police tweeted: ""VSP troopers gradually moving protesters safely down Market St. in Charlottesville.""

The force had earlier posted a picture of a man being detained by officers.

It had captioned the image: ""Arrests are being made following declaration of unlawful assembly at Emancipation Park in Charlottesville.""

There are reports that white nationalist Richard Spencer has been arrested by officers, but these are currently unconfirmed.

According to Sky News, demonstrators on both sides were filmed using handmade shields as they punched and kicked each other during the brawl.

At one point, a fight appeared to break out when anti-Nazi protesters approached the opposing side ""with what looked like a wooden banner"".

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), Kessler is a relative newcomer to white nationalism–having at one time been supportive of former President Barack Obama and the Occupy Wall Street movement.

A failed author of two novels, Kessler now traffics in standard issue white supremacist phantasms of “white genocide” and “[white] demographic displacement” as well as general complaints about liberalism, black people, Islam and Judaism.

Before organizing the #UniteTheRight rally, he founded Unity and Security for America, which the SPLC describes as, “a nativist, white nationalist group.”

That rally, which occurred last night on the University of Virginia in Charlottesville campus, was marked by Nazi sloganeering, racial slurs and eventually violence against students and journalists.

LawNewz attempted to contact Representative Garrett for reaction to the Kessler photograph and rally. Repeat phone calls to Garrett’s offices in Virginia and Washington, D.C. were not returned. This post will be updated to reflect the congressman’s response–if and when that occurs.

Messages left with the entirety of Virginia’s GOP delegation and the Republican Party of Virginia for comment on Garrett’s association with Kessler were also not returned at the time of publication.

In a story from earlier this year, Garrett’s spokesman Andrew Griffin explained that the congressman posed with Kessler and other members of Unity and Security for America David W. Caron and Isaac Smith because they asked him to.

In a Twitter post, the Charlottesville chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America pointed out that Garrett is not the only Virginia Republican with ties to Kessler. Corey Stewart—who came within a few thousand votes of winning the GOP nomination for this year’s gubernatorial race–met with Kessler at a press conference in June.

Congressman Garrett appeared on Fox News with Eric Shawn on Sunday, August 13 to issue a denunciation of Kessler and his message.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) responded to Trump’s tweet by chiding the president for not directly condemning the so-called alt-right for what’s happening in Charlottesville.

Earlier in the day, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke said Trump was the inspiration behind rallies like Unite the Right.

The president’s remarks were preceded by condemnation from First Lady Melania Trump.

Alt-right leader Richard Spencer, who was rumored to have been arrested at the rally, responded to the first lady by blaming the violence on left-wing extremists and government officials.

Vice President Mike Pence later joined Trump in condemning the violence but similarly declined to directly condemn the alt-right.

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, on the other hand, did condemn the “vile bigotry” and directly referenced the “views fueling the spectacle” in Charlottesville.

Several prominent Democrats, including Bill Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, all strongly rebuked the violence, as well.

Meanwhile, Politico reported that Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer is blaming Trump for the racial unrest unfolding in his city, citing the president’s divisive campaign rhetoric as fueling white supremacist sentiment across the country.

“I’m not going to make any bones about it,” Signer said. “I place the blame for a lot of what you’re seeing in America today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.”","Several hours after a planned white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, descended into chaos and violence, President Donald Trump finally weighed in on Twitter, urging the nation to “come together as one.”

The protesters, consisting of white supremacists, white nationalists, and leaders of the alt-right movement, opposed the removal of a Confederate General Robert E. Lee statue. They have been ordered to leave the site of the protest, Emancipation Park, amid violent encounters with the counter protesters who outnumbered them. According to video footage shared by several reporters on the scene, tear gas and pepper spray have been used to control the crowds, and physical fights have broken out throughout the morning.

While the protest wasn’t scheduled to begin until noon, the scene grew more violent in the hours leading up to the declarations of emergency, with protesters chanting “You will not replace us,” as a group of white supremacists had done the night before during a protest on the University of Virginia campus. According to the New York Times, counter protesters shouted at the crowd from across metal barricades that surrounded the park.

Before 11am local time, state police lined the park in riot gear and warned protesters that they were engaging in an “unlawful assembly” and would be arrested if they did not leave the park. According to the Washington Post‘s Joe Heim, the protesters have marched and evacuated to McIntyre Park. Some have been seen being taken away in vans. Despite this, alt-right leader Richard Spencer has told Heim that the rally isn’t being continued at an alternate location.

Jason Kessler, the organizer of the “Unite the Right” protest, has told reporters that he plans on suing the city. Speaking on Periscope, Kessler said prior to the event’s dispersal that the rally’s speakers, including Spencer, weren’t allowed to enter the speaking area to start the rally. Kessler also alleged that police weren’t stopping counter protesters from blocking the entrance to Emancipation Park.

While House Speaker Paul Ryan and First Lady Melania Trump have tweeted their condemnation of the “United the Right” protest, President Donald Trump tweeted his denouncement more than an hour after the states of emergency were declared. While Trump’s tweet said we must “condemn all that hate stands for,” he did not directly acknowledge the protest in Charlottesville.

Trump’s lack of specificity has left his tweet open to interpretation. Richard Spencer interpreted Trump’s remarks as a potential denouncement of Antifa, the extremist far-left protest group.

Trump did offer a follow-up tweet, declaring the events of the day in Charlottesville “sad!”",The protest ended before it was scheduled to begin.

PREVIOUS STORY: One person is dead and 19 others are injured in Charlottesville, Virginia, after a white nationalist rally and counterprotest turned violent and were called off by police and a car plowed into a crowd of demonstrators marching down a street, causing injuries.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer tweeted Saturday afternoon ET that ""a life has been lost.""

I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will--go home.

Video taken earlier in the afternoon showed crowds walking down a street as several cars move slowly along the same avenue. Abruptly, a silver or gray vehicle rams into the back of another vehicle, slamming one or more cars ahead of it amid the crowd of protesters.

The driver backs up and rapidly flees the scene, videos show.

It's unclear at this time whether or not the driver of the vehicle acted intentionally.

The day began with a gathering for an Unite the Right rally backed by white nationalist groups that was supposed to begin at noon. Clashes between white nationalists and counterprotesters just before the rally started led to a declaration of emergency in the city and to police ordering the crowds to disperse.

Charlottesville has become a flash point for both white nationalists and protesters seeking to counter them following a City Council vote in February to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park formerly called Lee Park.

The park was renamed Emancipation Park in June.

President Trump joined a chorus of figures from across the political spectrum today to speak out against the white nationalist rally that took place, saying, ""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""","One person is dead in Charlottesville, Virginia, after a white nationalist rally and counterprotest turned violent and were called off by police and a car plowed into a crowd of demonstrators marching down a street, causing injuries."

""White lives matter."" ""Jews will not replace us."" Hundreds of torch-wielding American white nationalists and white supremacists, most of whom were young men, roared these words in unison last night at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, a Washington Post report said.

See for yourself.

That happened after a right-wing blogger, Jason Kessler, called for what he termed a ""pro-white"" rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee from a downtown park.

Things got worse this morning. Virginia's governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency after violent clashes took place between white nationalists and counter-protestors.

This Twitter user posted a horrifying video of a vehicle zooming towards people who he said were anti-racist protestors.

Both US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tweeted appeals for calm.

It's the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C., voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and ""advocating for white people.""

""This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,"" he said in an interview.

Between rally attendees and counter-protesters, authorities were expecting as many as 6,000 people, Charlottesville police said this week.

Among those expected to attend are Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and ""alt-right"" activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.

Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which track extremist groups, said the event has the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.

Officials have been preparing for the rally for months. Virginia State Police will be assisting local authorities, and a spokesman said the Virginia National Guard ""will closely monitor the situation and will be able to rapidly respond and provide additional assistance if needed.""

According to initial reports, one person has been declared dead, and 19 injured after a car ploughed into a group of protestors.

Michael Signer said he was disappointed the white nationalists had descended on his town and said responsibility lay with Mr Trump for inflaming racial prejudice during his presidential campaign last year.

Mr Signer said: ""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in America today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the President.""

He was speaking shortly before it emerged one person had been killed and several others injured when a car hit anti-fascist protesters.

The clashes broke out at a ""Unite the Right"" protest over the decision by the local government to remove a statue of the leading Confederate general, Robert E Lee, during the American Civil War.

Mr Trump has now issued his first tweet condemning the violence, several hours after the violence began.

He followed this up with another, calling the clashes which were centered around the city's university, ""sad"".

Some on Twitter accused the President of not being specific enough in his tweet as he did not specify that he was referring to white supremacists or far-right groups.

Several members of the Klu Klux Klan joined in with the protests as well as various alt-right activists, militia members and Confederate heritage groups.

Mr Trump has repeatedly been accused of having stirred up racial tensions in the country through his rhetoric on immigrants and his vow to build a wall between the US and Mexico.

Officials in Charlottesville declared a state of emergency shortly after 11am local time as the clashes became more violent, with punches thrown between rival groups and pepper spray released in the crowd.

The clashes are the latest since the city, situated around 100 miles from Washington DC, voted to remove the statue from a park.

So-called alt-right journalist Jason Kessler said the protest was partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also involved wider issues around free speech and ""advocating for white people"".

He said in an interview: ""This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do.""

More attendees are expected to flock to Charlottesville - normally a quiet, liberal-leaning university city.

Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on standby.

The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which track extremist groups, both believe the event has the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.","Donald Trump has been blamed for the violent clashes between white supremacists and anti-fascist groups in Charlottesville by the mayor of the Virginia town.

It doesn’t focus on attributing individual weather events to climate change or projecting future trends, though other studies have found that some recent extreme events like rainstorms, droughts and heat waves are consistent with the effects of climate change.

The pronounced El Niño pattern that existed from 2015 to early 2016 — the warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean — made the planet warmer than it otherwise would have been, and contributed to some of 2016’s record warmth and regional weather anomalies.

It demonstrates that there is year-to-year variability on top of the decades-long warming trend. Last year’s global mean temperature clearly surpassed other years with similarly strong El Niño patterns, such as 1997 and 1982.

That warming does not happen in equal measure across the planet. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as areas closer to the equator.

It’s not just getting warmer — the symptoms and effects of climate change go far beyond air temperature over land surfaces.

The combination of glaciers melting and thermal expansion of the ocean caused the global mean sea level to climb for the sixth straight year.

Sea level doesn’t rise evenly every year or in every part of the coastline for several reasons, including the behavior of ocean currents.

In the case of Virginia and North Carolina, the coast is naturally subsiding faster than it does elsewhere on the East Coast, which exacerbates the effect of a global sea level rise.

Also at a record high was the temperature of the sea surface. It is now warming at a faster rate than it did during the 20th century, which reflects the fact that most of the heat added to the planet is absorbed by the ocean.

The report also noted biological findings like the northward shift of marine life and fisheries along the U.S. East Coast and more summer vegetation in the Arctic region.","The planet’s changing atmosphere and oceans hit several record thresholds last year, according to an international report published by the American Meteorological Society."

But Trump isn’t speaking the same language. In his first tweet on Charlottesville, he offered a vague denunciation.

It’s an odd combination of reactions given the events that unfolded. Rally-goers first descended on the city late Friday night, carrying torches in an attempt to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from the UVA campus. The rally quickly descended into violence and was dispersed by police.

By noon Saturday, the group of alt-right white nationalists grew to include tangles of neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. A militia arrived heavily armed.

First lady Melania Trump tweeted more directly at Charlottesville, saying, “let’s communicate w/o hate in our hearts.”

In response to the president’s tweet, Signer wrote that “our work here is just beginning. Yours is too.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions also released a statement decrying “the violence in Charlottesville and any message of hate and intolerance.”

The legislation marks yet another major VA reform bill under the Trump Administration aimed at helping veterans.

“We’re working night and day to ensure our brave veterans are provided with world-class treatment,” President Trump said.

The Veteran’s Affairs Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 provides further funds the Veterans Choice Fund, extending the VA Choice Program for an additional six months.

The VA Choice Program authorizes veterans who live farther than 40 miles from a VA facility, or those who cannot get an appointment with the VA in under 30 days, to access care outside the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Further, this legislation authorizes 28 major medical facility leases and puts in place reforms to strengthen the VA’s ability to train, recruit and retain its workforce.

In July, President Trump signed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, the biggest reform bill in the history of the department. Since it became law, more than 500 employees have been fired and over 180 suspended for misconduct. He signed the Veterans Choice Act, which begins permitting qualified veterans to get the care of their choice.

President Trump also addressed the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which white supremacists clashed with leftwing groups such as Antifa and Black Lives Matter.

“We must remember this truth: no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first,” he said. “Our citizens must restore the bonds of trust and loyalty between one another. We have to respect each other. Ideally, we have to love each other.”

The signing of the bill by President Trump followed several scandals during the Obama Administration that included veterans dying while waiting to get appointments at VA hospitals, most notably in Phoenix, Arizona.

At a facility in Tomah, Wisconsin, patients called the chief of staff the “Candy Man” because he widely distributed narcotics for a $4,000 bonus, even after a patient named Jason Simcakoski died of an overdose. Incredibly, this was after an investigation uncovered that he was overprescribing.

The previous administration repeatedly claimed to have learned of the conditions at these VA facilities only after news reports exposed them, including allegations from a doctor at the Huntington VA Medical Center in Charleston, West Virginia.

Dr. Margaret Moxness, a psychiatrist, said in 2014 she was ordered to delay the treatment of veterans for months and that at least two of them had committed suicide.

(AP) -- The Latest on the white nationalist rally being held in Charlottesville (all times local):

Virginia state police said one of their agency's helicopters crashed Saturday outside Charlottesville, killing two troopers.

Police said the helicopter was assisting law enforcement officers monitoring the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.

Police said Lt. H. Jay Cullen of Midlothian and Trooper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton were killed in the crash.

The crash happened just a few hours after a car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting against the white nationalist rally. One person was killed and at least two dozen were hurt.

This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates' first name. It had been spelled Burke.

Officials say the deaths of two people in a helicopter crash near Charlottesville, Virginia, have been linked to a violent white nationalist rally earlier in the day.

It was not immediately clear how the crash was connected to the rally. Corinne Geller, a Virignia State Police spokeswoman, says the pilot and a passenger were killed in the crash Saturday afternoon.

The crash happened just a few hours after a car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting against the white nationalist rally. One person was killed and at least two dozen were hurt.

The organizer of a rally that drew hundreds of white nationalists and other extremists to Charlottesville says he disavows the violence that eroded it.

Jason Kessler said in an interview Saturday evening that whoever drove a car into a group of counter-protesters ""did the wrong thing."" He said he was saddened that people were hurt.

Kessler is a local blogger and activist who described the event as a pro-white rally. He planned it to protest the city's decision to remove a Confederate monument.

He also criticized law enforcement's response to the event, which was dispersed before speakers could take the stage.

He said they did a poor job controlling the chaos to allow free speech.

A state official said the driver of a car that plowed into a group of marchers in Charlottesville is in police custody.

Virginia Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran said the driver, a man, has been arrested.

Moran did not immediately provide a name of the driver.

Witnesses say a car plowed into a crowd of people who were protesting a rally, which was held by white nationalists who oppose the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee by the city of Charlottesville. Officials say one person was killed and at least 26 were treated at local hospitals.

A hospital official says one person has died and 19 were injured after a car plowed into a group of protesters in Charlottesville.

University of Virginia Medical Center spokeswoman Angela Taylor confirmed the death to The Associated Press.

The mayor of Charlottesville said via Twitter on Saturday that he is ""heartbroken"" to announce that a ""life has been lost."" He did not provide details.

Witnesses say a car plowed into a crowd of people who were protesting the rally, which was held by white nationalists who oppose the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee by the city of Charlottesville.

Officials say there are multiple injuries after a car plowed into a group of people marching peacefully in downtown Charlottesville.

Video of the incident shows a silver Dodge Charger crashing into a car where protesters were marching and then rapidly reversing away.

Michael Nigro, a photojournalist from Brooklyn, told reporters shortly after the incident he heard the screech of tires and saw a gray Charger accelerate toward the group. Several hundred people were peacefully marching through downtown.

Nigro says it was ""chaos and mayhem"" as bodies flew.

Officials didn't immediately release any further information and it wasn't immediately clear if anyone was in custody.

Authorities are on the scene after a vehicle plowed into a group of people marching peacefully through downtown Charlottesville.

An Associated Press reporter saw at least one person on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately afterward the incident. It occurred approximately two hours after violent clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters.

The nationalists were holding the rally to protest plans by the city of Charlottesville to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

There were several hundred protesters marching in a long line when the car drove into a group of them.

President Donald Trump is tweeting about the violence that has erupted amid a white supremacist march in Virginia.

Trump tweeted Saturday that ""we ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for."" He then wrote ""There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

The demonstrations began Friday in Charlottesville with white nationalists marching through town and while carrying lit torches. The demonstrators then clashed with counter-protesters.

Some of the white nationalists cited Trump's victory as validation for their beliefs.

The White House was silent for hours about the clashes except for a solitary tweet from First Lady Melania Trump. The president has received previous criticism for being slow to condemn acts of hate done in his name.

The organizer of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville is encouraging attendees to leave town after authorities declared an unlawful assembly and police ordered people to disperse.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler organized Saturday's rally to protest the city's decision to remove a statue of confederate General Robert E. Lee.

Kessler told The Associated Press Saturday that he and other people who were going to speak at the event evacuated with security when police issued the order to disperse.

He says he wants rally attendees to leave town peacefully.

Richard Spencer is a prominent alt-right activist who was scheduled to speak. He says he's also encouraging people to go home.

First Lady Melania Trump is calling for peace after violent clashes broke out at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.

Trump said Saturday on Twitter: ""Our country encourages freedom of speech, but let's communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence.""

Hundreds of white nationalists and counter protestors faced off Saturday in downtown Charlottesville, with several violent clashes erupting.

It's the latest confrontation in the city since it voted to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a downtown park.

The NHL's Detroit Red Wings released a statement denouncing the use of their logo at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and saying they are considering legal action to stop it.

The team says it ""vehemently"" disagrees with and is not associated with the event. The Red Wings add they are ""exploring every possible legal action as it pertains to the misuse of our logo in this disturbing demonstration.""

A Michigan-based white nationalist group called the Detroit Right Wings uses the Red Wings' logo. The organization posted on its Twitter account that members had arrived in Charlottesville.

Virginia's governor has declared a state of emergency in response to a white nationalist rally that is expected to draw up to 6,000 people.

Gov. Terry McAuliffe said via his Twitter account on Saturday morning that the declaration was made in order ""to aid state response to violence"" at the rally in Charlottesville, about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C.

It's the latest confrontation in the city since it voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a downtown park.

The city's manager also declared a local emergency and police ordered people to disperse from the area around the statue after several violent clashes broke out.

Hundreds of people are facing off in Charlottesville ahead of a white nationalist rally planned in the Virginia city's downtown.

Rally supporters and counter-protesters screamed, chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays on each other Saturday morning.

Men dressed in militia uniforms were carrying shields and openly carrying long guns.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler planned what he called a ""pro-white"" rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park. Thousands of people are expected to pack the area.

There were also fights Friday night, when hundreds of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches.

In the most extreme incident, 20-year-old white nationalist James Alex Fields plowed his car into a group of counterprotestors, killing one person, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, and injuring 19. Fields has been charged with second-degree murder, and the Department of Justice announced a civil rights investigation into the incident.

Two state troopers were also killed when their helicopter, which had been assisting with the police response to the rally, crashed outside the city later in the day.

The violent clashes in Charlottesville injured at least another 14 people beyond the car attack, and led Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe to declare a state of emergency late Saturday morning. President Trump also spoke out against the violence, though not the rally, in a tweet and in an afternoon statement to reporters.

Below is an overview of what we know — and don’t know — as of Sunday morning.

The Hit-and-Run Attack on Protestors

Graphic videos and images of the horrific car attack and its aftermath were posted on social media. They show a grey Dodge Challenger accelerating into a crowd of protestors near Water and Fourth Streets in Charlottesville, crashing into both people and rear-ending another car, then reversing into more people:

A 32-year-old woman was killed in the collision and another 19 people were injured — including five critically. Many are already calling the incident an act of domestic terrorism, but it was not originally known if the driver acted out of panic or malice. His motive is still not confirmed, but he has been charged with second-degree murder, among other crimes related to the incident.

The Driver

Authorities say they have arrested a 20-year-old Ohio man James Alex Fields Jr. and charged him with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and failing to stop at the scene of a crash that resulted in a death. He was arrested after fleeing the scene of the collision with protestors. Authorities have not identified him as the driver of the car used in the attack, but that car was registered to a man of the same name and age. Fields is being held without bail and will be arraigned on Monday.

It is not yet confirmed why Fields crashed into the protestors, but more details emerged about him over the weekend. He apparently lives in Maumee, Ohio, near Toledo, and the Toledo Blade reports that, according to his mother, he was in Charlottesville to attend the white-nationalist rally, though she said she didn’t know much about it. She said that she tried to “stay out of his political views,” but that he had dropped off his cat so he could go to an alt-right rally in Virginia. “I thought it had something to do with Trump,” she told the Blade. They had moved to Ohio from Kentucky last year, and James had moved out of her apartment five-to-six months ago.

Buzzfeed News additionally reports that a Facebook page that appeared to belong to Fields featured posts showing alt-right memes, making references to Nazism and white supremacy, and indicating support for President Trump. Fields was also photographed holding symbols of the Vanguard America white supremacist group on Saturday, but the group denies they had any ties to him.

Fields’s former high school history teacher told the Cincinnati Enquirer that Fields was “very bright” but also misguided and disillusioned. According to the teacher, Derek Weimer, Fields took a special interest in Nazi history and ideals:

Weimar also lamented, with regards to what happened Saturday, that “I feel like I failed and that we all failed.”

Fields registered as a Republican last year and voted in both Ohio’s primary and last year’s presidential election. It also appears that Fields served in the U.S. Army for about four months in 2015, but left for reasons that are not yet clear.

The FBI announced on Saturday night that they were opening a federal civil-rights investigation into the hit-and-run.

The Victims of the Car Attack and Clashes

A 32-year-old Virginia woman, Heather Heyer, was killed in the hit-and-run. She was struck while crossing the street. She worked as a paralegal in Charlottesville, where she also lived. She came to the rally as a counterprotester on Saturday.

Friends have set up an online fundraiser at GoFundMe for her family. On that page, a statement from Heyer’s mother reads, “She died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.”

Heyer’s mother also gave a heart-wrenching interview to HuffPost about her daughter’s activism and charity, and expressed her sorrow over whatever led her daughter’s alleged murderer to do what he did.

Her last public post on Facebook, published a few weeks after last year’s presidential election, was the quote, “If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention.”

For more about Heyer and how her friends and family are remembering her, head here.

The University of Virginia Medical Center reports that another 19 people were injured when the car plowed into the crowd, including five people who were admitted to the hospital in critical condition. It is not clear if they were all counterprotestors or not, but it seems likely that most of them were. None of those victims, or any of the other injured, have been officially identified.

Fourteen more people were injured in clashes throughout the day, but little is yet known about them except that none experienced life-threatening injuries.

Two state police officers were also killed in a helicopter crash on Saturday afternoon.

The Helicopter Crash

The violent clashes and car-ramming attack were not the only tragedies to strike Charlottesville on Saturday. Late in the afternoon, after the unrest had been quelled, two state troopers were killed when their helicopter crashed near a golf course about seven miles southwest of the city. The helicopter had been conducting surveillance on clashes in Charlottesville. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the crash, but the men killed in the crash have been identified as 48-year-old H. Jay Cullen and the pilot, Berke M.M. Bates, who was one day shy of his 41st birthday.

The “Unite the Right” White-Nationalist Rally and Subsequent Violence

A major white-nationalist rally had been planned for Saturday in Charlottesville. Organizers hoped to mount the largest white-nationalist rally in decades, and was focused on the idea that the assembled would “take America back” and protest the upcoming removal of a statue of Confederate icon Robert E. Lee from Charlottesville’s Emancipation Park (which was formerly known as Lee Park). Hundreds of white nationalists, including neo-Nazis, members of the Ku Klux Klan, and other white-supremacist groups, descended on the city on Friday and Saturday, many carrying flags with swastikas and other racist logos and chanting Nazi slogans like “Blood and soil!” Rally attendees, carrying torches, also marched across the mostly empty campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville on Friday night.

The white-nationalist rally also attracted counterprotestors, and when rally attendees attempted to march in Charlottesville on Saturday morning, they were met by those protestors, leading to violent clashes.

As Charlottesville’s The Daily Progress reports in detail, some people on both sides of the conflict came ready to fight, armed with weapons and wearing defensive gear. They hurled rocks and other projectiles at each other, swung clublike weapons, and reportedly released pepper spray and other substances into the air as cops initially stood back.

ProPublica notes that the white supremacists who arrived on Saturday “had spent months openly planning for war”:

The resulting violence was well-documented on social media:

The State of Emergency and (Late) Police Intervention

Because of the escalating violence, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency at about 11 a.m., and police ordered the rally attendees and counterprotestors to disperse or face arrest. They were able to evacuate Emancipation Park, but clashes continued throughout the city during the dispersal.

“It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property,” Governor McAuliffe explained. The governor, whose order activated the Virginia National Guard, also said that he was “disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours.”

In all, it appears that at least 14 people were admitted to University of Virginia Medical Center for injuries sustained in the street clashes, in addition to the 19 people who were injured and one person who was killed when a car rammed into counterprotestors, which occurred after the rally was mostly broken up by police.

Charlottesville authorities are already being criticized for their delayed and inadequate response to the rally, their restraint after things starting going haywire, and their general inability to prevent the ensuing violence. ProPublica reports that despite weeks of detailed planning by officials on how to handle the event, “[I]t appears that the strategy was to avoid direct confrontations with the protesters,” and that didn’t work at all.

The Washington Post talked to a former police chief who was puzzled by how police responded to the rally:

Other reports indicate some of the militia-types did more than the police to break up fights, at least in the beginning.

On Saturday night, the Charlottesville City Council issued an emergency ordinance allowing authorities to institute a curfew in an effort to prevent further violence. There were also other arrests made on Saturday in addition to the hit-and-run driver Fields:

The Response From Trump and the White House

As news of the clashes spread, U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle quickly condemned the violence, most notable among them President Trump, who initially responded on Twitter:

The Department of Homeland Security, as well as White House Homeland Security advisor Tom Bossert, then offered their assistance to McAuliffe and local authorities.

On Saturday afternoon, before a scheduled event related to veterans’ health care, President Trump first gave a statement to his press pool about the violence in Charlottesville. In those remarks, he condemned “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence” on “many sides,” and seemed to try to distance Saturday’s events from his presidency.

Trump’s oddly worded tweets and statement, which conspicuously didn’t mention white nationalism or neo-Nazis, was not surprising given his long history of hesitating to speak out against white-on-minority violence, despite his willingness to condemn a lot of other things. Such an omission also aligned with his administration’s apparent priorities: In June, the Trump administration dropped DHS funding for a group dedicated to de-radicalizing white-nationalist extremists.

President Trump also offered his condolences, via Twitter on Saturday night, to the families of the woman who was killed in the car incident, as well as the two state troopers who died in the helicopter crash.

The Response From Other Republicans

Republican leaders quickly spoke out, but did so much like Trump: issuing anodyne (and in Mitch McConnell’s case, confusing) statements that failed to address why the rally in Charlottesville was taking place, and which seemed to take a “both sides” approach to the violent rioting.

But later, after President Trump failed to condemn white nationalism in his afternoon remarks, GOP lawmakers were bolder in their denunciations:

This post has been updated throughout to reflect new details about Saturday’s events.","Everything we now know about Saturday’s violence, including the identity of the driver who allegedly rammed his car into protestors, killing one."

Declares State of Emergency as White Nationalist Rally Turns Violent,"Fights erupted and at least eight people were hurt when white nationalists and counter-protesters violently clashed Saturday, forcing Charlottesville police and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to declare a state of emergency.

Supporters gathered in Emancipation Park Saturday morning in anticipation of a noon rally held by ""Unite the Right."" The aim of the rally was to protest the removal of a statue honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The park was formerly known as Lee Park.

State police and members of the Virginia National Guard surrounded the park after McAuliffe declared a state of emergency and the city of Charlottesville declared the alt-right protest an unlawful assembly — effectively cancelling the demonstration before its planned start time.

The Charlottesville Police Department reported that, as of 12:30 p.m. ET, it had made a single arrest and emergency medical personnel had responded to eight injuries.

But those may not be the only injuries related to the event. A video made after 1 p.m. ET and posted to social media appeared to show a car plow into a group of marchers as they walked through streets.

The CPD estimated between 2,000 and 6,000 people were expected to attend the ""Unite the Right"" rally, according to local paper The Daily Progress. The controversial event was seeking to unify the far-right wing and ""affirm the right of Southerners and white people to organize for their interests,"" according to its Facebook page.

McAuliffe said he declared a state of emergency to allow for a response to quell the violence.

“It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property,"" McAuliffe said in a statement released shortly before noon. ""I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours.""

White nationalists, as well as apparent neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members, were met in opposition by clergy members and other groups, who stood in a line singing ""This Little Light of Mine"" to drown out the profanity and slurs.

""Love has already won. We have already won,"" the counter-protesters responded early Saturday.

But as the violence intensified with shoving and punching, demonstrators covered their mouths after tear gas was apparently released into the crowd.

Two people were also treated for serious but non-life-threatening injuries near Emancipation Park, the city of Charlottesville tweeted, as tensions flared with back-and-forth shouting and physical posturing.

A large group of counter-protesters wore black shirts and masks and carried shields, yelling to the white nationalists: ""We have replaced you. Strong, united, interracial crew.""

Once the violence had mostly come to an end, President Donald Trump denounced the clashes via a tweet that called for ""ALL"" to be united in their condemnation of hate.

Michael Signer, the Democratic mayor of Charlottesville, responded to Trump with a tweet of his own.

The city and Albemarle County both issued a ""declaration of local emergency"" for the two jurisdictions to request additional resources.

McAuliffe said that his entire team would continue to monitor the situation and continue to coordinate with Virginia State Police, Virginia National Guard, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management as well as local and state officials.

""Local officials continue to closely monitor the situation,"" Charlottesville police added on Facebook.

The University of Virginia, located in Charlottesville, cancelled all events and programming on the school's campus.

The rally followed a night of torch-wielding white supremacists clashing with counter-protesters at the University of Virginia. Chants of ""You will not replace us!"" and ""Blood and soil!"" were met with shouts of ""No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!""

Reuters and a number of local reports put the number of protester Friday in the hundreds. The Washington Post reported that the march lasted between 15 and 20 minutes.

At least one person was arrested Friday night and several others treated for minor injuries, according to The Daily Progress. Both sides reported being hit with pepper spray, the newspaper added.

Rep. Don Beyer, D.-Va., tweeted Saturday morning that ""white supremacists chanting Nazi slogans aren't Virginia or America. They are weak, ignorant, fearful people with citronella tiki torches.""

In videos posted to social media from Friday night, the white supremacists can be seen goading their opposition with shouts of ""Jews will not replace us"" and ""white lives matter.""

The display drew condemnation from local and university officials.

""I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behavior displayed by torch-bearing protesters that marched on our grounds this evening,"" University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan said in a statement. ""I strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including university personnel who were attempting to maintain order.""

""The violence displayed on the grounds is intolerable and is entirely inconsistent with the university's values,"" Sullivan added.

Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer called the demonstration a ""cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism and intolerance.""

The legislation marks yet another major VA reform bill under the Trump Administration aimed at helping veterans.

“We’re working night and day to ensure our brave veterans are provided with world-class treatment,” President Trump said.

The Veteran’s Affairs Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 provides further funds the Veterans Choice Fund, extending the VA Choice Program for an additional six months.

The VA Choice Program authorizes veterans who live farther than 40 miles from a VA facility, or those who cannot get an appointment with the VA in under 30 days, to access care outside the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Further, this legislation authorizes 28 major medical facility leases and puts in place reforms to strengthen the VA’s ability to train, recruit and retain its workforce.

In July, President Trump signed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, the biggest reform bill in the history of the department. Since it became law, more than 500 employees have been fired and over 180 suspended for misconduct. He signed the Veterans Choice Act, which begins permitting qualified veterans to get the care of their choice.

President Trump also addressed the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which white supremacists clashed with leftwing groups such as Antifa and Black Lives Matter.

“We must remember this truth: no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first,” he said. “Our citizens must restore the bonds of trust and loyalty between one another. We have to respect each other. Ideally, we have to love each other.”

The signing of the bill by President Trump followed several scandals during the Obama Administration that included veterans dying while waiting to get appointments at VA hospitals, most notably in Phoenix, Arizona.

At a facility in Tomah, Wisconsin, patients called the chief of staff the “Candy Man” because he widely distributed narcotics for a $4,000 bonus, even after a patient named Jason Simcakoski died of an overdose. Incredibly, this was after an investigation uncovered that he was overprescribing.

The previous administration repeatedly claimed to have learned of the conditions at these VA facilities only after news reports exposed them, including allegations from a doctor at the Huntington VA Medical Center in Charleston, West Virginia.

Dr. Margaret Moxness, a psychiatrist, said in 2014 she was ordered to delay the treatment of veterans for months and that at least two of them had committed suicide.

(AP) -- The Latest on the white nationalist rally being held in Charlottesville (all times local):

Virginia state police said one of their agency's helicopters crashed Saturday outside Charlottesville, killing two troopers.

Police said the helicopter was assisting law enforcement officers monitoring the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville.

Police said Lt. H. Jay Cullen of Midlothian and Trooper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton were killed in the crash.

The crash happened just a few hours after a car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting against the white nationalist rally. One person was killed and at least two dozen were hurt.

This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates' first name. It had been spelled Burke.

Officials say the deaths of two people in a helicopter crash near Charlottesville, Virginia, have been linked to a violent white nationalist rally earlier in the day.

It was not immediately clear how the crash was connected to the rally. Corinne Geller, a Virignia State Police spokeswoman, says the pilot and a passenger were killed in the crash Saturday afternoon.

The crash happened just a few hours after a car plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting against the white nationalist rally. One person was killed and at least two dozen were hurt.

The organizer of a rally that drew hundreds of white nationalists and other extremists to Charlottesville says he disavows the violence that eroded it.

Jason Kessler said in an interview Saturday evening that whoever drove a car into a group of counter-protesters ""did the wrong thing."" He said he was saddened that people were hurt.

Kessler is a local blogger and activist who described the event as a pro-white rally. He planned it to protest the city's decision to remove a Confederate monument.

He also criticized law enforcement's response to the event, which was dispersed before speakers could take the stage.

He said they did a poor job controlling the chaos to allow free speech.

A state official said the driver of a car that plowed into a group of marchers in Charlottesville is in police custody.

Virginia Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran said the driver, a man, has been arrested.

Moran did not immediately provide a name of the driver.

Witnesses say a car plowed into a crowd of people who were protesting a rally, which was held by white nationalists who oppose the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee by the city of Charlottesville. Officials say one person was killed and at least 26 were treated at local hospitals.

A hospital official says one person has died and 19 were injured after a car plowed into a group of protesters in Charlottesville.

University of Virginia Medical Center spokeswoman Angela Taylor confirmed the death to The Associated Press.

Officials say there are multiple injuries after a car plowed into a group of people marching peacefully in downtown Charlottesville.

Video of the incident shows a silver Dodge Charger crashing into a car where protesters were marching and then rapidly reversing away.

Michael Nigro, a photojournalist from Brooklyn, told reporters shortly after the incident he heard the screech of tires and saw a gray Charger accelerate toward the group. Several hundred people were peacefully marching through downtown.

Nigro says it was ""chaos and mayhem"" as bodies flew.

Officials didn't immediately release any further information and it wasn't immediately clear if anyone was in custody.

Authorities are on the scene after a vehicle plowed into a group of people marching peacefully through downtown Charlottesville.

An Associated Press reporter saw at least one person on the ground receiving medical treatment immediately afterward the incident. It occurred approximately two hours after violent clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters.

The nationalists were holding the rally to protest plans by the city of Charlottesville to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

There were several hundred protesters marching in a long line when the car drove into a group of them.

President Donald Trump is tweeting about the violence that has erupted amid a white supremacist march in Virginia.

Trump tweeted Saturday that ""we ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for."" He then wrote ""There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

The demonstrations began Friday in Charlottesville with white nationalists marching through town and while carrying lit torches. The demonstrators then clashed with counter-protesters.

Some of the white nationalists cited Trump's victory as validation for their beliefs.

The White House was silent for hours about the clashes except for a solitary tweet from First Lady Melania Trump. The president has received previous criticism for being slow to condemn acts of hate done in his name.

The organizer of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville is encouraging attendees to leave town after authorities declared an unlawful assembly and police ordered people to disperse.

Hundreds of white nationalists and counter protestors faced off Saturday in downtown Charlottesville, with several violent clashes erupting.

It's the latest confrontation in the city since it voted to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a downtown park.

The NHL's Detroit Red Wings released a statement denouncing the use of their logo at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and saying they are considering legal action to stop it.

The team says it ""vehemently"" disagrees with and is not associated with the event. The Red Wings add they are ""exploring every possible legal action as it pertains to the misuse of our logo in this disturbing demonstration.""

A Michigan-based white nationalist group called the Detroit Right Wings uses the Red Wings' logo. The organization posted on its Twitter account that members had arrived in Charlottesville.

Virginia's governor has declared a state of emergency in response to a white nationalist rally that is expected to draw up to 6,000 people.

But racist rhetoric has become a hallmark of the movement, from the use of “cuck” to deride anti-alt-right conservatives to Twitter harassment of Jewish journalists by Photoshopping them into images of Nazi gas chambers.

That crosses the line into ideologies that most Americans agree are taboo. People may believe that Donald Trump supporters aren’t necessarily racists, but they are willing to agree that members of the Klan and Nazis are racists. Indeed, it’s a contrast with those groups that allows some people to draw the line between “real racism” and liberals “crying wolf” about racism. (This is true outside the alt-right as well — just look at pro-Trump commentator Jeffrey Lord, fired by CNN this week after tweeting “Sieg heil!” in what he claims was a joke.)

Instead of responding by deliberately distancing themselves from white nationalism, though, leaders of the alt-right have deliberately blurred the distinction. They’ve adopted memes and hand gestures (like the “okay” symbol) as an inside joke, because people outside the movement have mistaken them for white nationalist symbols. The attitude tends to be that if “the left” is going to see them as Nazis, they might as well encourage that conception.",The alt-right rally was a coming-out party for resurgent white nationalism in America.

The governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency Saturday after violent clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville. Police ordered crowds to disperse as chaotic and violent scenes erupted around the city. Groups clashed in fist fights, with batons and threw newspaper boxes at each other. Some carried sticks and shields, and wore helmets. The planned demonstration by a white supremacist group was protesting the removal of a statute of Confederate Gen. Robert E.

The rally, scheduled to begin at noon, was cancelled this morning.

Jason Kessler, the leader of a white supremacist group and organizer of the demonstration, said the rally was cancelled around 11:30 a.m. when the Charlottesville Police “declared an unlawful assembly and forced us to leave.” “Our speakers, including Richard Spencer, were Maced by protesters on the way into the park and the police did nothing to stop them,” said Mr. Kessler, 33-years-old and the president of “Unity and Security for America.” He had dubbed the demonstration “Unite the Right” and has been working with the American Civil Liberties Union to gain access to the park. . . . . Men dressed in militia uniforms were carrying shields and openly carrying long guns, the Associated Press reported. Officials had been preparing for the rally for months. Police instituted road closures around downtown, and many businesses in the popular open-air shopping mall opted to close for the day. Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on call.

The state of Virginia shortly after declared the gathering unlawful and ordered both rallygoers and counterprotesters to “disperse immediately.” The Virginia State Police posted videos on Facebook of officers breaking up the Unite the Right gathering and counterprotest . . . One video shows an officer in announcing to milling crowds: “This gathering has been declared as to be an unlawful assembly; in the name of the Commonwealth, you are commanded to immediately disperse; if you do not disperse immediately you will be arrested.” Another video shows some of the crowd.

The counter-protesters were organized; Cornel West spoke at last night’s counter-protest prayer service.

A mass prayer service was held at St. Paul’s Memorial Church on University Avenue that was organized in response to the rally, according to The Daily Progress, a local paper. Dr. Cornel West, a prominent leftist philosopher and political activist, spoke at the prayer service, calling the “Unite the Right” rally the “biggest gathering of a hate-driven right wing in the history of this country in the last 30 to 35 years,” the Daily Progress reported.

So far, one person has been arrested and several have been injured. A car also plowed into a group of protesters on the street, but Fox News is now reporting that it’s not clear at this time that the driver was not trying to get away from the crowd that was throwing “projectiles.”

Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller told Fox News that three vehicles had collided and multiple injuries, ranging from life-threatening to minor, had been reported. Geller added that the car seen backing away with a smashed hood in the above video had been located. No arrests had been reported in connection with the incident and authorities said they had not determined whether the crash was intentional. . . . . As of early afternoon, a single arrest has been reported. Local reports said a car has rammed into a group of counter-protesters, injuring an unknown amount of people. An Associated Press reporter said they witnessed at least one person on the ground receiving medical treatment. . . . . The Virginia State Police tweeted that officers had made arrests following the unlawful assembly declaration. The Virginia National Guard has also been deployed. Local police estimated that at least 6,000 people are in attendance. Among those expected to attend are Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and “alt-right” activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.

Charlottesville’s mayor was quick to blame President Trump for the planned protest.

President Trump and Vice President Pence have both tweeted their condemnation of the violence that has taken place in Virginia.

It is a seismic crash of historic proportions. And some of the most prominent Christian voices in the nation are standing by, watching their own people drown in the growing flood.

Today in Charlottesville, Virginia White nationalists—many of whom claim to be Christians—sought to define America. They spoke with one voice, with AR-15 rifles slung over their shoulders and Confederate Flags, Trump signs, and skull insignias on full display. They said that America is not a place for Jews and Blacks. They said Muslims and immigrants are not welcomed here. They also said that their rally ""fulfills the promises of Donald Trump""—David Duke's words, not mine. Duke, the Klan leader, continued: ""That's what we believed in, that's why we voted for Donald Trump—because he said he was going to take our country back."" Somebody went so far as to drive a car into a crowd, mowing down those who came to protest the nationalists. No muted tweets from the President today can change these stunning facts.

If anyone was unsure before, after Charlottesville we should all now know exactly what ""take our country back"" means. It means back to a place where whites have continued superiority in every part of American life. Back to a place where Blacks, Jews, Latinos, Asians, and immigrants, Muslims, women, gays and more live in relative subjugation. The haters have spoken and they are clear. What is not clear is the position of many Christian leaders, especially in the white (and even some in the Latino) Evangelical church.

Deafening silence from the pulpits in Orange County. Telling quiet from the mega-churches in Atlanta. Nashville, muted. The folks at Liberty University—the president and his activist friends—on the careful moral sidelines of this fight. Wheaton and Manhattan and Chicago and more, tentative and couched. Perhaps they'll echo Trump's ambiguous condemnation. Perhaps we'll hear nothing at all.

These evangelical pastors and Christian activists, authors, and leaders are fearful. They are fearful of sanction from congregations where people in the pews may have voted for a morally problematic candidate because they did not like the alternatives. They're fearful of losing their platforms, book sales, positions if they stray too far. They are fearful of having their club membership revoked. But as they stand in fear they are also slowing ceding moral authority. They stand while the nation—even the world—simmers and threatens to burn.

My friend LeVar Burton said today that ""this moment is but another in a chain of opportunities to choose what you stand for."" It is an opportunity, indeed. Far too many in the Christian church sanctioned slavery. Many purported Christians even owned, bought and sold human beings themselves. Evangelicals took decades to stand against Jim Crow, and only stood when the fight was long over. From Apartheid in South Africa to women's rights here at home, far too many Christian pastors and leaders moved when it was safe, if at all.

They may have a heart for digging wells in Africa or a passion to end the scourge of human trafficking; these issues are centrally important, but they are also safe, problems that everyone agrees we need to solve. But when it comes to the more complex moral disasters right in front of us, the fire of courage often fails to burn. This is why many evangelicals hold on so dearly to the history of William Wilberforce, the 18th Century Christian abolitionist The tale of Wilberforce makes them feel courageous, although the courage he showed hundreds of years ago is a far cry from what we see today. Today, courage is in short supply. We are grateful for conservative pastors and leaders like Dr. Russell Moore, Dr. Joel Hunter, even Erick Erickson and others who speak out at risk to themselves, but they should not have to stand alone.

What would it mean for evangelical Christian leaders to speak out in the age of Trump? It means consistently leveraging public platforms and private leadership to define what is right and wrong. In the case of what we just saw in Charlottesville, it means sermon series on the dangers of white supremacy, the reality of privilege, and the importance of empathy for those who do not look like you. It means using podcasts and books and voices to lift up morality and condemn immorality, whether that immortality is found in the streets of Charlottesville or the Oval Office of the White House. It even means admitting with humility that they don't know what to do, but know they should do something, and then showing an openness to take action.","['White nationalists have already gathered with their torches.

Lee statue, and counter-protesters.

The governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency Saturday after violent clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville. Police ordered crowds to disperse as chaotic and violent scenes erupted around the city. Groups clashed in fist fights, with batons and threw newspaper boxes at each other. Some carried sticks and shields, and wore helmets. The planned demonstration by a white supremacist group was protesting the removal of a statute of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville. . . . . Police declared an unlawful assembly in the city. and Gov. Terry McAuliffe decried the violence. “The acts and rhetoric in #Charlottesville over past 24 hours are unacceptable & must stop,” the governor tweeted. “A right to speech is not a right to violence.”

The rally, scheduled to begin at noon, was cancelled this morning.

Jason Kessler, the leader of a white supremacist group and organizer of the demonstration, said the rally was cancelled around 11:30 a.m. when the Charlottesville Police “declared an unlawful assembly and forced us to leave.” “Our speakers, including Richard Spencer, were Maced by protesters on the way into the park and the police did nothing to stop them,” said Mr. Kessler, 33-years-old and the president of “Unity and Security for America.” He had dubbed the demonstration “Unite the Right” and has been working with the American Civil Liberties Union to gain access to the park. . . . . Men dressed in militia uniforms were carrying shields and openly carrying long guns, the Associated Press reported. Officials had been preparing for the rally for months. Police instituted road closures around downtown, and many businesses in the popular open-air shopping mall opted to close for the day. Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on call.

The state of Virginia shortly after declared the gathering unlawful and ordered both rallygoers and counterprotesters to “disperse immediately.” The Virginia State Police posted videos on Facebook of officers breaking up the Unite the Right gathering and counterprotest . . . One video shows an officer in announcing to milling crowds: “This gathering has been declared as to be an unlawful assembly; in the name of the Commonwealth, you are commanded to immediately disperse; if you do not disperse immediately you will be arrested.” Another video shows some of the crowd.

One person was killed and more than 19 others were injured in Charlottesville, Virginia, after a car plowed through a group of counter-protesters who were demonstrating against an alt-right and white nationalist rally.

Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said a 32-year-old woman was killed and the suspect vehicle which fled was found moments later and a male driver was arrested.

Police on Saturday night said James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, was the person arrested and is charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of ""hit and run attended failure to stop with injury.""

Two Virginia State Police officials were also killed when a police helicopter assisting in law enforcement efforts in Charlottesville crashed southwest of the city at around 5 p.m., the state police and FAA said. Foul play is not suspected, according to the state police.

At 7:30 p.m., the University of Virginia Health System said it was still treating 19 patients from the car crash — five are in critical condition, four are in serious condition, six are fair and four are in good condition.

Described as a group of ""anti-racist protesters"" by a witness who took video of the crash, the group of marchers was packed close together at the end of a street near the intersection of Fourth and Water streets in downtown Charlottesville when the car struck.

Brennan Gilmore, a 37-year-old who works for a start up, shot the footage and said he heard tires squealing before he saw a car build up speed and ram the crowd. It hit a number of people before plowing into the bumper of another car.

""It was very clearly intentional,"" Gilmore told NBC News. ""From the far end of the street it accelerated, slowed down right before the crowd and then slammed on the gas through the crowd sending bodies flying. And then it reversed back into the street dragging bodies and clothes.""

Fields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told The Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn't know it was a white nationalist rally.

""I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,"" Bloom told the AP.

The FBI and Department of Justice have opened a civil-rights investigation into the deadly crash.

Thirty-five people overall were treated for injuries by city personnel Saturday, Thomas said, and 14 of those were hurt in ""individual engagements"" as violence flared amid the white nationalist rally and counter-protests. No injuries were reported from interactions with police, he said.

""The premeditated violence that our community experienced today was completely unacceptable,"" Thomas said at a press conference Saturday evening.

The two Virginia State Police officials killed in the helicopter crash were identified as the pilot, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and tropper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates. The cause of the Bell 407 crash is under investigation.

Ahead of the rally that was planned for noon, different groups of protesters clashed with hundreds of white nationalists, Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis throughout the day. They began to disperse after Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency and police told attendees to depart.

President Donald Trump called the series of events terrible, but was criticized for not providing a full-throated condemnation of the white nationalist elements of the protests, which included former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke and white nationalist leader Richard Spencer.

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many sides,"" the president said during a Saturday press conference. ""On many sides.""

When asked to clarify what the president meant by ""many sides,"" a White House official said Trump ""was condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides. There was violence between protesters and counter protesters today.""

Trump did not respond when reporters asked whether the Charlottesville car crash was terrorism or if he denounced white nationalism.

McAuliffe did not mince words during an evening press conference that was a clear rejection of ""the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today."" He simply told them to ""go home.""

""You came here today to hurt people, and you did hurt people,"" McAuliffe said. ""My message is clear: we are stronger than you. You have made our commonwealth stronger. You will not succeed. There is no place for you here. There is no place for you in America.""

Former President Barack Obama on Twitter posted a quote from Nelson Mandela Saturday that begins: ""People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love.""

Besides Fields, three people were arrested Saturday, Virginia state police said. A 21-year-old man from Chattanooga, Tennessee, was charged with disorderly conduct; a 44-year-old Gainesville, Florida, man was charged with carrying a concealed handgun; and a 21-year-old Virginia man was charged with assault and battery, police said.

On Friday night, torch-wielding white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus, which was condemned by the university president and other officials.

Friday and Saturday's alt-right rallies were held to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

Supporters gathered in Emancipation Park Saturday morning in anticipation of a noon rally held by ""Unite the Right."" The aim of the rally was to protest the removal of a statue honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The park was formerly known as Lee Park.

She was 87.

Pfau, while not widely covered in the Western media, was renowned in Pakistan for her efforts to stop the spread of leprosy, a bacterial infection also called Hansen’s disease that when untreated can cause disfigurement and blindness. Around the world, its victims have often been relegated to “leper colonies” and regarded as outcasts.

The Express Tribune of Pakistan once credited Pfau with having “single-handedly … turned the tide of leprosy in Pakistan and won the gratitude and personal attentions of people ranging from military rulers to elected ministers to the general public.”

Like Mother Teresa, the ethnic Albanian nun who became known as “the saint of the gutters” for her service to the destitute of India, Pfau lived among the people she cared for and by a vow of poverty.

As a young physician and nun, she had planned to begin her missionary work not in Pakistan, but in India, in 1960. Waylaid in Karachi with visa difficulties, she visited a leprosy colony and was so distressed by what she saw that she could not bring herself to leave.

The facility was overrun by rats and soiled by sewage. Speaking to the BBC in 2010, she recalled watching a young man as he “crawled on hands and feet into this dispensary, acting as if this was quite normal, as if someone has to crawl there through that slime and dirt on hands and feet, like a dog.”

“I could not believe that humans could live in such conditions,” she told the Express Tribune in 2014. “That one visit, the sights I saw during it, made me make a key life decision.”

After the war, with Leipzig under Soviet occupation, Pfau fled from East to West Germany to pursue her medical training, according to her biography on the website of the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre. She said she nearly married a fellow student before experiencing what she described as a calling from God.

“When you receive such a calling, you cannot turn it down, for it is not you who has made the choice,” she told the Express Tribune. “God has chosen you for Himself.”

She studied medicine at universities in Mainz and Marburg before joining the Catholic order of the Daughters of the Heart of Mary, the organization that sent her abroad as a missionary.

“We are like a Pakistani marriage,” she remarked. “It was an arranged marriage because it was necessary. We always and only fought with each other. But we never could go in for divorce because we had too many children.”","Dr. Ruth Pfau, a German nun who became known as the “Mother Teresa of Pakistan” for her decades-long ministry to the country’s leprosy patients, a moral and medical campaign that"

Early in the day, violence had broken out as the groups that planned the ""Unite the Right"" rally were met with counter protesters. After the rally, a car plowed into a crowd and a state police helicopter crashed outside the city.

Here's what we know now:

A 32-year-old woman was killed in the car crash, officials said.

Lt. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Va. and Trooper-Pilot Berke Bates, 40, of Quinton, Va. were killed in a helicopter crash outside the city, Virginia State Police said. Officials said the crash was linked to the rally but did not clarify how. President Trump tweeted his condolence to ""the families & fellow officers of the VA State Police who died.""

Thirty-five people were injured in clashes between opposing groups and in the car crash. At least nineteen were injured in the crash alone. Charlottesville police chief Al Thomas said the injuries ranged from life-threatening to minor.

Where is the driver now?

The driver has been taken into custody, Virginia Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran said. Albermarle County Regional Jail officials identified the suspect as 20-year-old Alex Fields, of Ohio.

Thomas said the driver will be charged with criminal homicide.

Why was there a protest?

White supremacist, alt-right, neo-Nazi and pro-Confederate groups were protesting the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park.

One of the main organizers was right-wing blogger Jason Kessler, who filed a lawsuit against the city. Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer opposed holding the rally near the Lee monument.

Late Friday, U.S. District Judge Glen Conrad ruled that the groups could hold hold the rally in the park.

Matthew Heimbach, an Indiana resident who has risen to prominence in the white nationalist movement, was also a key figure. Heimbach ordered his followers to push down the metal police barricades that cut the park into separate zones

President Trump denounced the violence, declaring that the ""hatred and division must stop.''

""I condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of violence and bigotry on many sides,"" he added.

He also tweeted condolences to the families of those killed after the rally.

Trump made his comments while also announcing his intention to sign a new Veterans Affairs bill.

Is the FBI or Department of Justice investigating?

Late Saturday U.S. officials announced that they have opened a civil rights investigation into the circumstances of the deadly car attack.

The investigation was announced Saturday night by officials of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Richmond field office of the FBI.

In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions says U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has begun the investigation and will have the full support of the Justice Department.

""The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,"" says Sessions in the statement. ""When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.""

Is this the first white supremacist rally in Charlottesville?

Beyond Saturday's planned rally, Charlottesville has been at the center of multiple white supremacist marches recently.

Several dozen torch-wielding demonstrators, led by prominent white supremacist Richard Spencer, gathered by the Lee statue on May 13 to protest the vote for its removal.

In July, Ku Klux Klan members held a rally in Charlottesville in Justice Park, where they were met with more than a thousand upset counter-protesters.

Statues of Confederate leaders nationwide have been removed in recent years as communities viewed them as symbols of slavery, but a USA TODAY analysis in May found that more than 700 Confederate monuments in 31 states still stand.

On Friday night, more than 200 torch-wielding protesters held a march through the heart of University of Virginia's campus after the ruling came down that allowed the protest to take place Saturday. Among their chants was: “You will not replace us.”

One arrest was made and several were injured after violence broke out. One of the injured was a UVA police officer hurt while making an arrest.

UVA President Teresa Sullivan “strongly condemned” the “intimidating and abhorrent behavior displayed by the alt-right protestors” on campus Friday night, and reaffirmed the university’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, as well as to First Amendment rights, the university said.

Will there be other rallies?

In a video posted by Spencer Saturday, the white nationalist leader expressed anger at the police response to the gathering — and pledged to return to the city of 46,000.

""We are going to make Charlottesville the center of the universe,"" Spencer said. ""We are going to come back here often. Your head's going to spin how many times we're going to be back down.""",At least one person is dead and 19 injured after a car plowed into a crowd at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.

White Nationalist Rally: 1 Dead After Car Crashes Into Crowd, 2 Troopers Dead in Helicopter Crash","Authorities have charged a 20-year-old Ohio man for the deadly car ramming incident in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday, as the Department of Justice announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash.

James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally Saturday in a Virginia college town, killing Heather Heyer, 32, hurting dozens more and ratcheting up tension in an increasingly violent confrontation.

Fields has been charged with one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of failing to stop, according to officials.

The two join previously announced performers J Balvin, Pitbull and Camila Cabello

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, meanwhile, said late Saturday that federal authorities were launching a civil rights investigation in response to the deadly ramming.

“The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,"" Sessions wrote in a statement. ""When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.""

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the FBI’s Richmond field office confirmed that they, along with the Civil Rights Division, opened an investigation into the circumstances of the deadly incident in Charlottesville, noting that they are collecting “all available facts and evidence.”

The chaos boiled over at what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade: the governor declared a state of emergency, police dressed in riot gear ordered people out and helicopters circled overhead. The group had gathered to protest plans to remove a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and others who arrived to protest the racism.

Virginia police arrested three others in relation to the unrest at the rally.

Troy Dunigan, 21, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct; Jacob L. Smith, 21, of Louisa, Virginia, was arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault and battery; and James M. O’Brien, 44, of Gainesville, Florida, was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed handgun.

Footage shows a vehicle appear to drive into a group of counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. Clashes between white nationalists and counter protesters had been ongoing on Aug. 12.

Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said counter-protesters were marching when ""suddenly there was just this tire screeching sound."" A silver sedan smashed into another car, then backed up, plowing through ""a sea of people.""

People scattered, running for safety in different directions, he said.

The incident happened about two hours after violent clashes broke out between the opposing groups.

Hundreds of people chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Over a dozen people were injured and one arrested in connection to the earlier violence, officials said.

Five patients were in critical condition Saturday evening, four in serious condition, six in fair condition and four in good condition, according to the University of Virginia Health System.

Adding to the chaos on Saturday, a helicopter that was assisting public safety resources with the rally in Charlottesville crashed and killed two Virginia state troopers later in the afternoon, Virginia police said.

The FAA is investigating the helicopter crash, and the National Transportation Safety Board will determine probable cause, NBC News reported. The pilot, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.

President Donald Trump, speaking Saturday afternoon from New Jersey where he has been on a working vacation, condemned the violence in Charlottesville, calling it an ""egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.""

""The hate and division must stop now,"" he said.

He did not respond to questions about whether he would denounce support from white nationalists.

A unnamed White House official clarified to NBC News about what the president meant by ""violence on many sides,"" saying that Trump was ""condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides. There was violence between protesters and counter protesters today.""

The attorney general of Virginia fired back at Trump's comment, saying, ""the violence, chaos, and apparent loss of life in Charlottesville is not the fault of 'many sides.' It is racists and white supremacists.""

Before the car crash, Trump condemned the earlier clashes on Twitter, writing, ""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

The president and his representatives have not yet acknowledged the death in the incident.

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia released a statement saying: ""We condemn the intolerance behind it and those who would pass it off as a legitimate political movement.""

First lady Melania Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan also took to social media to denounce the clashes between protesters and counter-protesters.

Small bands of protesters who showed up to express their opposition to the rally were seen marching around the city peacefully by midafternoon, chanting and waving flags. Helicopters circled overhead.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a ""pro-white"" rally to protest the city of Charlottesville's decision to remove the confederate statue from a downtown park.

Colleen Cook, 26, stood on a curb shouting at the rally attendees to go home.

Cook, a teacher who attended the University of Virginia, said she sent her son, who is black, out of town for the weekend.

It's weird, but it works

""This isn't how he should have to grow up,"" she said.

Cliff Erickson leaned against a fence and took in the scene. He said he thinks removing the statue amounts to erasing history and said the ""counter-protesters are crazier than the alt-right.""

""Both sides are hoping for a confrontation,"" he said.

It was the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C., voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and ""advocating for white people.""

""This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,"" he said in an interview.

Between rally attendees and counter-protesters, authorities were expecting as many as 6,000 people, Charlottesville police said this week.

Among those expected to attend were Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and ""alt-right"" activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.

Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which track extremist groups, said the event had the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.

Officials had been preparing for the rally for months.

Police instituted road closures around downtown, and many businesses in the popular open-air shopping mall opted to close for the day.

Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on call.

There were also fights Friday night, when hundreds of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches.

A university spokesman said one person was arrested and several people were injured.

Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer said he was disgusted that the white nationalists had come to his town and blamed President Donald Trump for inflaming racial prejudices with his campaign last year.

""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.""

""I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here,"" he wrote on Twitter later Saturday on Twitter. ""I urge all people of good will - go home.""



Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city that's home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.

The statue's removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville's history of race is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. They're now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.

For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials. A judge has agreed to a temporary injunction that blocks the city from removing the statue for six months.","Authorities have charged a 20-year-old Ohio man for the deadly car ramming incident in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday, as the Department of Justice announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash.

Even some traditional allies of Trump, like Senator Cory Gardner, have condemned Trump’s silence.

But one group of people were thrilled with Trump’s comments: the white supremacists themselves.

The popular white supremacist site Daily Stormer called Trump’s remarks “really good,” noting that he “didn’t attack us.” They were also pleased he ignored a question about white supremacists after making his statement.

Trump comments were good. He didn’t attack us. He just said the nation should come together. Nothing specific against us. He said that we need to study why people are so angry, and implied that there was hate… on both sides! So he implied the antifa are haters. There was virtually no counter-signaling of us at all. Also refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room.

Some commentators on the white nationalist message board Stormfront also praised Trump, with one noting that the president’s comments could just as easily be read as a criticism of Black Lives Matter.

Others on Stormfront were upset Trump didn’t take things further and actively support white nationalists.

This view was echoed by former KKK grand wizard David Duke.

Trump has, however, installed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon bragged that Breitbart, the website he ran before joining the Trump campaign, was “the platform for the alt-right.” The rally in Charlottesville was organized by the “alt-right,” which is a euphemism for white supremacists and white nationalists.

In the campaign, according to author Joshua Green, Bannon advised Trump to avoid criticizing white nationalists because it didn’t impact his polling.

When Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller recently unveiled the administration’s new immigration policy, he echoed arguments frequently advanced by white supremacists, including an unusual attack on the poem at the base of the Statue of Liberty.

Earlier this week another White House adviser, Sebastian Gorka, said people were being too critical of white supremacists. Gorka has drawn controversy for his own alleged ties to a Nazi group in Hungary.

White Nationalist Rally: 1 Dead After Car Crashes Into Crowd, 2 Troopers Dead in Helicopter Crash","Authorities have charged a 20-year-old Ohio man for the deadly car ramming incident in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday, as the Department of Justice announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash.

James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly plowed into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally Saturday in a Virginia college town, killing Heather Heyer, 32, hurting dozens more and ratcheting up tension in an increasingly violent confrontation.

Fields has been charged with one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of failing to stop, according to officials.

The two join previously announced performers J Balvin, Pitbull and Camila Cabello

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, meanwhile, said late Saturday that federal authorities were launching a civil rights investigation in response to the deadly ramming.

“The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,"" Sessions wrote in a statement. ""When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.""

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the FBI’s Richmond field office confirmed that they, along with the Civil Rights Division, opened an investigation into the circumstances of the deadly incident in Charlottesville, noting that they are collecting “all available facts and evidence.”

The chaos boiled over at what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade: the governor declared a state of emergency, police dressed in riot gear ordered people out and helicopters circled overhead. The group had gathered to protest plans to remove a statue of the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and others who arrived to protest the racism.

Virginia police arrested three others in relation to the unrest at the rally.

Troy Dunigan, 21, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct; Jacob L. Smith, 21, of Louisa, Virginia, was arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault and battery; and James M. O’Brien, 44, of Gainesville, Florida, was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed handgun.

Footage shows a vehicle appear to drive into a group of counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. Clashes between white nationalists and counter protesters had been ongoing on Aug. 12.

Matt Korbon, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, said counter-protesters were marching when ""suddenly there was just this tire screeching sound."" A silver sedan smashed into another car, then backed up, plowing through ""a sea of people.""

People scattered, running for safety in different directions, he said.

The incident happened about two hours after violent clashes broke out between the opposing groups.

Hundreds of people chanted, threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Over a dozen people were injured and one arrested in connection to the earlier violence, officials said.

Five patients were in critical condition Saturday evening, four in serious condition, six in fair condition and four in good condition, according to the University of Virginia Health System.

Adding to the chaos on Saturday, a helicopter that was assisting public safety resources with the rally in Charlottesville crashed and killed two Virginia state troopers later in the afternoon, Virginia police said.

The FAA is investigating the helicopter crash, and the National Transportation Safety Board will determine probable cause, NBC News reported. The pilot, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.

President Donald Trump, speaking Saturday afternoon from New Jersey where he has been on a working vacation, condemned the violence in Charlottesville, calling it an ""egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.""

""The hate and division must stop now,"" he said.

He did not respond to questions about whether he would denounce support from white nationalists.

A unnamed White House official clarified to NBC News about what the president meant by ""violence on many sides,"" saying that Trump was ""condemning hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides. There was violence between protesters and counter protesters today.""

The attorney general of Virginia fired back at Trump's comment, saying, ""the violence, chaos, and apparent loss of life in Charlottesville is not the fault of 'many sides.' It is racists and white supremacists.""

Before the car crash, Trump condemned the earlier clashes on Twitter, writing, ""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""

The president and his representatives have not yet acknowledged the death in the incident.

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia released a statement saying: ""We condemn the intolerance behind it and those who would pass it off as a legitimate political movement.""

First lady Melania Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan also took to social media to denounce the clashes between protesters and counter-protesters.

Small bands of protesters who showed up to express their opposition to the rally were seen marching around the city peacefully by midafternoon, chanting and waving flags. Helicopters circled overhead.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for what he termed a ""pro-white"" rally to protest the city of Charlottesville's decision to remove the confederate statue from a downtown park.

Colleen Cook, 26, stood on a curb shouting at the rally attendees to go home.

Cook, a teacher who attended the University of Virginia, said she sent her son, who is black, out of town for the weekend.

It's weird, but it works

""This isn't how he should have to grow up,"" she said.

Cliff Erickson leaned against a fence and took in the scene. He said he thinks removing the statue amounts to erasing history and said the ""counter-protesters are crazier than the alt-right.""

""Both sides are hoping for a confrontation,"" he said.

It was the latest confrontation in Charlottesville since the city about 100 miles outside of Washington, D.C., voted earlier this year to remove a statue of Lee.

In May, a torch-wielding group that included prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered around the statue for a nighttime protest, and in July, about 50 members of a North Carolina-based KKK group traveled there for a rally, where they were met by hundreds of counter-protesters.

Kessler said this week that the rally is partly about the removal of Confederate symbols but also about free speech and ""advocating for white people.""

""This is about an anti-white climate within the Western world and the need for white people to have advocacy like other groups do,"" he said in an interview.

Between rally attendees and counter-protesters, authorities were expecting as many as 6,000 people, Charlottesville police said this week.

Among those expected to attend were Confederate heritage groups, KKK members, militia groups and ""alt-right"" activists, who generally espouse a mix of racism, white nationalism and populism.

Both the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which track extremist groups, said the event had the potential to be the largest of its kind in at least a decade.

Officials had been preparing for the rally for months.

Police instituted road closures around downtown, and many businesses in the popular open-air shopping mall opted to close for the day.

Both local hospitals said they had taken precautions to prepare for an influx of patients and had extra staff on call.

There were also fights Friday night, when hundreds of white nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus carrying torches.

A university spokesman said one person was arrested and several people were injured.

Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer said he was disgusted that the white nationalists had come to his town and blamed President Donald Trump for inflaming racial prejudices with his campaign last year.

""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in American today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.""

""I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here,"" he wrote on Twitter later Saturday on Twitter. ""I urge all people of good will - go home.""



Charlottesville, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a liberal-leaning city that's home to the flagship University of Virginia and Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson.

The statue's removal is part of a broader city effort to change the way Charlottesville's history of race is told in public spaces. The city has also renamed Lee Park, where the statue stands, and Jackson Park, named for Confederate General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. They're now called Emancipation Park and Justice Park, respectively.

For now, the Lee statue remains. A group called the Monument Fund filed a lawsuit arguing that removing the statue would violate a state law governing war memorials. A judge has agreed to a temporary injunction that blocks the city from removing the statue for six months.","Authorities have charged a 20-year-old Ohio man for the deadly car ramming incident in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday, as the Department of Justice announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash.

(WSET) - Charlottesville's mayor confirms at least one person is dead after a car crashed into pedestrians in Charlottesville after the Unite the Right rally Saturday.



Charlottesville police Chief Al Thomas says a 32-year-old woman was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters on the Downtown Mall. The death is being investigated as a homicide.

Two people were killed aboard a state police helicopter that crashed on Old Farm Rd. in Charlottesville.

City officials now say the crash is linked to the rallies earlier in the day.

The identity of the woman killed in the car crash is being withheld until family can be notified.



According to the Associated Press, the driver was taken into custody.

Officials say the crash involved three vehicles and that several people were injured.

The hospital confirmed to the Associated Press that 19 people were injured.

City officials say 15 others were injured in the protests, but not when the car crashed.

This caused UVA Hospital to cancel all elective surgery, including those who have cancer.

“It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property,"" Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe said in a statement. "" I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours. The actions I have taken are intended to assist local government and restore public safety.

Police are asking people to avoid the area of Water and 4th Streets so medics can respond.



The Virginia National Guard was brought in to help police clear the area.

An unlawful assembly has since been declared and police are making arrests, authorities say.

In a tweet posted Saturday afternoon, state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick said that ""It is not enough that conservatives be a conquering army, we must be an army of occupation."" The tweet was signed ""DM,"" his initials.

But party officials told The Associated Press that McKissick didn't intend for the tweet to reference a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where three people were killed and dozens were sent to hospitals on Saturday.

The party officials tell AP that McKissick uses an app called Buffer, that sends tweets on his behalf, to keep his account appearing to be active on Twitter. Other tweets posted to his account on Saturday included articles on the United States' export of natural gas and a recent memo at Google claiming biological gender differences helped explain why women are underrepresented at the company. Those tweets linked to articles and were not signed by McKissick.

State Democrats jumped on McKissick's ""occupation"" missive, launching a tweet storm that began by saying he had sent his initial message on occupation ""in the face of terrorism."" A subsequent message said, ""This is not a time to use coded language to describe your love for segregation.""

Later Saturday afternoon, McKissick sent out a series of tweets blaming ""liberals trolling my Twitter feed"" for not recognizing the ""quote-bot when they see it.""

""And for the record, political violence by any group is always beyond the pale,"" McKissick ended the three-part tweet message.

In response to McKissick's later tweets, state Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson told AP he was saddened by the whole exchange.

""You can't fix dumbass,"" Robertson told AP. ""If he can't say something that fixes the situation, it's best that Drew McKissick just stay quiet.""

Republican party officials selected McKissick as chairman earlier this year. He has been a political operative in South Carolina for more than two decades.
