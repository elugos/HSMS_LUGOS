       "      <td>An inventor suspected of killing a journalist aboard his homemade submarine has once again changed his story. Danish engineer and inventor Peter Madsen has now admitted to dismembering Swedish journalist Kim Wall's body, police told the Guardian Monday. Madsen, however, still denies killing Wall.\\n\\nThough Madsen initially told authorities Wall died when a hatch fell on her head, he revised his story Monday. Now, Madsen claims Wall died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Madsen also admitted to spreading the dismembered body parts in Koge Bay off Copenhagen. Kim Wall—whose work appeared in Vice, the New York Times, and more—joined Madsen aboard the UC3 Nautilus in August to interview him for an article.\\n\\nWhen Wall did not return from the trip, her partner informed authorities and a search began. Mere hours later, Madsen \"intentionally\" caused the small submarine to sink. Weeks after a headless torso was found floating in Koge Bay and identified as Wall's, investigators recovered her head and legs. Multiple stab wounds were discovered on Wall's body. Divers are still actively searching for Wall's arms and smartphones belonging to Wall and Madsen, CNNreported Monday.\\n\\nLead investigator Jens Moeller Jense said Madsen's latest claims will \"of course\" result in police asking the medical examiner and submarine experts to provide additional statements.\\n\\nIn a Facebook post in August, Kim's mother Ingrid remembered her daughter as someone who made a difference in life. \"During the horrendous days since Kim disappeared, we have received countless examples of how loved and appreciated she was, as a person and as a friend, as well as a professional journalist,\" Ingrid wrote.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The study was small and used a surrogate endpoint, so the true value of hybrid revascularization won’t be known until a large-scale study is done.\\n\\nDENVER, CO—Hybrid revascularization, one that combines bypass grafting with PCI, fails to reduce myocardial ischemia and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events when compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery and PCI alone, according to the results of the small Hybrid Revascularization Versus Standards (HREVS) study.\\n\\nPresenting the results today at TCT 2017, lead investigator Roman Tarasov, MD (State Research Institute for Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases, Kemerovo, Russia), said they found “no evidence of benefit” with the hybrid revascularization approach, at least in the short term, for the treatment of patients with multivessel disease.\\n\\nFurther studies, including larger randomized trials, are needed to determine the clinical role of hybrid revascularization, he added.\\n\\nSuch trials are currently underway. The US National Institutes of Health-funded HYBRID trial, a 5-year study led by John Puskas, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), and Gregg Stone, MD (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY), is currently enrolling patients. In that study, more than 2,300 patients with multivessel disease will be randomized to the hybrid revascularization approach or PCI alone, although the results won’t be available for a few years.\\n\\nHREVS, which was presented during a First Reports session, included 155 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease considered by the multidisciplinary heart team to be candidates for CABG surgery, PCI, or hybrid revascularization.\\n\\nIn total, 50 patients were treated with CABG surgery, 53 with PCI, and 52 with the hybrid revascularization approach that included minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) followed by PCI 1 to 3 days after the procedure. Importantly, the hybrid technique included grafting the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and drug-eluting stents for the remaining vessels.\\n\\nRegarding the primary endpoint of residual myocardial ischemia assessed by SPECT at 12 months, which Tarasov said is an index of revascularization quality and a marker of long-term clinical outcomes, there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. The study was underpowered for clinical endpoints, but there were no statistically significant differences at 30 days. There was more bleeding in the CABG-treated patients, an unsurprising finding, said Tarasov.\\n\\nHolger Thiele, MD (Heart Center Leipzig, Germany), who was not involved in the study, told TCTMD hybrid revascularization is not frequently performed in Europe, noting there are limited data supporting its use. “It’s not common,” he said. “If you discuss a patient with the heart team, it’s usually black or white—we do surgery or we do PCI.”\\n\\nAn Idea Around for 20 Years\\n\\nChairing the morning press conference where the HREVS results were first presented, Roxana Mehran, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), said the potential utility of a hybrid revascularization approach has been discussed for more than 20 years.\\n\\n“We knew, before drug-eluting stents came around, that the best therapy to protect the patient is a LIMA to the LAD,” she said. “That’s what the surgeons told us. That’s why we always continue to think about repeat revascularization and worry about new lesions, especially in the LAD. We also know vein grafts don’t have the same durability. So the best of two worlds is a LIMA to the LAD and drug-eluting stents in the non-LAD distribution.”\\n\\nThat said, a hybrid approach is complex, as physicians must grapple with the appropriate antiplatelet regimen, as well as other logistical and procedural issues. Still, with the introduction of the heart team, there are discussions to provide the best care from both worlds—surgical and interventional—to patients, said Mehran.\\n\\nDavid Cohen, MD (Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO), one of the panelists discussing HREVS during the morning press conference, agreed with Mehran, stating that the approach has always made “conceptual sense.” He added that the benefits of the hybrid technique utilizing the LIMA to LAD are unlikely to emerge for some time after coronary revascularization.\\n\\n“It’s 10 years, 20 years,” said Cohen. “It’s going to take something on that order to really show the benefit of that approach.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>For months, Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, has been in crisis mode, furiously attempting to contain the damage stemming from its role in last year's presidential campaign. The company has mounted an all-out defence campaign before this week's congressional hearings on election interference in 2016, hiring three outside communications firms, taking out full-page newspaper ads, and mobilising top executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, to beat back accusations that it failed to prevent Russia from manipulating the outcome of the election.\\n\\nNo other predicament in Facebook's 13-year history has generated this kind of four-alarm response. But while the focus on Russia is understandable, Facebook has been much less vocal about the abuse of its services in other parts of the world, where the stakes can be much higher than an election.\\n\\nThis past week, my colleagues at The New York Times reported on the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims, an ethnic minority in Myanmar that has been subjected to brutal violence and mass displacement. Violence against the Rohingya has been fuelled, in part, by misinformation and anti-Rohingya propaganda spread on Facebook, which is used as a primary news source by many people in the country. Doctored photos and unfounded rumours have gone viral on Facebook, including many shared by official government and military accounts.\\n\\nThe information war in Myanmar illuminates a growing problem for Facebook. The company successfully connected the world to a constellation of real-time communication and broadcasting tools, then largely left it to deal with the consequences.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The timeline involving sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein is expanding. In a new report today, The New York Times detailed allegations by four additional women dating back to the 1970s.\\n\\nActress Hope Exiter D’Amore alleges that Weinstein raped her in a hotel room when he was a young concert promoter in the 1970s. D’Amore, who was in her 20s at the time and working for Harvey and Corky Productions, Weinstein’s concert promotion business in Buffalo, NY. When Weinstein learned that she had an interest in film, she was invited and agreed to come to New York City to meet with some people in the industry.\\n\\nWhen she arrived at the Park Lane Hotel with Weinstein, he told her there had been a mistake with the reservation and they’d have to share a room. She told the Times she thought it was “ridiculous” but ultimately agreed. She alleges he slid into bed next to her naked and forced himself on her after she pushed him away and said no.\\n\\nAfter the New York trip, she says, Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her gifts and credits, but she was fired a few weeks later.\\n\\nCynthia Burr claims she had an encounter with Weinstein when she was in her 20s, also in the 1970s when she was working as an actress in New York. She alleges that Weinstein tried to kiss her in an elevator, then unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway. She told the paper that the incident made her feel ashamed, but said: “What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.”\\n\\nBurr went on to appear in Scarface and the first two Lethal Weapon movies, as well as doing TV work.\\n\\nAdditionally, dancer Ashley Matthau, who performed in Puerto Rico in the Weinstein-produced Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, alleged that in 2004, Weinstein shoved her onto a bed and masturbated on top her. She eventually reached a legal settlement with him. And Lacey Dorn, then 22 and a young documentary filmmaker, recalled meeting Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party. She alleges that he grabbed and groped her as he said goodbye to her. She told the Times she never heard from Weinstein or spoke with him again.\\n\\nThe new allegations follow the Times’ exposé three weeks ago detailing numerous claims of sexual harassment and misconduct against the once-powerful Hollywood mogul. That report was followed days later by a New Yorker article that included many more allegations from other women.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Two detectives in the New York Police Department were charged with rape, kidnapping, and official misconduct Monday morning. In a 50-count indictment, the Brooklyn district attorney's office alleges detectives Edward Martins and Richard Hall, while working with an anti-drug squad in the Coney Island neighborhood on Sept. 15, pulled over an 18-year-old woman in her car, the New York Times reports. After searching the car and allegedly finding marijuana and a few Klonopin pills, the detectives handcuffed the woman and put her in their police van. Prosecutor Frank DeGaetano says Martins then forced the woman to perform oral sex on him and raped her while Hall watched through the rearview mirror. Hall then allegedly raped the woman. After the incident the woman had a rape kit conducted and DNA matched both detectives.\\n\\nMartins and Hall pleaded not guilty and were released on bail, and their attorneys called the woman's accusations \"uncorroborated\" and said the sexual encounter was consensual. Last week the New York Post obtained a letter from the detectives' lawyers to the Brooklyn DA's office attacking the woman's credibility by pointing out a \"provocative selfie\" she posted on Instagram and a recent tweet is which they say she brags about getting attention from \"paparazzi.\" But a spokesman for the DA's office attacked the letter, saying the \"defense counsel’s characterization of how a rape victim should behave is inaccurate, inappropriate and demeaning.” (More NYPD stories.)</td>\n",

       "      <td>One wonders whether these poseurs know anything at all about the man they've targeted. The 26th president gave us national parks, industrial regulation and environmental conservationism, among other things. He was also the author of over 40 books, some of which chronicle his expeditions and safaris that provided some of the basis for the natural history housed in the museum where he and his trusty steed keep vigil.\\n\\nThe New York vandalism, which isn't directly connected to the recent flurry of protests against Confederate statues, is merely the most recent episode in a protest that gained traction in 2016 by the same groups that also want to change Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day. What apparently triggered the freelance artists were two other figures -- an indigenous American and an African -- flanking Roosevelt's horse.\\n\\nThe jury is still out about what to do about the statue. Nothing would be a rational option, if a panel created by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio can handle some heat. Roosevelt may not be a civil rights icon like Rev. Martin Luther King, but he was hardly the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, either. Indeed, in 1905, Roosevelt gave a speech at the New York Republican Party Club that paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln and addressed racial inequality, which Roosevelt said he aimed to change. That this radical social transformation didn't occur within his time or tenure doesn't affirm in itself that he was racist.\\n\\nIn the speech, he did abysmally refer to whites as a \"forward race.\" But the focus of his address was to echo Lincoln in calling strongly for the raising of minorities' status, which Roosevelt correctly said would benefit the entire country.\\n\\nFirst, both men are walking in a proud, dignified manner, suggesting a parade in which the Rough Rider is accompanied by individuals who were part of his life experience. Second, we have to ask, what was the context of the time? Without the historical backdrop, criticism -- of politics, art or literature -- is meaningless.\\n\\nIn 1901, when this Harvard-educated, wealthy, progressive, worldly Republican New Yorker became president, was he enslaving Indians and blacks? No. Was he hunting extensively in the American West and later in Africa? Yes. Quite a lot. Given this record, is it not possible that the other two figures represent his guides or scouts on his American West hunts and African safaris?\\n\\nThe statue, created as a historical representation of the man and erected to honor his contributions to our knowledge of natural history, may be offensive to a few, but by what imperative are their feelings to be considered superior to the broader citizenry's right to not see public property harmed, defaced or splattered with paint -- or some facsimile thereof?\\n\\nMake an argument. Present facts. Bring passion but keep a cool head. One could argue, for example, that the protests against Confederate statues are substantively different from the objections to Roosevelt's monument. Given that most Civil War statues in the South were erected during the civil rights movement, inarguably, they memorialize not Southern courage but Jim Crow, a cowardly, despicable period of state-sponsored terrorism against blacks who had the audacity to insist upon equality under the law.\\n\\nConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, who hated the idea of memorials to the war, would likely be happy for his statues to settle in a statuary hall. As for Roosevelt, one only wishes the swashbuckling warrior-president could dismount for a few minutes and teach his vandals some manners. I'm guessing, but I suspect his two companions would lend him a hand.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Don't miss out on the headlines from Celebrities gone bad. Followed categories will be added to My News.\\n\\nAfter Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp claimed the movie star made sexual advances on him when he was 14 and Spacey was 26, it appears many industry insiders were aware of rumours about the star.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, well-known Boston journalist Heather Unruh tweeted: “The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me — #truth time. I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”\\n\\nIt took several days for her accusation to be picked up by news outlets, many of which did not publish her name or Spacey’s “for legal reasons”, although The Sun quoted an insider as saying: “Rumours about this actor have circulated for years ... Lots of people are making allegations after what’s happened with [Harvey] Weinstein.”\\n\\nUnruh was challenged on Twitter by some users, who said her accusations were “hearsay” and that it was unfair “to make an accusation without back-up.”\\n\\nBut the former news anchor replied: “This is 100% true … this person is considering all options about speaking out — not an easy decision.”\\n\\nShe later added: “My intent was to encourage a badly needed investigation and conversation. Plenty of information to be uncovered. #Investigate #It’sNotOk.”\\n\\nAnd it wasn’t just Unruh claiming the 58-year-old American Beauty actor was a sexual predator. In a protected tweet, a woman named Nadine West wrote: “KS groped my young male friend when they were both working at [London theatre] the Old Vic. Was apparently always known as one to avoid. Sadly unsurprised.”\\n\\nAnother commenter tweeted that she had heard similar stories from multiple sources, too.\\n\\nTop London theatre director Victoria Featherstone told BBC Radio 4’s Today that there had been “concerns” over Spacey for years. When asked whether she was aware of stories about Spacey when he was at the Old Vic, the Royal Court Theatre artistic director replied: “I think that many people in the theatre and in the creative industries have been aware of many stories of many people over a lot of years, and Kevin Spacey would be one of the people that people have had concerns about, yes.”\\n\\nSpacey admitted there were “stories out there about me” in his much-maligned apology to Rapp, in which he chose to come out as gay. Fans criticised his timing, saying that revealing the truth about his sexuality while saying sorry looked like a way to deflect attention from the younger actor’s accusation.\\n\\nIt appears the Usual Suspects star’s apology may have been an attempt to head off an even larger chorus of accusations from people who knew this open secret, just as they knew about producer Harvey Weinstein.\\n\\nRapp this week claimed in a Buzzfeed interview that in 1986, when he was a child actor in a Broadway show, Spacey invited him to a party at his Manhattan apartment.\\n\\nAs the only child there, Rapp said he spent most of the evening watching TV in a bedroom, until a drunk Spacey appeared in the room, picked him up “like a groom picks up the bride” and then lay down on top of him. “He was trying to seduce me,” said Rapp, now 46. “I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”\\n\\nRapp said he had found it hard to watch Spacey’s rise to fame, and was increasingly incredulous that anyone would do something like that to a 14-year-old boy.\\n\\nFollowing the House of Cards actor’s apology for his “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”, it has emerged that many other stars already knew about the rumours surrounding him. Rosie O’Donnell responded angrily to his claim that he could not remember what had happened with Rapp, writing: “u don't remember the incident — 30 years ago? — f*** u kevin — like Harvey we all knew about u — I hope more men come forward.”\\n\\nRose McGowan added: “Bye bye, Spacey goodbye, it’s your turn to cry, that’s why we’ve gotta say goodbye.”\\n\\nIn 2005, Seth MacFarlane — who made a pointed joke about Weinstein’s behaviour at the 2013 Oscars — referenced Spacey’s alleged sexual misconduct in an episode of Family Guy. Baby Stewie is seen running naked through a crowd shouting, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement! Help me!”\\n\\nNetflix confirmed to news.com.au it will not renew House of Cards, which is currently filming its sixth season. It comes after the streaming service released a statement saying it was “deeply troubled” by the allegations against Spacey.\\n\\nBut it’s understood the decision to cancel the show was made months ago and was not in response to the claims.\\n\\nWhile it’s not uncommon for a TV show to end after six years, House of Cards is seen as tentpole show for Netflix, primarily because it was its first.\\n\\nThe statement released by the service read: “In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”\\n\\nDespite the damage to his reputation, the passage of 31 years since the alleged incident involving Rapp protects Spacey from criminal prosecution or a civil suit under New York state law.\\n\\nAs we wait to see who will next comment on Spacey, the net is casting ever wider following Weinstein’s great fall, with victims standing up to powerful predators in Hollywood and across the world.\\n\\nThe New York Post speculated that the next “tipping point” would be the stars who still deny knowing anything, such as Matt Damon and George Clooney, who have pulled out of scheduled public appearances to promote their struggling movie Suburbicon.\\n\\n“Whom else does the industry know about and protect?” the editorial continued. “It’s hard to recall a time when the cultural landscape has shifted so dramatically. More than ever, the general public is inclined to believe self-reporting victims. More than ever, we are inclined to demand that the accused speak, that guilt be met with real consequence.”\\n\\nLeave a comment below, share your stories with emma.reynolds@news.com.au or tweet @emmareyn.\\n\\nOriginally published as Sordid rumours followed Kevin Spacey for years</td>\n",

       "      <td>An inventor suspected of killing a journalist aboard his homemade submarine has once again changed his story. Danish engineer and inventor Peter Madsen has now admitted to dismembering Swedish journalist Kim Wall's body, police told the Guardian Monday. Madsen, however, still denies killing Wall.\\n\\nThough Madsen initially told authorities Wall died when a hatch fell on her head, he revised his story Monday. Now, Madsen claims Wall died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Madsen also admitted to spreading the dismembered body parts in Koge Bay off Copenhagen. Kim Wall—whose work appeared in Vice, the New York Times, and more—joined Madsen aboard the UC3 Nautilus in August to interview him for an article.\\n\\nWhen Wall did not return from the trip, her partner informed authorities and a search began. Mere hours later, Madsen \"intentionally\" caused the small submarine to sink. Weeks after a headless torso was found floating in Koge Bay and identified as Wall's, investigators recovered her head and legs. Multiple stab wounds were discovered on Wall's body. Divers are still actively searching for Wall's arms and smartphones belonging to Wall and Madsen, CNNreported Monday.\\n\\nLead investigator Jens Moeller Jense said Madsen's latest claims will \"of course\" result in police asking the medical examiner and submarine experts to provide additional statements.\\n\\nIn a Facebook post in August, Kim's mother Ingrid remembered her daughter as someone who made a difference in life. \"During the horrendous days since Kim disappeared, we have received countless examples of how loved and appreciated she was, as a person and as a friend, as well as a professional journalist,\" Ingrid wrote.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The study was small and used a surrogate endpoint, so the true value of hybrid revascularization won’t be known until a large-scale study is done.\\n\\nDENVER, CO—Hybrid revascularization, one that combines bypass grafting with PCI, fails to reduce myocardial ischemia and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events when compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery and PCI alone, according to the results of the small Hybrid Revascularization Versus Standards (HREVS) study.\\n\\nPresenting the results today at TCT 2017, lead investigator Roman Tarasov, MD (State Research Institute for Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases, Kemerovo, Russia), said they found “no evidence of benefit” with the hybrid revascularization approach, at least in the short term, for the treatment of patients with multivessel disease.\\n\\nFurther studies, including larger randomized trials, are needed to determine the clinical role of hybrid revascularization, he added.\\n\\nSuch trials are currently underway. The US National Institutes of Health-funded HYBRID trial, a 5-year study led by John Puskas, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), and Gregg Stone, MD (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY), is currently enrolling patients. In that study, more than 2,300 patients with multivessel disease will be randomized to the hybrid revascularization approach or PCI alone, although the results won’t be available for a few years.\\n\\nHREVS, which was presented during a First Reports session, included 155 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease considered by the multidisciplinary heart team to be candidates for CABG surgery, PCI, or hybrid revascularization.\\n\\nIn total, 50 patients were treated with CABG surgery, 53 with PCI, and 52 with the hybrid revascularization approach that included minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) followed by PCI 1 to 3 days after the procedure. Importantly, the hybrid technique included grafting the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and drug-eluting stents for the remaining vessels.\\n\\nRegarding the primary endpoint of residual myocardial ischemia assessed by SPECT at 12 months, which Tarasov said is an index of revascularization quality and a marker of long-term clinical outcomes, there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. The study was underpowered for clinical endpoints, but there were no statistically significant differences at 30 days. There was more bleeding in the CABG-treated patients, an unsurprising finding, said Tarasov.\\n\\nHolger Thiele, MD (Heart Center Leipzig, Germany), who was not involved in the study, told TCTMD hybrid revascularization is not frequently performed in Europe, noting there are limited data supporting its use. “It’s not common,” he said. “If you discuss a patient with the heart team, it’s usually black or white—we do surgery or we do PCI.”\\n\\nAn Idea Around for 20 Years\\n\\nChairing the morning press conference where the HREVS results were first presented, Roxana Mehran, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), said the potential utility of a hybrid revascularization approach has been discussed for more than 20 years.\\n\\n“We knew, before drug-eluting stents came around, that the best therapy to protect the patient is a LIMA to the LAD,” she said. “That’s what the surgeons told us. That’s why we always continue to think about repeat revascularization and worry about new lesions, especially in the LAD. We also know vein grafts don’t have the same durability. So the best of two worlds is a LIMA to the LAD and drug-eluting stents in the non-LAD distribution.”\\n\\nThat said, a hybrid approach is complex, as physicians must grapple with the appropriate antiplatelet regimen, as well as other logistical and procedural issues. Still, with the introduction of the heart team, there are discussions to provide the best care from both worlds—surgical and interventional—to patients, said Mehran.\\n\\nDavid Cohen, MD (Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO), one of the panelists discussing HREVS during the morning press conference, agreed with Mehran, stating that the approach has always made “conceptual sense.” He added that the benefits of the hybrid technique utilizing the LIMA to LAD are unlikely to emerge for some time after coronary revascularization.\\n\\n“It’s 10 years, 20 years,” said Cohen. “It’s going to take something on that order to really show the benefit of that approach.”</td>\n",

Lots of people are making allegations after what’s happened with [Harvey] Weinstein.”\\n\\nUnruh was challenged on Twitter by some users, who said her accusations were “hearsay” and that it was unfair “to make an accusation without back-up.”\\n\\nBut the former news anchor replied: “This is 100% true … this person is considering all options about speaking out — not an easy decision.”\\n\\nShe later added: “My intent was to encourage a badly needed investigation and conversation. Plenty of information to be uncovered. #Investigate #It’sNotOk.”\\n\\nAnd it wasn’t just Unruh claiming the 58-year-old American Beauty actor was a sexual predator. In a protected tweet, a woman named Nadine West wrote: “KS groped my young male friend when they were both working at [London theatre] the Old Vic. Was apparently always known as one to avoid. Sadly unsurprised.”\\n\\nAnother commenter tweeted that she had heard similar stories from multiple sources, too.\\n\\nTop London theatre director Victoria Featherstone told BBC Radio 4’s Today that there had been “concerns” over Spacey for years. When asked whether she was aware of stories about Spacey when he was at the Old Vic, the Royal Court Theatre artistic director replied: “I think that many people in the theatre and in the creative industries have been aware of many stories of many people over a lot of years, and Kevin Spacey would be one of the people that people have had concerns about, yes.”\\n\\nSpacey admitted there were “stories out there about me” in his much-maligned apology to Rapp, in which he chose to come out as gay. Fans criticised his timing, saying that revealing the truth about his sexuality while saying sorry looked like a way to deflect attention from the younger actor’s accusation.\\n\\nIt appears the Usual Suspects star’s apology may have been an attempt to head off an even larger chorus of accusations from people who knew this open secret, just as they knew about producer Harvey Weinstein.\\n\\nRapp this week claimed in a Buzzfeed interview that in 1986, when he was a child actor in a Broadway show, Spacey invited him to a party at his Manhattan apartment.\\n\\nAs the only child there, Rapp said he spent most of the evening watching TV in a bedroom, until a drunk Spacey appeared in the room, picked him up “like a groom picks up the bride” and then lay down on top of him. “He was trying to seduce me,” said Rapp, now 46. “I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”\\n\\nRapp said he had found it hard to watch Spacey’s rise to fame, and was increasingly incredulous that anyone would do something like that to a 14-year-old boy.\\n\\nFollowing the House of Cards actor’s apology for his “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”, it has emerged that many other stars already knew about the rumours surrounding him. Rosie O’Donnell responded angrily to his claim that he could not remember what had happened with Rapp, writing: “u don't remember the incident — 30 years ago? — f*** u kevin — like Harvey we all knew about u — I hope more men come forward.”\\n\\nRose McGowan added: “Bye bye, Spacey goodbye, it’s your turn to cry, that’s why we’ve gotta say goodbye.”\\n\\nIn 2005, Seth MacFarlane — who made a pointed joke about Weinstein’s behaviour at the 2013 Oscars — referenced Spacey’s alleged sexual misconduct in an episode of Family Guy. Baby Stewie is seen running naked through a crowd shouting, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement! Help me!”\\n\\nNetflix confirmed to news.com.au it will not renew House of Cards, which is currently filming its sixth season. It comes after the streaming service released a statement saying it was “deeply troubled” by the allegations against Spacey.\\n\\nBut it’s understood the decision to cancel the show was made months ago and was not in response to the claims.\\n\\nWhile it’s not uncommon for a TV show to end after six years, House of Cards is seen as tentpole show for Netflix, primarily because it was its first.\\n\\nThe statement released by the service read: “In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”\\n\\nDespite the damage to his reputation, the passage of 31 years since the alleged incident involving Rapp protects Spacey from criminal prosecution or a civil suit under New York state law.\\n\\nAs we wait to see who will next comment on Spacey, the net is casting ever wider following Weinstein’s great fall, with victims standing up to powerful predators in Hollywood and across the world.\\n\\nThe New York Post speculated that the next “tipping point” would be the stars who still deny knowing anything, such as Matt Damon and George Clooney, who have pulled out of scheduled public appearances to promote their struggling movie Suburbicon.\\n\\n“Whom else does the industry know about and protect?” the editorial continued. “It’s hard to recall a time when the cultural landscape has shifted so dramatically. More than ever, the general public is inclined to believe self-reporting victims. More than ever, we are inclined to demand that the accused speak, that guilt be met with real consequence.”\\n\\nLeave a comment below, share your stories with emma.reynolds@news.com.au or tweet @emmareyn.\\n\\nOriginally published as Sordid rumours followed Kevin Spacey for years</td>\n",

Followed categories will be added to My News.\\n\\nLiberal backbencher Ann Sudmalis has hit back at “untrue” reports she was considering breaking ranks and voting against the federal government over the push to establish a royal commission into the banks.\\n\\n“A political stunt like that would not deliver results for the people that elected me, or for the people that have issues with banks,” Ms Sudmalis told News Corp Australia.\\n\\nLiberal MP Warren Entsch has also rejected reports he was considering crossing the floor but is standing by his warning to Treasurer Scott Morrison that “all hell will break loose” if historic allegations of misconduct by Australia’s banks are not investigated.\\n\\nMs Sudmalis said she would continue to work with Malcolm Turnbull and the government on her concerns about the banking sector.\\n\\n“I have done this successfully since being elected, and it’s my belief that this is the best way to get a resolution,” she said.\\n\\nMr Entsch and Ms Sudmalis were named by the ABC, along with Nationals MP George Christensen, as the three Coalition MPs who were considering a backbench revolt over their concerns about the banking sector.\\n\\nAny such move would only add to the chaos of the tumultuous final two weeks of Parliament Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull faces this year, which will include Barnaby Joyce’s by-election and a push to legislate same-sex marriage.\\n\\nMr Entsch told News Corp Australia today he had never mentioned “crossing the floor” to the ABC, and it was never raised with him.\\n\\nSpeaking from New York where he is on secondment to the United Nations, Mr Entsch said he had only mentioned “all hell will break loose” if Mr Morrison failed to look into historic claims of bad behaviour by the banks.\\n\\nHe said he had an assurance from Mr Morrison that he would look into the claims by Christmas and was confident the Treasurer would stand by his word.\\n\\nOne of the claims Mr Entsch wants investigated relates to a pensioner living in a retirement village who lost $1 million.\\n\\n“It’s important we deal with the historical case,” Mr Entsch said.\\n\\n“We have to make sure the victims of the past aren’t overlooked.”\\n\\nMr Christensen has previously threatened to cross the floor vote for the royal commission.\\n\\nA spokesman for Treasurer Scott Morrison told the ABC that both the Treasurer and the Revenue and Financial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer were still working on the matters Mr Entsch had raised.\\n\\nActing Prime Minister Julie Bishop told the program last night the government would work with the MPs whose constituents had concerns about the banks.\\n\\nBut she said a banking royal commission would not provide them with redress.\\n\\n“It would only make recommendations and that could be years away and that’s why we’re trying to take action now,” she said.\\n\\n“I’m sure my fellow members of Parliament understand that.”\\n\\nThe reports come as Mr Turnbull deals with the fallout from the High Court ruling on the “citizenship seven”, which saw Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and senator Fiona Nash disqualified from Parliament.\\n\\nMr Turnbull now faces the possibility of an embarrassing backbench revolt over the banking royal commission in the final sitting weeks of the year when, for at least a week, he won’t have a one-seat majority in the lower house due to Mr Joyce’s departure.\\n\\nIt’s also likely to coincide with an attempt to legislate same-sex marriage before Christmas — another powder keg issue set to reignite divisions in the Coalition.\\n\\nTrade Minister Steve Ciobo today questioned why his colleagues would threaten to cross the floor, given the government was already cracking down on bad bank behaviour.\\n\\n“What is the rationale for doing that? The simple fact is that as a government we’re taking concrete steps to do several things,” he told ABC radio.\\n\\n“One, we’re reinforcing the role that ASIC has in terms of being a judge in relation to corporate behaviour.\\n\\n“The second thing is we’ve implemented a whole range of new legislation including new accountability frameworks on the banking executives for the decisions that they take.”\\n\\nHe said Labor’s call for a royal commission was a stunt.\\n\\nOriginally published as Three Coalition MPs could cross floor to launch banking royal commission</td>\n",

       "      <td>Late Sunday, as a weekend of frenzied speculation and spin drew to an anxious close, #MuellerMonday began to trend on Twitter. A few hours later, a little more than two days after CNN broke the news that a grand jury had approved charges in special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation, the names were revealed.\\n\\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, who stayed on with the Trump team through the election and into 2017, will face charges including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, making false statements, and more.\\n\\nThe indictments, though, included no suggestion of election meddling. Manafort and Gates’ alleged crimes took place before they signed up with the candidate. President Donald Trump quickly logged on and began to gloat.\\n\\nBut there was more. It was also revealed that George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump, had pleaded guilty earlier this month to making a false statement to the FBI. His lie – or the truth beyond it – was potentially more damaging than anything to do with Manafort and Gates. Papadopoulos copped to misleading investigators about a conversation with a Russian “contact,” believed to have ties to Moscow, about “dirt” related to Hillary Clinton’s emails.\\n\\nBy noon on #MuellerMonday, the initial flurry of reactions and responses settled into four distinct camps – some hewing closer to reality than others.\\n\\nSenate Democrats and most of their colleagues in the House, in particular those tied to ongoing congressional investigations into the Trump campaign and Russia, mostly kept mum – careful not to further politicize the process and potentially give Trump a pretext for dismissing Mueller. Most Republicans were cautious too, clearly conscious of the President’s ire.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in a series of tweets, steered clear of the particulars.\\n\\n“The special counsel’s probe is ongoing in a serious way. The rule of law is paramount in America &amp; the investigation must proceed unimpeded,” Schumer began. “(Trump) must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way. If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues.”\\n\\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was also vague on Manafort, Gates and Papadopoulos. In a statement, she pushed for “an outside, fully independent investigation to expose Russia’s meddling in our election and the involvement of Trump officials.” Translation: a probe that can’t be called off, in the way Trump can fire Mueller, at the whim of the White House.\\n\\n“The President should let the special counsel do his job,” said Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, adding later in a statement that he didn’t have any more information on Mueller’s doings than what had been made public. (He too scurried away when pressed for more by reporters.)\\n\\nLiberal grassroots groups were also careful not to overplay the moment.\\n\\nMoveOn.org blasted an email to reporters trumpeting the “300+ events” being planned to launch in case Trump “interferes with the criminal investigation into his campaign and administration.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Indivisible co-executive director Ezra Levin urged his followers to keep their eyes on Capitol Hill: “Even on #ManafortMonday, we need to focus on where we have leverage. Right now, that’s the #TrumpTaxScam,” a reference to ongoing fight over the Republican tax plan.\\n\\nLiberal social media channels were less restrained. They have, in many cases, openly agitated for Trump’s impeachment or more aggressive action as it relates to Russia and the campaign. For them, the indictments – and the guilty plea on top of that – felt like a major step forward.\\n\\nRep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, was typically dramatic. He addressed a bunch of the big names in a series of Monday morning tweets.\\n\\n“Dear Paul Manafort &amp; Richard Gates: Here’s a fun fact for you. Federal prosecutors have a conviction rate of 93%,” he started off, linking to an early story about the indictments. “Thank you Special Counsel Mueller for draining the Swamp. #MAGA,” he posted a couple hours later. Lieu then tagged Trump in three more messages.\\n\\n“We the people must never tolerate our leaders’ collaboration with foreign adversaries against us,” Evan McMullin, the former presidential candidate and conservative favorite of the the liberal #resistance, tweeted at 8:41 a.m. ET. The grim declaration hinted at more serious allegations than could be found in any of the new court documents.\\n\\nA little after noon, he added: “Trump and his surrogates seem to confuse widely known and overt collusion with ‘no evidence’ of it. We’ve seen enough already.”\\n\\nFormer Obama Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller, another heavy presence on Twitter, suggested the potential for a direct, and much more recent, connection between the Papadopolous plea and Trump.\\n\\n“The FBI interview where Papadopolous lied about his Russia contacts came on the same day, Jan. 27, Trump asked Comey for a loyalty pledge,” he noted ominously. (There is nothing material, at this point, to suggest any connection between the two events.)\\n\\nHow, you ask, can one person make those two claims at once?\\n\\nTrump managed it in a pair of tweets.\\n\\n“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” he wrote in response to initial reports, adding: “But why aren’t Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems the focus?????”\\n\\nFox News and other conservative outlets loyal to the White House mostly kept in step with Trump throughout the early afternoon, focusing on what was not in the indictments and asking why Clinton had not come under more scrutiny. This is a familiar tactic for stoking the kind of partisan and tribal resentments that might blind segments of the public to the facts on the ground.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders pursued that line repeatedly during her afternoon briefing.\\n\\n“The real collusion scandal, as we’ve said several times before, has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,” she said, after dismissing the indictments as unrelated to Trump. “There’s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence the election.”\\n\\nConservative commentator Erick Erickson steered clear of the Clinton conspiracy theories and summed up the prevailing wisdom in more sober right-wing quarters.\\n\\n“Much of the political left is cheering about the indictment of Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort,” he wrote in a piece for FoxNews.com. “They think it will undermine President Trump. The problem, though, is that it appears increasingly likely that Manfort’s indictment has nothing to do with the Trump campaign.”\\n\\nFor Republicans who have either staked their careers or legislative agenda to Trump, there is simply no political upside – at least that they can see – in engaging with these issues.\\n\\n“Every morning, I wake up in my office and I scroll through Twitter to see which tweets I’ll have to pretend I didn’t see later on,” House Speaker Paul Ryan joked at the Al Smith Dinner in New York a couple weeks ago.\\n\\nOn Monday morning, he seemed to reprise that act, telling reporters in Wisconsin he hadn’t been paying close attention to the latest developments.\\n\\n“It is big news, but this is what you get from a special counsel – they made an indictment,” he said. “I really have nothing to add because I haven’t even read it, so I’m not going to speculate on something I haven’t read.”\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also steered clear of the Mueller drama. He spoke at a press conference on the Hill but ducked out rather than take questions from reporters.</td>\n",

The developments ushered Mueller's sprawling investigation into a new phase with felony charges and possible prison sentences for key members of the Trump team including Manafort, who led the campaign during critical months, and Rick Gates, a campaign aide.\\n\\nCourt papers also revealed that Papadopoulos was told about the Russians possessing \"dirt\" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" on April 26, 2016, well before it became public that the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails had been hacked.\\n\\nPapadopoulos has been cooperating with investigators, according to court papers, a potentially ominous sign for others in the Trump orbit who might be implicated by his statements.\\n\\nDuring the daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, saying it was \"extremely limited.\"\\n\\n\"He was not paid by the campaign,\" Sanders said, adding later: \"Any actions that he took would have been on his own.\"\\n\\nShe said the White House has had \"indications\" that Mueller's investigation would conclude \"soon.\"\\n\\nThe president quickly tweeted about the allegations against Manafort, saying the alleged crimes were \"years ago,\" and insisting there was \"NO COLLUSION\" between his campaign and Russia.\\n\\nHe added, as he has a number of times recently, \"Why aren't Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems the focus--?\"\\n\\nManafort and Gates appeared in federal court in Washington and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\\n\\nPapadopoulos' plea occurred on Oct. 5 and was unsealed Monday. In court papers, he admitted lying to FBI agents about the nature of his interactions with \"foreign nationals\" who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials.

The indictments also include other financial counts involving tens of millions of dollars routed through offshore accounts.\\n\\nManafort's indictment doesn't reference the Trump campaign or make any allegations about coordination between the Kremlin and the president's aides to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. The indictment does allege a criminal conspiracy was continuing through February of this year, after Trump had taken office.\\n\\nThe indictment filed in federal court in Washington accuses both Manafort and Gates of funneling payments through foreign companies and bank accounts as part of their political work in Ukraine. The two men surrendered to federal authorities Monday, and were expected in court later in the day to face the charges brought by Mueller's team.\\n\\nThe indictment lays out 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements and several charges related to failing to report foreign bank and financial accounts. The indictment alleges the men moved money through hidden bank accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Seychelles.\\n\\nIn total, more than $75 million flowed through the offshore accounts, according to the indictment. Manafort is accused of laundering more than $18 million.\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort did not immediately return calls or text messages requesting comment. Manafort and Gates have previously denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\nManafort, 68, was fired as Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The indictment against Manafort and Gates was largely based on activities disclosed in August 2016 by The Associated Press, which reported that the pair had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party.\\n\\nCiting internal emails, the AP noted that Gates personally directed the work of two prominent Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group. The indictment doesn't refer to the companies by name.\\n\\nSpecifically, the indictment accuses Manafort of using \"his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.\" That included using offshore accounts to purchase multimillion-dollar properties in the U.S., some of which the government is seeking to seize.\\n\\nMueller was appointed as special counsel in May to lead the Justice Department's investigation into whether the Kremlin worked with associates of the Trump campaign to tip the presidential election.\\n\\nThe appointment came one week after the firing of James Comey, who as FBI director led the investigation, and also followed the recusal months earlier of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the probe.\\n\\nManafort joined Trump's campaign in March 2016 and oversaw the Republican National Convention delegate strategy. Trump pushed him out in August amid a stream of negative headlines about Manafort's foreign consulting work.\\n\\nTrump's middle son, Eric Trump, said in an interview at the time that his father was concerned that questions about Manafort's past were taking attention away from the billionaire's presidential bid.\\n\\nManafort has been a subject of a longstanding FBI investigation into his dealings in Ukraine and work for the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. That investigation was incorporated into Mueller's broader probe. In July, his investigators raided one of Manafort's homes in Virginia, searching for tax and international banking records.\\n\\nPreviously, he denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it \"was totally open and appropriate.\"\\n\\nManafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgment that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law.

       "      <td>What Is Money Laundering? And Why Does It Matter To Robert Mueller?</td>\n",
       "      <td>When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced he was handing over the reins of the Justice Department's Russia investigation to a special counsel, he gave Robert Mueller the authority to look into \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\\n\\nIt has become clear in the time since that Mueller intends to use that clause to follow the money.\\n\\nThe former FBI director has assembled a team of lawyers, many of whom specialize in white collar law and financial crimes, leading to speculation that he is diving into the finances of those on the inner and outer orbit of the Trump campaign.\\n\\n\"They're looking for ties, they're looking for relationships, and a lot of that will come down to money trails,\" said Jennifer Rodgers, the executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to chargeable offenses Mueller could be zeroing in on, money laundering is at the top of the list.\\n\\nPop culture phenomena like Breaking Bad and Office Space have provided some education — but many people don't really know what money laundering is or how it works.\\n\\nHere's an explainer (jump to specific sections by clicking on the links below):\\n\\nPut simply: Money laundering turns \"dirty\" money \"clean\" — making proceeds from criminal activity usable without drawing the attention of law enforcement.\\n\\nJohn Cassara, a money laundering expert who worked for the State Department and the Department of Treasury for more than 25 years, says money launderers work through a three-step system.\\n\\n1. Placement: This is the first time that money acquired through a crime — stolen, say, or through drug or human trafficking — enters the financial system. The cash can be blended into a legitimate business' cash flow and receipts, or deposited in small amounts to banks for later transfer. This is where launderers are most vulnerable to being caught, says Cassara, as banks and financial institutions have a number of tools to try to catch suspicious activity.\\n\\nIntel, for instance, just announced new artificial intelligence software that monitors \"transactions and suggestive personality behaviors\" to catch would-be launderers, according to Axios.\\n\\n2. Layering: The second step is where a money launderer covers their tracks. By transferring the money between companies and accounts in different places, the goal here is to make it difficult for law enforcement to follow the trail because of jurisdictional issues and transparency laws.\\n\\nMany countries and even some states require very little personal information to start a company, leading bad actors to start what are called \"shell companies\" — companies without any purpose other than to be a disguising vehicle for money to change hands.\\n\\nBy the time someone is spending money in the United States, for example, it might have been transferred from Cyprus, having been transferred from Ukraine, having been transferred from, say, Russia, where it might have been stolen or received as payment in the drug or human trafficking trade.\\n\\n\"You can also layer it by switching it from cash to gold to cyber to commodities,\" Cassara said.\\n\\n3. Integration: Once the money has been moved, moved and moved again, it's time to legitimize it. Cassara says luxury items, property or stock investments are all options for a criminal to park the rewards of the ill-gotten gains.\\n\\nFor example, there are whole sections of the richest sections of London owned by wealthy foreigners that mostly sit empty, leading locals to wonder whether they're at the end of a pipeline of illicit money. Real estate in hot markets such as London or New York is a good investment for anyone because it seldom loses value and can often be quickly resold in legitimate transactions, freeing up cash. In the U.K., people call this phenomenon \"Lights Out London.\"\\n\\n\"Outside of crimes of passion, for example murder committed in a jealous rage, why do criminals and criminal organizations commit crime?\" Cassara asks rhetorically. \"Greed.\"\\n\\n\"Essentially, with any crime that generates money, the criminal needs to launder the money in order to use it,\" says Stefanie Ostfeld, the deputy head of the U.S. office for Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on exposing economic networks that breed corruption.\\n\\n\"The issue with money laundering is it tends to take two to money launder: You have the criminal who committed the original crime, but then you also have the bank, the lawyer, the accountant that actually moved the money into the financial system.\"\\n\\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that between 2 percent and 5 percent of global gross domestic product is laundered each year. Even if you take the lowest end of that guess, it's around $800 billion.\\n\\nOstfeld says the root of the problem is lax laws that make it easy to create businesses, or shell companies, with anonymous or hard-to-trace owners as part of the layering process.\\n\\n\"Time and time again, our investigations highlight the same problem,\" Ostfeld said. \"That's sham companies that allow those who steal state funds to move it undetected through the international financial system.\"\\n\\nPlaces like the island of Jersey and the Cayman Islands have reputations as shell company havens, but an article published earlier this year in The Atlantic found the U.S. to be \"perhaps the foremost shell-company provider globally.\"\\n\\nDelaware, for instance, is famous around the world for being an easy place to set up a shell company. In 2012, the state had more corporate entities than people, according to The New York Times. And as NPR reported, at least one entity linked with Russian advocates who want the U.S. to roll back sanctions on Moscow is chartered in Delaware.\\n\\nAre governments trying to crack down?\\n\\nOver the past 50 years, the U.S. has made policy changes toward curbing money laundering. Notably, Congress passed the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, which requires banks to report cash transactions over $10,000.\\n\\nIn 1986, the Money Laundering Control Act made money laundering a federal crime, and laws in the 1990s pushed financial institutions to begin filing reports on suspicious activity.\\n\\nStill, Cassara says despite the 18 million or so pieces of \"financial intelligence\" that will be filed in 2017, less than 1 percent of the money that is laundered will be recovered.\\n\\n\"To be a money launderer today, you'd have to be either very stupid or very unlucky to get caught,\" Cassara said. \"The magnitude is really high, but the sobering part is that our success rate is staggeringly low.\"\\n\\nOstfeld said that is because despite having tools at their disposal to quell the money's movement, law enforcement and banks have not made it a priority to do so.\\n\\n\"Bankers are doing the minimum they can get away with,\" Ostfeld said. \"What people don't really understand is that corruption doesn't just hurt people 'over there' ... It actually impacts so many aspects of life, we just don't see it because it's one piece of the puzzle.\\n\\n\"But then you take a step back and you realize it's actually what joins all these crimes together.\"\\n\\nWhy does it matter in the Robert Mueller investigation?\\n\\nIt's not a secret that Trump and those close to his campaign have had some financial ties to Russia.\\n\\n\"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets,\" as Donald Trump Jr. said at a real estate conference in 2008. \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"\\n\\nAnd it's also no secret that corruption in Russia means oligarchs there can't always keep money in Russian banks. They move it overseas, to Europe or the United Kingdom or the U.S., for use in buying real estate or other purposes. Often, they have help: One of the Russians who met with Trump Jr. in June 2016 in Trump Tower, Irakly Kaveladze, was said to have set up some 2,000 shell companies in the United States.\\n\\n\"Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties,\" wrote Craig Unger, in a long feature for The New Republic.\\n\\n\"Whatever his knowledge about the source of his wealth, the public record makes clear that Trump built his business empire in no small part with a lot of dirty money from a lot of dirty Russians.\"\\n\\nRodgers of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity says it may not be Trump who should necessarily worry about money laundering charges at this point. The president may have good reason to fear, according to some reports, but the person in the most pressing legal jeopardy could be Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\\n\\nMcClatchy reported in August that Mueller was \"zeroing in\" on Manafort's finances.\\n\\n\"I personally think they're looking at money laundering for Manafort,\" Rodgers said. \"It looks like they may get something there, given the sheer number of accounts he has, and the number of transactions involved.\"\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort declined to comment for this story. No one has been charged with any crime so far in the Russia imbroglio, and Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Russia.\\n\\nAll the same, observers including Rodgers say Mueller may try to use the threat of financial charges to flip Manafort into being a witness against others in the campaign.\\n\\n\"Anyone facing serious charges for money laundering and tax offenses involving undisclosed foreign bank accounts would have huge incentives to trade cooperation for prison time,\" Jonathan Winer, the State Department's top money laundering expert during the Clinton administration, told McClatchy.\\n\\nDetails about how deep Manafort's ties go continue to emerge.\\n\\nNBC reported recently on a $26 million loan between Manafort and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, making the pair's total financial relationship about $60 million over the past decade.\\n\\n\"Money launderers frequently will disguise payments as loans,\" Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor, told NBC. \"You can call it a loan, you can call it 'Mary Jane.' If there's no intent to repay it, then it's not really a loan. It's just a payment.\"\\n\\nWhile there aren't any charges yet, Mueller's prosecutors reportedly told Manafort in September that they plan at some point to indict him.\\n\\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

       "      <td>What Is Money Laundering? And Why Does It Matter To Robert Mueller?</td>\n",
       "      <td>When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced he was handing over the reins of the Justice Department's Russia investigation to a special counsel, he gave Robert Mueller the authority to look into \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\\n\\nIt has become clear in the time since that Mueller intends to use that clause to follow the money.\\n\\nThe former FBI director has assembled a team of lawyers, many of whom specialize in white collar law and financial crimes, leading to speculation that he is diving into the finances of those on the inner and outer orbit of the Trump campaign.\\n\\n\"They're looking for ties, they're looking for relationships, and a lot of that will come down to money trails,\" said Jennifer Rodgers, the executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to chargeable offenses Mueller could be zeroing in on, money laundering is at the top of the list.\\n\\nPop culture phenomena like Breaking Bad and Office Space have provided some education — but many people don't really know what money laundering is or how it works.\\n\\nHere's an explainer (jump to specific sections by clicking on the links below):\\n\\nPut simply: Money laundering turns \"dirty\" money \"clean\" — making proceeds from criminal activity usable without drawing the attention of law enforcement.\\n\\nJohn Cassara, a money laundering expert who worked for the State Department and the Department of Treasury for more than 25 years, says money launderers work through a three-step system.\\n\\n1. Placement: This is the first time that money acquired through a crime — stolen, say, or through drug or human trafficking — enters the financial system. The cash can be blended into a legitimate business' cash flow and receipts, or deposited in small amounts to banks for later transfer. This is where launderers are most vulnerable to being caught, says Cassara, as banks and financial institutions have a number of tools to try to catch suspicious activity.\\n\\nIntel, for instance, just announced new artificial intelligence software that monitors \"transactions and suggestive personality behaviors\" to catch would-be launderers, according to Axios.\\n\\n2. Layering: The second step is where a money launderer covers their tracks. By transferring the money between companies and accounts in different places, the goal here is to make it difficult for law enforcement to follow the trail because of jurisdictional issues and transparency laws.\\n\\nMany countries and even some states require very little personal information to start a company, leading bad actors to start what are called \"shell companies\" — companies without any purpose other than to be a disguising vehicle for money to change hands.\\n\\nBy the time someone is spending money in the United States, for example, it might have been transferred from Cyprus, having been transferred from Ukraine, having been transferred from, say, Russia, where it might have been stolen or received as payment in the drug or human trafficking trade.\\n\\n\"You can also layer it by switching it from cash to gold to cyber to commodities,\" Cassara said.\\n\\n3. Integration: Once the money has been moved, moved and moved again, it's time to legitimize it. Cassara says luxury items, property or stock investments are all options for a criminal to park the rewards of the ill-gotten gains.\\n\\nFor example, there are whole sections of the richest sections of London owned by wealthy foreigners that mostly sit empty, leading locals to wonder whether they're at the end of a pipeline of illicit money. Real estate in hot markets such as London or New York is a good investment for anyone because it seldom loses value and can often be quickly resold in legitimate transactions, freeing up cash. In the U.K., people call this phenomenon \"Lights Out London.\"\\n\\n\"Outside of crimes of passion, for example murder committed in a jealous rage, why do criminals and criminal organizations commit crime?\" Cassara asks rhetorically. \"Greed.\"\\n\\n\"Essentially, with any crime that generates money, the criminal needs to launder the money in order to use it,\" says Stefanie Ostfeld, the deputy head of the U.S. office for Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on exposing economic networks that breed corruption.\\n\\n\"The issue with money laundering is it tends to take two to money launder: You have the criminal who committed the original crime, but then you also have the bank, the lawyer, the accountant that actually moved the money into the financial system.\"\\n\\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that between 2 percent and 5 percent of global gross domestic product is laundered each year. Even if you take the lowest end of that guess, it's around $800 billion.\\n\\nOstfeld says the root of the problem is lax laws that make it easy to create businesses, or shell companies, with anonymous or hard-to-trace owners as part of the layering process.\\n\\n\"Time and time again, our investigations highlight the same problem,\" Ostfeld said. \"That's sham companies that allow those who steal state funds to move it undetected through the international financial system.\"\\n\\nPlaces like the island of Jersey and the Cayman Islands have reputations as shell company havens, but an article published earlier this year in The Atlantic found the U.S. to be \"perhaps the foremost shell-company provider globally.\"\\n\\nDelaware, for instance, is famous around the world for being an easy place to set up a shell company. In 2012, the state had more corporate entities than people, according to The New York Times. And as NPR reported, at least one entity linked with Russian advocates who want the U.S. to roll back sanctions on Moscow is chartered in Delaware.\\n\\nAre governments trying to crack down?\\n\\nOver the past 50 years, the U.S. has made policy changes toward curbing money laundering. Notably, Congress passed the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, which requires banks to report cash transactions over $10,000.\\n\\nIn 1986, the Money Laundering Control Act made money laundering a federal crime, and laws in the 1990s pushed financial institutions to begin filing reports on suspicious activity.\\n\\nStill, Cassara says despite the 18 million or so pieces of \"financial intelligence\" that will be filed in 2017, less than 1 percent of the money that is laundered will be recovered.\\n\\n\"To be a money launderer today, you'd have to be either very stupid or very unlucky to get caught,\" Cassara said. \"The magnitude is really high, but the sobering part is that our success rate is staggeringly low.\"\\n\\nOstfeld said that is because despite having tools at their disposal to quell the money's movement, law enforcement and banks have not made it a priority to do so.\\n\\n\"Bankers are doing the minimum they can get away with,\" Ostfeld said. \"What people don't really understand is that corruption doesn't just hurt people 'over there' ... It actually impacts so many aspects of life, we just don't see it because it's one piece of the puzzle.\\n\\n\"But then you take a step back and you realize it's actually what joins all these crimes together.\"\\n\\nWhy does it matter in the Robert Mueller investigation?\\n\\nIt's not a secret that Trump and those close to his campaign have had some financial ties to Russia.\\n\\n\"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets,\" as Donald Trump Jr. said at a real estate conference in 2008. \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"\\n\\nAnd it's also no secret that corruption in Russia means oligarchs there can't always keep money in Russian banks. They move it overseas, to Europe or the United Kingdom or the U.S., for use in buying real estate or other purposes. Often, they have help: One of the Russians who met with Trump Jr. in June 2016 in Trump Tower, Irakly Kaveladze, was said to have set up some 2,000 shell companies in the United States.\\n\\n\"Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties,\" wrote Craig Unger, in a long feature for The New Republic.\\n\\n\"Whatever his knowledge about the source of his wealth, the public record makes clear that Trump built his business empire in no small part with a lot of dirty money from a lot of dirty Russians.\"\\n\\nRodgers of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity says it may not be Trump who should necessarily worry about money laundering charges at this point. The president may have good reason to fear, according to some reports, but the person in the most pressing legal jeopardy could be Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\\n\\nMcClatchy reported in August that Mueller was \"zeroing in\" on Manafort's finances.\\n\\n\"I personally think they're looking at money laundering for Manafort,\" Rodgers said. \"It looks like they may get something there, given the sheer number of accounts he has, and the number of transactions involved.\"\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort declined to comment for this story. No one has been charged with any crime so far in the Russia imbroglio, and Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Russia.\\n\\nAll the same, observers including Rodgers say Mueller may try to use the threat of financial charges to flip Manafort into being a witness against others in the campaign.\\n\\n\"Anyone facing serious charges for money laundering and tax offenses involving undisclosed foreign bank accounts would have huge incentives to trade cooperation for prison time,\" Jonathan Winer, the State Department's top money laundering expert during the Clinton administration, told McClatchy.\\n\\nDetails about how deep Manafort's ties go continue to emerge.\\n\\nNBC reported recently on a $26 million loan between Manafort and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, making the pair's total financial relationship about $60 million over the past decade.\\n\\n\"Money launderers frequently will disguise payments as loans,\" Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor, told NBC. \"You can call it a loan, you can call it 'Mary Jane.' If there's no intent to repay it, then it's not really a loan. It's just a payment.\"\\n\\nWhile there aren't any charges yet, Mueller's prosecutors reportedly told Manafort in September that they plan at some point to indict him.\\n\\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

       "      <td>One wonders whether these poseurs know anything at all about the man they've targeted. The 26th president gave us national parks, industrial regulation and environmental conservationism, among other things. He was also the author of over 40 books, some of which chronicle his expeditions and safaris that provided some of the basis for the natural history housed in the museum where he and his trusty steed keep vigil.\\n\\nThe New York vandalism, which isn't directly connected to the recent flurry of protests against Confederate statues, is merely the most recent episode in a protest that gained traction in 2016 by the same groups that also want to change Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day. What apparently triggered the freelance artists were two other figures -- an indigenous American and an African -- flanking Roosevelt's horse.\\n\\nThe jury is still out about what to do about the statue. Nothing would be a rational option, if a panel created by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio can handle some heat. Roosevelt may not be a civil rights icon like Rev. Martin Luther King, but he was hardly the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, either. Indeed, in 1905, Roosevelt gave a speech at the New York Republican Party Club that paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln and addressed racial inequality, which Roosevelt said he aimed to change. That this radical social transformation didn't occur within his time or tenure doesn't affirm in itself that he was racist.\\n\\nIn the speech, he did abysmally refer to whites as a \"forward race.\" But the focus of his address was to echo Lincoln in calling strongly for the raising of minorities' status, which Roosevelt correctly said would benefit the entire country.\\n\\nFirst, both men are walking in a proud, dignified manner, suggesting a parade in which the Rough Rider is accompanied by individuals who were part of his life experience. Second, we have to ask, what was the context of the time? Without the historical backdrop, criticism -- of politics, art or literature -- is meaningless.\\n\\nIn 1901, when this Harvard-educated, wealthy, progressive, worldly Republican New Yorker became president, was he enslaving Indians and blacks? No. Was he hunting extensively in the American West and later in Africa? Yes. Quite a lot. Given this record, is it not possible that the other two figures represent his guides or scouts on his American West hunts and African safaris?\\n\\nThe statue, created as a historical representation of the man and erected to honor his contributions to our knowledge of natural history, may be offensive to a few, but by what imperative are their feelings to be considered superior to the broader citizenry's right to not see public property harmed, defaced or splattered with paint -- or some facsimile thereof?\\n\\nMake an argument. Present facts. Bring passion but keep a cool head. One could argue, for example, that the protests against Confederate statues are substantively different from the objections to Roosevelt's monument. Given that most Civil War statues in the South were erected during the civil rights movement, inarguably, they memorialize not Southern courage but Jim Crow, a cowardly, despicable period of state-sponsored terrorism against blacks who had the audacity to insist upon equality under the law.\\n\\nConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, who hated the idea of memorials to the war, would likely be happy for his statues to settle in a statuary hall. As for Roosevelt, one only wishes the swashbuckling warrior-president could dismount for a few minutes and teach his vandals some manners. I'm guessing, but I suspect his two companions would lend him a hand.</td>\n",

While Manafort has been known in the political world during his two months as campaign manager for President Donald Trump last year, Gates and Papadopoulos weren't the most well-known names until news of the Manafort-Gates indictment broke Monday morning. Paul ManafortManafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March of 2016, and by June, he became manager. However, two months later, Manafort resigned as campaign manager.

       "      <td>The study was small and used a surrogate endpoint, so the true value of hybrid revascularization won’t be known until a large-scale study is done.\\n\\nDENVER, CO—Hybrid revascularization, one that combines bypass grafting with PCI, fails to reduce myocardial ischemia and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events when compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery and PCI alone, according to the results of the small Hybrid Revascularization Versus Standards (HREVS) study.\\n\\nPresenting the results today at TCT 2017, lead investigator Roman Tarasov, MD (State Research Institute for Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases, Kemerovo, Russia), said they found “no evidence of benefit” with the hybrid revascularization approach, at least in the short term, for the treatment of patients with multivessel disease.\\n\\nFurther studies, including larger randomized trials, are needed to determine the clinical role of hybrid revascularization, he added.\\n\\nSuch trials are currently underway. The US National Institutes of Health-funded HYBRID trial, a 5-year study led by John Puskas, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), and Gregg Stone, MD (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY), is currently enrolling patients. In that study, more than 2,300 patients with multivessel disease will be randomized to the hybrid revascularization approach or PCI alone, although the results won’t be available for a few years.\\n\\nHREVS, which was presented during a First Reports session, included 155 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease considered by the multidisciplinary heart team to be candidates for CABG surgery, PCI, or hybrid revascularization.\\n\\nIn total, 50 patients were treated with CABG surgery, 53 with PCI, and 52 with the hybrid revascularization approach that included minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) followed by PCI 1 to 3 days after the procedure. Importantly, the hybrid technique included grafting the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and drug-eluting stents for the remaining vessels.\\n\\nRegarding the primary endpoint of residual myocardial ischemia assessed by SPECT at 12 months, which Tarasov said is an index of revascularization quality and a marker of long-term clinical outcomes, there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. The study was underpowered for clinical endpoints, but there were no statistically significant differences at 30 days. There was more bleeding in the CABG-treated patients, an unsurprising finding, said Tarasov.\\n\\nHolger Thiele, MD (Heart Center Leipzig, Germany), who was not involved in the study, told TCTMD hybrid revascularization is not frequently performed in Europe, noting there are limited data supporting its use. “It’s not common,” he said. “If you discuss a patient with the heart team, it’s usually black or white—we do surgery or we do PCI.”\\n\\nAn Idea Around for 20 Years\\n\\nChairing the morning press conference where the HREVS results were first presented, Roxana Mehran, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), said the potential utility of a hybrid revascularization approach has been discussed for more than 20 years.\\n\\n“We knew, before drug-eluting stents came around, that the best therapy to protect the patient is a LIMA to the LAD,” she said. “That’s what the surgeons told us. That’s why we always continue to think about repeat revascularization and worry about new lesions, especially in the LAD. We also know vein grafts don’t have the same durability. So the best of two worlds is a LIMA to the LAD and drug-eluting stents in the non-LAD distribution.”\\n\\nThat said, a hybrid approach is complex, as physicians must grapple with the appropriate antiplatelet regimen, as well as other logistical and procedural issues. Still, with the introduction of the heart team, there are discussions to provide the best care from both worlds—surgical and interventional—to patients, said Mehran.\\n\\nDavid Cohen, MD (Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO), one of the panelists discussing HREVS during the morning press conference, agreed with Mehran, stating that the approach has always made “conceptual sense.” He added that the benefits of the hybrid technique utilizing the LIMA to LAD are unlikely to emerge for some time after coronary revascularization.\\n\\n“It’s 10 years, 20 years,” said Cohen. “It’s going to take something on that order to really show the benefit of that approach.”</td>\n",

I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”\\n\\nIt took several days for her accusation to be picked up by news outlets, many of which did not publish her name or Spacey’s “for legal reasons”, although The Sun quoted an insider as saying: “Rumours about this actor have circulated for years ... Lots of people are making allegations after what’s happened with [Harvey] Weinstein.”\\n\\nUnruh was challenged on Twitter by some users, who said her accusations were “hearsay” and that it was unfair “to make an accusation without back-up.”\\n\\nBut the former news anchor replied: “This is 100% true … this person is considering all options about speaking out — not an easy decision.”\\n\\nShe later added: “My intent was to encourage a badly needed investigation and conversation. Plenty of information to be uncovered. #Investigate #It’sNotOk.”\\n\\nAnd it wasn’t just Unruh claiming the 58-year-old American Beauty actor was a sexual predator.

Followed categories will be added to My News.\\n\\nAfter Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp claimed the movie star made sexual advances on him when he was 14 and Spacey was 26, it appears many industry insiders were aware of rumours about the star.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, well-known Boston journalist Heather Unruh tweeted: “The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me — #truth time. I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”\\n\\nIt took several days for her accusation to be picked up by news outlets, many of which did not publish her name or Spacey’s “for legal reasons”, although The Sun quoted an insider as saying: “Rumours about this actor have circulated for years ... Lots of people are making allegations after what’s happened with [Harvey] Weinstein.”\\n\\nUnruh was challenged on Twitter by some users, who said her accusations were “hearsay” and that it was unfair “to make an accusation without back-up.”\\n\\nBut the former news anchor replied: “This is 100% true … this person is considering all options about speaking out — not an easy decision.”\\n\\nShe later added: “My intent was to encourage a badly needed investigation and conversation. Plenty of information to be uncovered. #Investigate #It’sNotOk.”\\n\\nAnd it wasn’t just Unruh claiming the 58-year-old American Beauty actor was a sexual predator. In a protected tweet, a woman named Nadine West wrote: “KS groped my young male friend when they were both working at [London theatre] the Old Vic. Was apparently always known as one to avoid.

       "      <td>The timeline involving sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein is expanding. In a new report today, The New York Times detailed allegations by four additional women dating back to the 1970s.\\n\\nActress Hope Exiter D’Amore alleges that Weinstein raped her in a hotel room when he was a young concert promoter in the 1970s. D’Amore, who was in her 20s at the time and working for Harvey and Corky Productions, Weinstein’s concert promotion business in Buffalo, NY. When Weinstein learned that she had an interest in film, she was invited and agreed to come to New York City to meet with some people in the industry.\\n\\nWhen she arrived at the Park Lane Hotel with Weinstein, he told her there had been a mistake with the reservation and they’d have to share a room. She told the Times she thought it was “ridiculous” but ultimately agreed. She alleges he slid into bed next to her naked and forced himself on her after she pushed him away and said no.\\n\\nAfter the New York trip, she says, Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her gifts and credits, but she was fired a few weeks later.\\n\\nCynthia Burr claims she had an encounter with Weinstein when she was in her 20s, also in the 1970s when she was working as an actress in New York. She alleges that Weinstein tried to kiss her in an elevator, then unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway. She told the paper that the incident made her feel ashamed, but said: “What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.”\\n\\nBurr went on to appear in Scarface and the first two Lethal Weapon movies, as well as doing TV work.\\n\\nAdditionally, dancer Ashley Matthau, who performed in Puerto Rico in the Weinstein-produced Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, alleged that in 2004, Weinstein shoved her onto a bed and masturbated on top her. She eventually reached a legal settlement with him. And Lacey Dorn, then 22 and a young documentary filmmaker, recalled meeting Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party. She alleges that he grabbed and groped her as he said goodbye to her. She told the Times she never heard from Weinstein or spoke with him again.\\n\\nThe new allegations follow the Times’ exposé three weeks ago detailing numerous claims of sexual harassment and misconduct against the once-powerful Hollywood mogul. That report was followed days later by a New Yorker article that included many more allegations from other women.</td>\n",

The developments ushered Mueller's sprawling investigation into a new phase with felony charges and possible prison sentences for key members of the Trump team including Manafort, who led the campaign during critical months, and Rick Gates, a campaign aide.\\n\\nCourt papers also revealed that Papadopoulos was told about the Russians possessing \"dirt\" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" on April 26, 2016, well before it became public that the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails had been hacked.\\n\\nPapadopoulos has been cooperating with investigators, according to court papers, a potentially ominous sign for others in the Trump orbit who might be implicated by his statements.\\n\\nDuring the daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, saying it was \"extremely limited.\"\\n\\n\"He was not paid by the campaign,\" Sanders said, adding later: \"Any actions that he took would have been on his own.\"\\n\\nShe said the White House has had \"indications\" that Mueller's investigation would conclude \"soon.\"\\n\\nThe president quickly tweeted about the allegations against Manafort, saying the alleged crimes were \"years ago,\" and insisting there was \"NO COLLUSION\" between his campaign and Russia.\\n\\nHe added, as he has a number of times recently, \"Why aren't Crooked Hillary &amp; the Dems the focus--?\"\\n\\nManafort and Gates appeared in federal court in Washington and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\\n\\nPapadopoulos' plea occurred on Oct. 5 and was unsealed Monday. In court papers, he admitted lying to FBI agents about the nature of his interactions with \"foreign nationals\" who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials. Those interactions included speaking with Russian intermediaries who were attempting to line up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and offering \"dirt\" on Clinton.\\n\\nThe court filings don't provide details on the emails or whom Papadopoulos may have told about the Russian government effort.\\n\\nThe FBI interviewed Papadopoulos about his Russian connections on Jan. 27, a week after Trump's inauguration. The interview predates Mueller's appointment but was part of the FBI probe into Russian election interference that he has taken over.\\n\\nPapadopoulos was arrested over the summer at Dulles International Airport and has since met with the government \"on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions.\"\\n\\nThe separate charges against Manafort and Rick Gates contend the men acted as unregistered foreign agents for Ukrainian interests. The indictments also include other financial counts involving tens of millions of dollars routed through offshore accounts.\\n\\nManafort's indictment doesn't reference the Trump campaign or make any allegations about coordination between the Kremlin and the president's aides to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. The indictment does allege a criminal conspiracy was continuing through February of this year, after Trump had taken office.\\n\\nThe indictment filed in federal court in Washington accuses both Manafort and Gates of funneling payments through foreign companies and bank accounts as part of their political work in Ukraine. The two men surrendered to federal authorities Monday, and were expected in court later in the day to face the charges brought by Mueller's team.\\n\\nThe indictment lays out 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements and several charges related to failing to report foreign bank and financial accounts. The indictment alleges the men moved money through hidden bank accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Seychelles.\\n\\nIn total, more than $75 million flowed through the offshore accounts, according to the indictment. Manafort is accused of laundering more than $18 million.\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort did not immediately return calls or text messages requesting comment. Manafort and Gates have previously denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\nManafort, 68, was fired as Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The indictment against Manafort and Gates was largely based on activities disclosed in August 2016 by The Associated Press, which reported that the pair had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party.\\n\\nCiting internal emails, the AP noted that Gates personally directed the work of two prominent Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group. The indictment doesn't refer to the companies by name.\\n\\nSpecifically, the indictment accuses Manafort of using \"his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.\" That included using offshore accounts to purchase multimillion-dollar properties in the U.S., some of which the government is seeking to seize.\\n\\nMueller was appointed as special counsel in May to lead the Justice Department's investigation into whether the Kremlin worked with associates of the Trump campaign to tip the presidential election.\\n\\nThe appointment came one week after the firing of James Comey, who as FBI director led the investigation, and also followed the recusal months earlier of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the probe.\\n\\nManafort joined Trump's campaign in March 2016 and oversaw the Republican National Convention delegate strategy. Trump pushed him out in August amid a stream of negative headlines about Manafort's foreign consulting work.\\n\\nTrump's middle son, Eric Trump, said in an interview at the time that his father was concerned that questions about Manafort's past were taking attention away from the billionaire's presidential bid.\\n\\nManafort has been a subject of a longstanding FBI investigation into his dealings in Ukraine and work for the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. That investigation was incorporated into Mueller's broader probe. In July, his investigators raided one of Manafort's homes in Virginia, searching for tax and international banking records.\\n\\nPreviously, he denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it \"was totally open and appropriate.\"\\n\\nManafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgment that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law. The indictment Monday accuses Manafort and Gates of making several false and misleading statements in that FARA filing.\\n\\nMueller's investigation has also reached into the White House, as he examines the circumstances of Comey's firing. Investigators have requested extensive documents and have interviewed multiple current and former officials.\\n\\nMueller's grand jury has also heard testimony about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York attended by a Russian lawyer as well as Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\\n\\nIn Gates, Mueller brings in not just Manafort's chief deputy, but a key player from Trump's campaign who survived Manafort's ouster last summer. As of two weeks ago, Gates was still working for Tom Barrack, a Trump confidant, helping with the closeout of the inauguration committee's campaign account.</td>\n",

But Gates was ousted from a pro-Trump advocacy group earlier this year amid mounting questions about Manafort. When Gates joined Manafort's lobbying firm in the mid-2000s, they worked for former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russia Party of Regions. Manafort's firm first came under scrutiny from US investigators in 2014, when they sought to determine whether his and other Washington-based lobbying firms failed to register as foreign agents for the Yanukovych regime. Gates has previously denied any wrongdoing. \"Everything was done legally and with the approval of our lawyers,\" Gates said in a June interview with The New York Times. \"Nothing to my knowledge was ever done inappropriately.\" Papadopoulos, a former policy adviser to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to making false statements to FBI agents. According to court documents, Papadopoulos allegedly made a \"false, fictitious and fraudulent\" statement about the timing and extent of his relationships with foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior officials in the Russian government. In recently unsealed court records, the FBI said Papadopoulos \"falsely described his interactions with a certain foreign contact who discussed 'dirt' related to emails\" concerning Hillary Clinton.\\n\\n Papadopoulos was an adviser to Ben Carson's presidential campaign, before he transitioned to the Trump team in May 2016.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ed. Note: This article is the latest in our series on the U.S. Supreme Court case Jesner v. Arab Bank, a case that is slated to resolve the question of whether corporations can be sued under international law for human rights violations and terrorism. Oral arguments were held October 11th.\\n\\nFurther to our previous coverage of the oral arguments (transcript is here) in Jesner v. Arab Bank (see Bill Dodge’s terrific contribution followed by Ed Swaine’s elaboration), below I summarize, Justice-by-Justice, some of the key issues raised by Supreme Court and the responses of the parties’ lawyers and the United States government as amicus curiae.\\n\\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor evinced a very sophisticated understanding of international law with her questions. She pushed former Solicitor General Paul Clement, representing the Arab Bank, hard on the question of whether or not it was necessary for plaintiffs to affirmatively demonstrate the existence of an international norm for holding corporations civilly liable for human rights abuses and terrorism. She turned the question on its head a bit when she asked if it was also necessary to demonstrate the existence of an international norm allowing for natural persons to be civilly liable, which is exactly what the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) accomplishes. Clement did not have a ready response and simply returned to the defendants’ common reframe that international law speaks to the question of who or what kind of actor can violate international law.\\n\\nTo Assistant Solicitor General Brian Fletcher, representing the United States on behalf of neither party, Justice Sotomayor asked about whether the United States should in fact be worried about the foreign policy implications of such suits, as defendants argue. Fletcher responded that the way to deal with any risk of foreign entanglement is through undertaking the extraterritoriality analysis called for by Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum. He also noted that there may be similar foreign policy implications for suits involving corporate officers and principals, which would presumably replace suits against the corporate entity itself if the Court rules for defendants in Jesner. So, limiting the ATS to suits against natural persons will not eliminate these concerns. To Clement, she queried whether any potential friction with the state of Jordan would be lessened by suits brought under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) as compared with suits under the ATS? Clement responded that under the ATS, the defendant is labeled a hostis humani generis—enemy of all mankind—a sobriquet that would be of greater concern than being considered a financière of terrorism.\\n\\nWhen Clement tried to point out that none of the international tribunals allows for corporate criminal liability, Justice Sotomayor stated the obvious: that criminal law is different from civil law. Invoking an amicus brief by comparative law scholars and practitioners, she noted that many nations hold corporations civilly liable for international law breaches under a range of mechanisms and theories of liability. Under her approach, the Court should look to this general state practice to determine what the applicable international norm is.\\n\\nChief Justice John Roberts wanted to know whether the ATS was a unique remedy internationally. This question gave plaintiffs’ counsel Jeff Fisher of Stanford Law an opportunity to explain the plaintiffs’ position, which is that international law contains substantive rules, but leaves many details of its enforcement to individual states based upon the particularities of their diverse legal cultures and frameworks. Fisher pointed to the comparative scholars brief for examples of the ways in which different domestic systems have dealt with corporate breaches of international law. He conceded that the ATS is a unique feature of U.S. federalism and reflects a desire of the founders to keep international law cases out of state courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction.\\n\\nTo the U.S. government, Chief Justice Roberts wanted to know who would hold the United States accountable if we did not provide a forum and a remedy for such cases. He asked: Isn’t it the case that other nations are actually annoyed that we are providing a remedy? Fletcher again indicated that any such concerns should be dealt with on remand when the parties can fully brief the extraterritoriality issue.\\n\\nJustice Samuel Alito focused in on the norm-identification process long established by Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, which requires courts to consider whether the plaintiff has alleged an established rule of international law. In what he described as step 2 of this analysis, this inquiry inevitably involves “an element of judgment about the practical consequences of making that cause available to litigants in the federal courts,” including the international repercussions of allowing the suit. Fisher agreed, but also pointed to a number of other doctrines available to deal with these contingencies, including extraterritoriality, foreign non-conveniens, political question, comity, etc. He argued that there is a mismatch between these concerns and the categorical rule of corporate immunity sought by defendants.\\n\\nJustice Alito was skeptical about whether or not denying an alien plaintiff a remedy for international law harms would itself have foreign policy implications. He queried whether there were other grounds to bring suit against U.S. corporations that breach international law, implying that United States does not need the ATS to carry out any remedial obligations under international law.\\n\\nThe application of the presumption against extraterritoriality came up several times during the argument, even though this issue is technically not before the Court and has not yet been fully briefed by parties. For example, Justice Alito asked whether the presumption against extraterritoriality would apply where there are transactions in the United States. Plaintiffs’ counsel insisted that this issue is not before the Court, but then explained that, in any case, such transactions are not a de minimis function; they are actually core to the international financial system as explained in the brief by experts on financial regulation. Mirroring the thrust of its brief, see Zach Kaufman’s coverage here, the government raised extraterritoriality in its opening and closing remarks, arguing that the categorical rule of corporate immunity relied upon by the Second Circuit in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum (Kiobel I) is the wrong one, but that the lower courts should look closely at whether the case sufficiently touches and concerns the United States to displace the presumption.\\n\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch was quite fixated on a 2011 law review article suggesting that the ATS was drafted in order to address situations in which the defendant hails from the United States (Bill Dodge has refuted these arguments here). The theory is that the founders wanted to avoid giving just cause for war against the United States. Putting aside the fact that nothing in the text of the Statute suggests this limitation, Fisher countered that what little history we do have on the ATS belies this theory. Rather, extensive historical research has confirmed that the 1784 Marbois-Longchamps affair, which involved two foreigners, inspired the ATS. In any case, Fisher noted that these issues were hashed out in Sosa and were definitively rejected, and all the recent cases before the Court involve aliens on both sides. At one point, Justice Sotomayor interjected to remind her colleague that the ATS clearly would have applied to piracy, which would not fit this revisionist paradigm or raise any foreign policy concerns. (So odd was this this line of questioning that one press account described it as “Gorsuch’s strange detour”).\\n\\nJustice Gorsuch suggested that cases involving ambassadors could be dealt with under the specific ambassadors clause of the Constitution. Or, they could be dealt with under federal question jurisdiction (§1331). Fisher noted, however, that one function of the ATS is to direct such cases to a federal forum.\\n\\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in connection with Justice Gorsuch’s line of questioning, reminded the participants that the Court has already held that international law is part of U.S. law. She asked the question of why international law would make a distinction between individual and corporate perpetrators? She observed that the major split within international law is between norms that require a showing of state action as an element of the offense (e.g., the conventional prohibition against torture, which requires a showing that the prohibited acts are “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity”) and those that apply equally (or predominantly as is the case with piracy) to private actors.\\n\\nShe was skeptical about whether the Court needed to find an affirmative rule addressed to corporations that would draw an artificial line between individuals and legal entities. She also opined that this is a question of remedy, which national law should supply. Clement tried to argue that there is in fact a big difference in how international law deals with natural persons vice corporate entities, citing the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) and the work of the international criminal tribunals since Nuremberg. Justice Ginsburg noted, however, that while international law may permit certain forms of redress, the U.S. Congress can decide not to extend liability to corporations, which it did in the TVPA.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg also invoked the Restatement, which recognizes corporate liability for international law violations. Clement responded that this text is not at the level of specificity required by Sosa. She noted that the United States had already sanctioned the Bank for its conduct. Clement responded that this is how these cases should be dealt with, not under the ATS.\\n\\nJustice Elena Kagan also pursued this line of argument and wanted to know if it would be better to deal with these cases through the creation and enforcement of financial regulations rather than through private litigation. Fisher noted that the allegations here are not about simple negligent oversight; rather, the Bank was affirmatively funding acts of terrorism against U.S. citizens and the citizens of our allies. These allegations were proven in the ATA wing of the case and resulted in a significant money damage award for the plaintiffs.\\n\\nJustice Kagan posed a weighty hypothetical: what about a United States corporation that is using alien slave labor under circumstances that pose no extraterritoriality concerns—should there be no liability under the ATS even though the law would normally provide a tort remedy for such corporate malfeasance? (This case is not a mere hypothetical, similar allegations arise in Doe v. Nestlé USA, which involves allegations that the company uses child slave labor to harvest cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire). Clement conceded that this is a difficult set of facts, but returned to the solution of simply suing the responsible corporate principals. When Justice Kagan raised concerns about judgment-proof defendants and noted that victims are more likely to get a meaningful remedy against the corporation itself, Clement argued rather lamely that (to paraphrase) “middle managers make good money.” When Justice Alito noted that the hypothetical would also give rise to potential felony liability, Justice Kagan retorted that victims would also be entitled to compensation, which would aide in their rehabilitation.\\n\\nJustice Kagan wanted to know when other governments might take offense if the United States did not provide a remedy. Fletcher noted that the “heartland” of situations to be addressed by the ATS involved foreign citizens injured by international law violations in the United States, like the Marbois incident. Justice Kagan questioned whether a foreign government that might take offense at the filing of a suit here would necessarily care whether that suit was brought against a natural person or a legal entity. In Fletcher’s estimation, to remove liability for a corporation and disallow an ordinary tort remedy that would otherwise exist might equally raise objections.\\n\\nIn this exchange, Justice Kagan raised an interesting issue that has not received a lot of attention: what should be the scope of corporate liability assuming there is no categorical bar? Would there be full respondent superior or would the corporation be amenable to suit only if there was a corporate policy involved? It was noted that Judge Posner in Flomo v. Firestone Natural Rubber Co. LLC would require a high level of accountability, in part to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality, similar to how the Court limited municipal liability in Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York. In response, Fletcher replied that all the Court needs to do is reject the categorical bar; it need not announce any particular standard at this time. On this line of argument, Clement pointed out that the 1999 Terrorist Financing Convention at Article V only require the imposition of liability on someone in a control or management position who violates Article II.\\n\\nTo Clement, Justice Kagan pointed out that a universal standard of conduct is needed under Sosa, not a universal enforcement mechanism. International law does not require states to enact a provision similar to the ATS, but nothing in international law would prohibit states from following suit. If allowing a case to proceed under the ATS might have foreign affairs consequences, this should be dealt during the Sosa analysis.\\n\\nJustice Anthony Kennedy stayed focused on the core question: does Sosa require plaintiffs to show that international law affirmatively recognizes a cause of action against corporations for international law violations? He insisted that this part of the conduct-regulating norm (as opposed to an ancillary or derivative inquiry addressed to modes of enforcement) since it would dictate standards of behavior to corporations. Fisher disagreed, indicating that the question of who could be sued and under what theory are elements of enforcement, but not core to identifying the scope of the norm itself. He took this occasion to remind the Court that this has been the consistent position of the U.S. government over two administrations.\\n\\nJustice Stephen Breyer reasoned that Sosa and the treaties address both persons and entities. He noted that the United States did sign the Terrorist Financing Convention and implemented it by passing the ATA. The Convention obliges states party to provide a remedy when legal entities located in their territories or organized under their laws fund terrorism, and that this obligation has been reinforced by the Security Council in Resolution 1373, passed just following the attacks of September 11th. Later, Clement pointed out that are 6 treaties that directly impose civil liability on corporate entities; these are listed in footnote 40 of Judge Cabranes’s Kiobel I opinion (e.g. the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage). The United States, however, has not ratified any of them. But, Justice Breyer noted, if there is a rule against financing terrorism, it must apply to corporations or it would have little impact other than with respect to a few depraved billionaires. Clement argued that plaintiffs bear the burden of showing the existence of an applicable norm and that the terrorism treaties do not provide such a norm. Even the Terrorist Financing Convention treats corporations separately and does not impose duties directly on them, but rather on states parties to the treaty. The United States, for example, limited the remedy under the ATA to U.S. citizens—this is entirely understandable in Clement’s mind, because we have a special relationship with our citizens.\\n\\nA couple of small issues also made cameo appearances. Justice Sotomayor asked about the Court’s new rules governing personal jurisdiction over corporations under Daimler Chrysler AG v. Bauman. Fisher noted that Daimler covers cases involving the exercise of general jurisdiction over corporations and requires them to be sued at the principal place of business or headquarters. The case at bar, by contrast, is a specific jurisdiction case involving actions taken in New York, the forum state.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg asked whether U.S. courts should impose or recognize an exhaustion of local remedies requirement as suggested in footnote 21 in Sosa. Plaintiff’s counsel explained that there was no viable alternative forum in Jordan. Plus, the ATS claims on behalf of alien plaintiffs proceeded in combination with ATA claims on behalf of U.S. citizens, so efficiency dictated that it made sense to bring the entire suit in one forum given the common nucleus of operative facts.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We are artists, arts administrators, assistants, curators, directors, editors, educators, gallerists, interns, scholars, students, writers, and more ― workers of the art world ― and we have been groped, undermined, harassed, infantilized, scorned, threatened, and intimidated by those in positions of power who control access to resources and opportunities. We have held our tongues, threatened by power wielded over us and promises of institutional access and career advancement. We are not surprised when curators offer exhibitions or support in exchange for sexual favors. We are not surprised when gallerists romanticize, minimize, and hide sexually abusive behavior by artists they represent. We are not surprised when a meeting with a collector or a potential patron becomes a sexual proposition. We are not surprised when we are retaliated against for not complying. We are not surprised when Knight Landesman gropes us in the art fair booth while promising he’ll help us with our career. Abuse of power comes as no surprise.\\n\\nThe letter was drafted following reports that former co-publisher of ArtForum magazine Knight Landesman has allegedly sexually harassed various women over the course of a decade, promising career advancement in exchange for their silence and acquiescence. Of course, Landesman is only one player in a competitive culture where powerful, white men ― whether artists, dealers, curators, publishers or collectors ― function as gatekeepers who can “make or break” the young and vulnerable.\\n\\nI’m sick of sitting through painful moments where an older man is outwardly commenting on my appearance or asking questions about my sexual preferences, putting his hand on my leg or lower back, and being told to laugh off revolting advances by someone who could be my grandfather, all because they are a “really good collector.” I’m sick of my artwork and my self being infantilized and sexualized during studio visits, dinners, at art fairs and openings, meanwhile male figurative artists are celebrated, revered and valued more than female artists, even if their content is completely sexual and misogynistic in nature. My main frustration is the insidious nature of these kinds of abuse, because so many men are able to look at these stories and feel as though they have nothing to do with it, because as far as they know, they’ve never physically abused a woman. The issue here is not solely physical sexual abuse or assault, but rather the subtle and constant way that women are consistently pushed down and made silent, in a manner that is so entrenched and normalized that it does not even register as an offense to most men. I hope that the more we come together to support each other and share stories and outline the problems, the more men will be able to pinpoint and identify their involvement and complacency, take accountability for their behaviors and make real change moving forward.\\n\\nMira Schor, also based in New York, reiterated a hope that the open letter will necessitate a shift in the industry. “I hope that it will help lead to positive changes in art world institutions and practices, particularly in empowering women to speak their mind and follow their intellectual and aesthetic passions and talents without unnecessary impediments caused by gender prejudice and either every day or unusually repellent sexual harassment or abuse,” she wrote.\\n\\n“Institutions might change if these women in the arts were raised to a bigger level of responsibility,” she said, “so that what they think is important, what they are aware of, what they bother to respect, might be given room at the top of the institution. I think this might help change the culture of these work places.”\\n\\n“I am hoping that some [institutions] will implement stronger policies to protect employees,” she said. “The bigger problem though is that the art world is for the most part an unregulated industry. Much of the business happens in social settings and one-on-one. It’s hard to control people’s behavior in those contexts. Powerful art dealers and independent superstar curators and millionaire artists are not subject to employee regulations the way one might be at a museum.\\n\\nThere is no single person or issue at the root of the sexual mistreatment that plagues the art world. Rather, a complex networks of power imbalance, wealth inequality, misogyny and lack of regulation make it so. An open letter won’t solve all the art world’s problems, but it can announce a new normal, where acts of discrimination, abuse and condescension will no longer be ignored.</td>\n",

    Dennis Banks, one of the founders of the American Indian Movement, died on Oct. 29 at the age of 80. Banks, a member of the Chippewa tribe who was born on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota, died of complications from pneumonia 10 days after undergoing open-heart surgery, the Star Tribune reports. He came to prominence in 1968, with the advent of the American Indian Movement, a political force that raised awareness about Native American issues through the use of marches and sit-ins and sometimes-violent confrontations with authorities. In its heyday the group occupied Alcatraz prison and took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, DC, for six days.\\n\\nBanks and his organization are perhaps most famous for their 1973 standoff with federal agents at the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre, the New York Times reports. On Feb. 27, 1973, 200 AIM followers and Oglala Lakota staged an armed occupation of the town of Wounded Knee, SD, and weathered a 10-week siege by US marshals and FBI agents. Two of the protestors were killed and one federal agent shot and paralyzed. Banks was charged with assault and conspiracy, but a federal judge dismissed the case, citing government misconduct. A Facebook message signed by his children and grandchildren said those present at Banks' death \"proudly sang him the AIM song as his final send off.\" (More Dennis banks stories.)   \n",

again changed his story. Danish engineer and inventor Peter Madsen has now admitted to dismembering Swedish journalist Kim Wall's body, police told the Guardian Monday. Madsen, however, still denies killing Wall.\\n\\nThough Madsen initially told authorities Wall died when a hatch fell on her head, he revised his story Monday. Now, Madsen claims Wall died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Madsen also admitted to spreading the dismembered body parts in Koge Bay off Copenhagen. Kim Wall—whose work appeared in Vice, the New York Times, and more—joined Madsen aboard the UC3 Nautilus in August to interview him for an article.\\n\\nWhen Wall did not return from the trip, her partner informed authorities and a search began. Mere hours later, Madsen \"intentionally\" caused the small submarine to sink. Weeks after a headless torso was found floating in Koge Bay and identified as Wall's, investigators recovered her head and legs. Multiple stab wounds were discovered on Wall's body. Divers are still actively searching for Wall's arms and smartphones belonging to Wall and Madsen, CNNreported Monday.\\n\\nLead investigator Jens Moeller Jense said Madsen's latest claims will \"of course\" result in police asking the medical examiner and submarine experts to provide additional statements.\\n\\nIn a Facebook post in August, Kim's mother Ingrid remembered her daughter as someone who made a difference in life. \"During the horrendous days since Kim disappeared, we have received countless examples of how loved and appreciated she was, as a person and as a friend, as well as a professional journalist,\" Ingrid wrote.   \n",

done.\\n\\nDENVER, CO—Hybrid revascularization, one that combines bypass grafting with PCI, fails to reduce myocardial ischemia and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events when compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery and PCI alone, according to the results of the small Hybrid Revascularization Versus Standards (HREVS) study.\\n\\nPresenting the results today at TCT 2017, lead investigator Roman Tarasov, MD (State Research Institute for Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases, Kemerovo, Russia), said they found “no evidence of benefit” with the hybrid revascularization approach, at least in the short term, for the treatment of patients with multivessel disease.\\n\\nFurther studies, including larger randomized trials, are needed to determine the clinical role of hybrid revascularization, he added.\\n\\nSuch trials are currently underway. The US National Institutes of Health-funded HYBRID trial, a 5-year study led by John Puskas, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), and Gregg Stone, MD (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY), is currently enrolling patients. In that study, more than 2,300 patients with multivessel disease will be randomized to the hybrid revascularization approach or PCI alone, although the results won’t be available for a few years.\\n\\nHREVS, which was presented during a First Reports session, included 155 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease considered by the multidisciplinary heart team to be candidates for CABG surgery, PCI, or hybrid revascularization.\\n\\nIn total, 50 patients were treated with CABG surgery, 53 with PCI, and 52 with the hybrid revascularization approach that included minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) followed by PCI 1 to 3 days after the procedure. Importantly, the hybrid technique included grafting the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and drug-eluting stents for the remaining vessels.\\n\\nRegarding the primary endpoint of residual myocardial ischemia assessed by SPECT at 12 months, which Tarasov said is an index of revascularization quality and a marker of long-term clinical outcomes, there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. The study was underpowered for clinical endpoints, but there were no statistically significant differences at 30 days. There was more bleeding in the CABG-treated patients, an unsurprising finding, said Tarasov.\\n\\nHolger Thiele, MD (Heart Center Leipzig, Germany), who was not involved in the study, told TCTMD hybrid revascularization is not frequently performed in Europe, noting there are limited data supporting its use. “It’s not common,” he said. “If you discuss a patient with the heart team, it’s usually black or white—we do surgery or we do PCI.”\\n\\nAn Idea Around for 20 Years\\n\\nChairing the morning press conference where the HREVS results were first presented, Roxana Mehran, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), said the potential utility of a hybrid revascularization approach has been discussed for more than 20 years.\\n\\n“We knew, before drug-eluting stents came around, that the best therapy to protect the patient is a LIMA to the LAD,” she said. “That’s what the surgeons told us. That’s why we always continue to think about repeat revascularization and worry about new lesions, especially in the LAD. We also know vein grafts don’t have the same durability. So the best of two worlds is a LIMA to the LAD and drug-eluting stents in the non-LAD distribution.”\\n\\nThat said, a hybrid approach is complex, as physicians must grapple with the appropriate antiplatelet regimen, as well as other logistical and procedural issues. Still, with the introduction of the heart team, there are discussions to provide the best care from both worlds—surgical and interventional—to patients, said Mehran.\\n\\nDavid Cohen, MD (Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO), one of the panelists discussing HREVS during the morning press conference, agreed with Mehran, stating that the approach has always made “conceptual sense.” He added that the benefits of the hybrid technique utilizing the LIMA to LAD are unlikely to emerge for some time after coronary revascularization.\\n\\n“It’s 10 years, 20 years,” said Cohen. “It’s going to take something on that order to really show the benefit of that approach.”   \n",

    Dennis Banks, one of the founders of the American Indian Movement, died on Oct. 29 at the age of 80. Banks, a member of the Chippewa tribe who was born on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota, died of complications from pneumonia 10 days after undergoing open-heart surgery, the Star Tribune reports. He came to prominence in 1968, with the advent of the American Indian Movement, a political force that raised awareness about Native American issues through the use of marches and sit-ins and sometimes-violent confrontations with authorities. In its heyday the group occupied Alcatraz prison and took over the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, DC, for six days.\\n\\nBanks and his organization are perhaps most famous for their 1973 standoff with federal agents at the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre, the New York Times reports. On Feb. 27, 1973, 200 AIM followers and Oglala Lakota staged an armed occupation of the town of Wounded Knee, SD, and weathered a 10-week siege by US marshals and FBI agents. Two of the protestors were killed and one federal agent shot and paralyzed. Banks was charged with assault and conspiracy, but a federal judge dismissed the case, citing government misconduct. A Facebook message signed by his children and grandchildren said those present at Banks' death \"proudly sang him the AIM song as his final send off.\" (More Dennis banks stories.)   \n",

California, has been in crisis mode, furiously attempting to contain the damage stemming from its role in last year's presidential campaign. The company has mounted an all-out defence campaign before this week's congressional hearings on election interference in 2016, hiring three outside communications firms, taking out full-page newspaper ads, and mobilising top executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, to beat back accusations that it failed to prevent Russia from manipulating the outcome of the election.\\n\\nNo other predicament in Facebook's 13-year history has generated this kind of four-alarm response. But while the focus on Russia is understandable, Facebook has been much less vocal about the abuse of its services in other parts of the world, where the stakes can be much higher than an election.\\n\\nThis past week, my colleagues at The New York Times reported on the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims, an ethnic minority in Myanmar that has been subjected to brutal violence and mass displacement. Violence against the Rohingya has been fuelled, in part, by misinformation and anti-Rohingya propaganda spread on Facebook, which is used as a primary news source by many people in the country. Doctored photos and unfounded rumours have gone viral on Facebook, including many shared by official government and military accounts.\\n\\nThe information war in Myanmar illuminates a growing problem for Facebook. The company successfully connected the world to a constellation of real-time communication and broadcasting tools, then largely left it to deal with the consequences.   \n",

California, has been in crisis mode, furiously attempting to contain the damage stemming from its role in last year's presidential campaign. The company has mounted an all-out defence campaign before this week's congressional hearings on election interference in 2016, hiring three outside communications firms, taking out full-page newspaper ads, and mobilising top executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, to beat back accusations that it failed to prevent Russia from manipulating the outcome of the election.\\n\\nNo other predicament in Facebook's 13-year history has generated this kind of four-alarm response. But while the focus on Russia is understandable, Facebook has been much less vocal about the abuse of its services in other parts of the world, where the stakes can be much higher than an election.\\n\\nThis past week, my colleagues at The New York Times reported on the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims, an ethnic minority in Myanmar that has been subjected to brutal violence and mass displacement. Violence against the Rohingya has been fuelled, in part, by misinformation and anti-Rohingya propaganda spread on Facebook, which is used as a primary news source by many people in the country. Doctored photos and unfounded rumours have gone viral on Facebook, including many shared by official government and military accounts.\\n\\nThe information war in Myanmar illuminates a growing problem for Facebook. The company successfully connected the world to a constellation of real-time communication and broadcasting tools, then largely left it to deal with the consequences.   \n",

Weinstein is expanding. In a new report today, The New York Times detailed allegations by four additional women dating back to the 1970s.\\n\\nActress Hope Exiter D’Amore alleges that Weinstein raped her in a hotel room when he was a young concert promoter in the 1970s. D’Amore, who was in her 20s at the time and working for Harvey and Corky Productions, Weinstein’s concert promotion business in Buffalo, NY. When Weinstein learned that she had an interest in film, she was invited and agreed to come to New York City to meet with some people in the industry.\\n\\nWhen she arrived at the Park Lane Hotel with Weinstein, he told her there had been a mistake with the reservation and they’d have to share a room. She told the Times she thought it was “ridiculous” but ultimately agreed. She alleges he slid into bed next to her naked and forced himself on her after she pushed him away and said no.\\n\\nAfter the New York trip, she says, Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her gifts and credits, but she was fired a few weeks later.\\n\\nCynthia Burr claims she had an encounter with Weinstein when she was in her 20s, also in the 1970s when she was working as an actress in New York. She alleges that Weinstein tried to kiss her in an elevator, then unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway. She told the paper that the incident made her feel ashamed, but said: “What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.”\\n\\nBurr went on to appear in Scarface and the first two Lethal Weapon movies, as well as doing TV work.\\n\\nAdditionally, dancer Ashley Matthau, who performed in Puerto Rico in the Weinstein-produced Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, alleged that in 2004, Weinstein shoved her onto a bed and masturbated on top her. She eventually reached a legal settlement with him. And Lacey Dorn, then 22 and a young documentary filmmaker, recalled meeting Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party. She alleges that he grabbed and groped her as he said goodbye to her. She told the Times she never heard from Weinstein or spoke with him again.\\n\\nThe new allegations follow the Times’ exposé three weeks ago detailing numerous claims of sexual harassment and misconduct against the once-powerful Hollywood mogul. That report was followed days later by a New Yorker article that included many more allegations from other women.   \n",

official misconduct Monday morning. In a 50-count indictment, the Brooklyn district attorney's office alleges detectives Edward Martins and Richard Hall, while working with an anti-drug squad in the Coney Island neighborhood on Sept. 15, pulled over an 18-year-old woman in her car, the New York Times reports. After searching the car and allegedly finding marijuana and a few Klonopin pills, the detectives handcuffed the woman and put her in their police van. Prosecutor Frank DeGaetano says Martins then forced the woman to perform oral sex on him and raped her while Hall watched through the rearview mirror. Hall then allegedly raped the woman. After the incident the woman had a rape kit conducted and DNA matched both detectives.\\n\\nMartins and Hall pleaded not guilty and were released on bail, and their attorneys called the woman's accusations \"uncorroborated\" and said the sexual encounter was consensual. Last week the New York Post obtained a letter from the detectives' lawyers to the Brooklyn DA's office attacking the woman's credibility by pointing out a \"provocative selfie\" she posted on Instagram and a recent tweet is which they say she brags about getting attention from \"paparazzi.\" But a spokesman for the DA's office attacked the letter, saying the \"defense counsel’s characterization of how a rape victim should behave is inaccurate, inappropriate and demeaning.” (More NYPD stories.)   \n",



                                                                                                                                                             One wonders whether these poseurs know anything at all about the man they've targeted. The 26th president gave us national parks, industrial regulation and environmental conservationism, among other things. He was also the author of over 40 books, some of which chronicle his expeditions and safaris that provided some of the basis for the natural history housed in the museum where he and his trusty steed keep vigil.\\n\\nThe New York vandalism, which isn't directly connected to the recent flurry of protests against Confederate statues, is merely the most recent episode in a protest that gained traction in 2016 by the same groups that also want to change Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day. What apparently triggered the freelance artists were two other figures -- an indigenous American and an African -- flanking Roosevelt's horse.\\n\\nThe jury is still out about what to do about the statue. Nothing would be a rational option, if a panel created by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio can handle some heat. Roosevelt may not be a civil rights icon like Rev. Martin Luther King, but he was hardly the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, either. Indeed, in 1905, Roosevelt gave a speech at the New York Republican Party Club that paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln and addressed racial inequality, which Roosevelt said he aimed to change. That this radical social transformation didn't occur within his time or tenure doesn't affirm in itself that he was racist.\\n\\nIn the speech, he did abysmally refer to whites as a \"forward race.\" But the focus of his address was to echo Lincoln in calling strongly for the raising of minorities' status, which Roosevelt correctly said would benefit the entire country.\\n\\nFirst, both men are walking in a proud, dignified manner, suggesting a parade in which the Rough Rider is accompanied by individuals who were part of his life experience. Second, we have to ask, what was the context of the time? Without the historical backdrop, criticism -- of politics, art or literature -- is meaningless.\\n\\nIn 1901, when this Harvard-educated, wealthy, progressive, worldly Republican New Yorker became president, was he enslaving Indians and blacks? No. Was he hunting extensively in the American West and later in Africa? Yes. Quite a lot. Given this record, is it not possible that the other two figures represent his guides or scouts on his American West hunts and African safaris?\\n\\nThe statue, created as a historical representation of the man and erected to honor his contributions to our knowledge of natural history, may be offensive to a few, but by what imperative are their feelings to be considered superior to the broader citizenry's right to not see public property harmed, defaced or splattered with paint -- or some facsimile thereof?\\n\\nMake an argument. Present facts. Bring passion but keep a cool head. One could argue, for example, that the protests against Confederate statues are substantively different from the objections to Roosevelt's monument. Given that most Civil War statues in the South were erected during the civil rights movement, inarguably, they memorialize not Southern courage but Jim Crow, a cowardly, despicable period of state-sponsored terrorism against blacks who had the audacity to insist upon equality under the law.\\n\\nConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, who hated the idea of memorials to the war, would likely be happy for his statues to settle in a statuary hall. As for Roosevelt, one only wishes the swashbuckling warrior-president could dismount for a few minutes and teach his vandals some manners. I'm guessing, but I suspect his two companions would lend him a hand.   \n",

Followed categories will be added to My News.\\n\\nAfter Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp claimed the movie star made sexual advances on him when he was 14 and Spacey was 26, it appears many industry insiders were aware of rumours about the star.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, well-known Boston journalist Heather Unruh tweeted: “The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me — #truth time. I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”\\n\\nIt took several days for her accusation to be picked up by news outlets, many of which did not publish her name or Spacey’s “for legal reasons”, although The Sun quoted an insider as saying: “Rumours about this actor have circulated for years ... Lots of people are making allegations after what’s happened with [Harvey] Weinstein.”\\n\\nUnruh was challenged on Twitter by some users, who said her accusations were “hearsay” and that it was unfair “to make an accusation without back-up.”\\n\\nBut the former news anchor replied: “This is 100% true … this person is considering all options about speaking out — not an easy decision.”\\n\\nShe later added: “My intent was to encourage a badly needed investigation and conversation. Plenty of information to be uncovered. #Investigate #It’sNotOk.”\\n\\nAnd it wasn’t just Unruh claiming the 58-year-old American Beauty actor was a sexual predator. In a protected tweet, a woman named Nadine West wrote: “KS groped my young male friend when they were both working at [London theatre] the Old Vic. Was apparently always known as one to avoid. Sadly unsurprised.”\\n\\nAnother commenter tweeted that she had heard similar stories from multiple sources, too.\\n\\nTop London theatre director Victoria Featherstone told BBC Radio 4’s Today that there had been “concerns” over Spacey for years. When asked whether she was aware of stories about Spacey when he was at the Old Vic, the Royal Court Theatre artistic director replied: “I think that many people in the theatre and in the creative industries have been aware of many stories of many people over a lot of years, and Kevin Spacey would be one of the people that people have had concerns about, yes.”\\n\\nSpacey admitted there were “stories out there about me” in his much-maligned apology to Rapp, in which he chose to come out as gay. Fans criticised his timing, saying that revealing the truth about his sexuality while saying sorry looked like a way to deflect attention from the younger actor’s accusation.\\n\\nIt appears the Usual Suspects star’s apology may have been an attempt to head off an even larger chorus of accusations from people who knew this open secret, just as they knew about producer Harvey Weinstein.\\n\\nRapp this week claimed in a Buzzfeed interview that in 1986, when he was a child actor in a Broadway show, Spacey invited him to a party at his Manhattan apartment.\\n\\nAs the only child there, Rapp said he spent most of the evening watching TV in a bedroom, until a drunk Spacey appeared in the room, picked him up “like a groom picks up the bride” and then lay down on top of him. “He was trying to seduce me,” said Rapp, now 46. “I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”\\n\\nRapp said he had found it hard to watch Spacey’s rise to fame, and was increasingly incredulous that anyone would do something like that to a 14-year-old boy.\\n\\nFollowing the House of Cards actor’s apology for his “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”, it has emerged that many other stars already knew about the rumours surrounding him. Rosie O’Donnell responded angrily to his claim that he could not remember what had happened with Rapp, writing: “u don't remember the incident — 30 years ago? — f*** u kevin — like Harvey we all knew about u — I hope more men come forward.”\\n\\nRose McGowan added: “Bye bye, Spacey goodbye, it’s your turn to cry, that’s why we’ve gotta say goodbye.”\\n\\nIn 2005, Seth MacFarlane — who made a pointed joke about Weinstein’s behaviour at the 2013 Oscars — referenced Spacey’s alleged sexual misconduct in an episode of Family Guy. Baby Stewie is seen running naked through a crowd shouting, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement! Help me!”\\n\\nNetflix confirmed to news.com.au it will not renew House of Cards, which is currently filming its sixth season. It comes after the streaming service released a statement saying it was “deeply troubled” by the allegations against Spacey.\\n\\nBut it’s understood the decision to cancel the show was made months ago and was not in response to the claims.\\n\\nWhile it’s not uncommon for a TV show to end after six years, House of Cards is seen as tentpole show for Netflix, primarily because it was its first.\\n\\nThe statement released by the service read: “In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”\\n\\nDespite the damage to his reputation, the passage of 31 years since the alleged incident involving Rapp protects Spacey from criminal prosecution or a civil suit under New York state law.\\n\\nAs we wait to see who will next comment on Spacey, the net is casting ever wider following Weinstein’s great fall, with victims standing up to powerful predators in Hollywood and across the world.\\n\\nThe New York Post speculated that the next “tipping point” would be the stars who still deny knowing anything, such as Matt Damon and George Clooney, who have pulled out of scheduled public appearances to promote their struggling movie Suburbicon.\\n\\n“Whom else does the industry know about and protect?” the editorial continued. “It’s hard to recall a time when the cultural landscape has shifted so dramatically. More than ever, the general public is inclined to believe self-reporting victims. More than ever, we are inclined to demand that the accused speak, that guilt be met with real consequence.”\\n\\nLeave a comment below, share your stories with emma.reynolds@news.com.au or tweet @emmareyn.\\n\\nOriginally published as Sordid rumours followed Kevin Spacey for years   \n",

again changed his story. Danish engineer and inventor Peter Madsen has now admitted to dismembering Swedish journalist Kim Wall's body, police told the Guardian Monday. Madsen, however, still denies killing Wall.\\n\\nThough Madsen initially told authorities Wall died when a hatch fell on her head, he revised his story Monday. Now, Madsen claims Wall died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Madsen also admitted to spreading the dismembered body parts in Koge Bay off Copenhagen. Kim Wall—whose work appeared in Vice, the New York Times, and more—joined Madsen aboard the UC3 Nautilus in August to interview him for an article.\\n\\nWhen Wall did not return from the trip, her partner informed authorities and a search began. Mere hours later, Madsen \"intentionally\" caused the small submarine to sink. Weeks after a headless torso was found floating in Koge Bay and identified as Wall's, investigators recovered her head and legs. Multiple stab wounds were discovered on Wall's body. Divers are still actively searching for Wall's arms and smartphones belonging to Wall and Madsen, CNNreported Monday.\\n\\nLead investigator Jens Moeller Jense said Madsen's latest claims will \"of course\" result in police asking the medical examiner and submarine experts to provide additional statements.\\n\\nIn a Facebook post in August, Kim's mother Ingrid remembered her daughter as someone who made a difference in life. \"During the horrendous days since Kim disappeared, we have received countless examples of how loved and appreciated she was, as a person and as a friend, as well as a professional journalist,\" Ingrid wrote.   \n",

                                                       The study was small and used a surrogate endpoint, so the true value of hybrid revascularization won’t be known until a large-scale study is done.\\n\\nDENVER, CO—Hybrid revascularization, one that combines bypass grafting with PCI, fails to reduce myocardial ischemia and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events when compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery and PCI alone, according to the results of the small Hybrid Revascularization Versus Standards (HREVS) study.\\n\\nPresenting the results today at TCT 2017, lead investigator Roman Tarasov, MD (State Research Institute for Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases, Kemerovo, Russia), said they found “no evidence of benefit” with the hybrid revascularization approach, at least in the short term, for the treatment of patients with multivessel disease.\\n\\nFurther studies, including larger randomized trials, are needed to determine the clinical role of hybrid revascularization, he added.\\n\\nSuch trials are currently underway. The US National Institutes of Health-funded HYBRID trial, a 5-year study led by John Puskas, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), and Gregg Stone, MD (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY), is currently enrolling patients. In that study, more than 2,300 patients with multivessel disease will be randomized to the hybrid revascularization approach or PCI alone, although the results won’t be available for a few years.\\n\\nHREVS, which was presented during a First Reports session, included 155 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease considered by the multidisciplinary heart team to be candidates for CABG surgery, PCI, or hybrid revascularization.\\n\\nIn total, 50 patients were treated with CABG surgery, 53 with PCI, and 52 with the hybrid revascularization approach that included minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) followed by PCI 1 to 3 days after the procedure. Importantly, the hybrid technique included grafting the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and drug-eluting stents for the remaining vessels.\\n\\nRegarding the primary endpoint of residual myocardial ischemia assessed by SPECT at 12 months, which Tarasov said is an index of revascularization quality and a marker of long-term clinical outcomes, there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. The study was underpowered for clinical endpoints, but there were no statistically significant differences at 30 days. There was more bleeding in the CABG-treated patients, an unsurprising finding, said Tarasov.\\n\\nHolger Thiele, MD (Heart Center Leipzig, Germany), who was not involved in the study, told TCTMD hybrid revascularization is not frequently performed in Europe, noting there are limited data supporting its use. “It’s not common,” he said. “If you discuss a patient with the heart team, it’s usually black or white—we do surgery or we do PCI.”\\n\\nAn Idea Around for 20 Years\\n\\nChairing the morning press conference where the HREVS results were first presented, Roxana Mehran, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), said the potential utility of a hybrid revascularization approach has been discussed for more than 20 years.\\n\\n“We knew, before drug-eluting stents came around, that the best therapy to protect the patient is a LIMA to the LAD,” she said. “That’s what the surgeons told us. That’s why we always continue to think about repeat revascularization and worry about new lesions, especially in the LAD. We also know vein grafts don’t have the same durability. So the best of two worlds is a LIMA to the LAD and drug-eluting stents in the non-LAD distribution.”\\n\\nThat said, a hybrid approach is complex, as physicians must grapple with the appropriate antiplatelet regimen, as well as other logistical and procedural issues. Still, with the introduction of the heart team, there are discussions to provide the best care from both worlds—surgical and interventional—to patients, said Mehran.\\n\\nDavid Cohen, MD (Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO), one of the panelists discussing HREVS during the morning press conference, agreed with Mehran, stating that the approach has always made “conceptual sense.” He added that the benefits of the hybrid technique utilizing the LIMA to LAD are unlikely to emerge for some time after coronary revascularization.\\n\\n“It’s 10 years, 20 years,” said Cohen. “It’s going to take something on that order to really show the benefit of that approach.”   \n",

Trump associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and the guilty plea from former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, have brought the three men into the national spotlight. While Manafort has been known in the political world during his two months as campaign manager for President Donald Trump last year, Gates and Papadopoulos weren't the most well-known names until news of the Manafort-Gates indictment broke Monday morning. Paul ManafortManafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March of 2016, and by June, he became manager. However, two months later, Manafort resigned as campaign manager. Manafort and Gates, longtime business associates who served together on the Trump campaign, were the first two officials indicted Monday in connection with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, on 12 counts that included conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money and unregistered agent of a foreign principal.The charges do not cover any activities related to the campaign, though it's possible Mueller could add additional charges.Rick GatesGates served as Manafort's deputy during his tenure as Trump campaign manager. Gates stayed on the campaign after Manafort was ousted amid questions about his work in Ukraine. But Gates was ousted from a pro-Trump advocacy group earlier this year amid mounting questions about Manafort.When Gates joined Manafort's lobbying firm in the mid-2000s, they worked for former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russia Party of Regions.Manafort's firm first came under scrutiny from US investigators in 2014, when they sought to determine whether his and other Washington-based lobbying firms failed to register as foreign agents for the Yanukovych regime.Gates has previously denied any wrongdoing. \"Everything was done legally and with the approval of our lawyers,\" Gates said in a June interview with The New York Times. \"Nothing to my knowledge was ever done inappropriately.\"George PapadopoulosPapadopoulos, a former policy adviser to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to making false statements to FBI agents. According to court documents, Papadopoulos allegedly made a \"false, fictitious and fraudulent\" statement about the timing and extent of his relationships with foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior officials in the Russian government.In recently unsealed court records, the FBI said Papadopoulos \"falsely described his interactions with a certain foreign contact who discussed 'dirt' related to emails\" concerning Hillary Clinton.Papadopoulos was an adviser to Ben Carson's presidential campaign, before he transitioned to the Trump team in May 2016.CNN contributed to this report.\\n\\nThe indictments against former Trump associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and the guilty plea from former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, have brought the three men into the national spotlight.

Manafort's firm first came under scrutiny from US investigators in 2014, when they sought to determine whether his and other Washington-based lobbying firms failed to register as foreign agents for the Yanukovych regime. Gates has previously denied any wrongdoing. \"Everything was done legally and with the approval of our lawyers,\" Gates said in a June interview with The New York Times. \"Nothing to my knowledge was ever done inappropriately.\" Papadopoulos, a former policy adviser to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to making false statements to FBI agents. According to court documents, Papadopoulos allegedly made a \"false, fictitious and fraudulent\" statement about the timing and extent of his relationships with foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior officials in the Russian government. In recently unsealed court records, the FBI said Papadopoulos \"falsely described his interactions with a certain foreign contact who discussed 'dirt' related to emails\" concerning Hillary Clinton.\\n\\n Papadopoulos was an adviser to Ben Carson's presidential campaign, before he transitioned to the Trump team in May 2016.   \n",

Followed categories will be added to My News.\\n\\nAfter Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp claimed the movie star made sexual advances on him when he was 14 and Spacey was 26, it appears many industry insiders were aware of rumours about the star.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, well-known Boston journalist Heather Unruh tweeted: “The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me — #truth time. I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”\\n\\nIt took several days for her accusation to be picked up by news outlets, many of which did not publish her name or Spacey’s “for legal reasons”, although The Sun quoted an insider as saying: “Rumours about this actor have circulated for years ... Lots of people are making allegations after what’s happened with [Harvey] Weinstein.”\\n\\nUnruh was challenged on Twitter by some users, who said her accusations were “hearsay” and that it was unfair “to make an accusation without back-up.”\\n\\nBut the former news anchor replied: “This is 100% true … this person is considering all options about speaking out — not an easy decision.”\\n\\nShe later added: “My intent was to encourage a badly needed investigation and conversation. Plenty of information to be uncovered. #Investigate #It’sNotOk.”\\n\\nAnd it wasn’t just Unruh claiming the 58-year-old American Beauty actor was a sexual predator. In a protected tweet, a woman named Nadine West wrote: “KS groped my young male friend when they were both working at [London theatre] the Old Vic. Was apparently always known as one to avoid. Sadly unsurprised.”\\n\\nAnother commenter tweeted that she had heard similar stories from multiple sources, too.\\n\\nTop London theatre director Victoria Featherstone told BBC Radio 4’s Today that there had been “concerns” over Spacey for years. When asked whether she was aware of stories about Spacey when he was at the Old Vic, the Royal Court Theatre artistic director replied: “I think that many people in the theatre and in the creative industries have been aware of many stories of many people over a lot of years, and Kevin Spacey would be one of the people that people have had concerns about, yes.”\\n\\nSpacey admitted there were “stories out there about me” in his much-maligned apology to Rapp, in which he chose to come out as gay. Fans criticised his timing, saying that revealing the truth about his sexuality while saying sorry looked like a way to deflect attention from the younger actor’s accusation.\\n\\nIt appears the Usual Suspects star’s apology may have been an attempt to head off an even larger chorus of accusations from people who knew this open secret, just as they knew about producer Harvey Weinstein.\\n\\nRapp this week claimed in a Buzzfeed interview that in 1986, when he was a child actor in a Broadway show, Spacey invited him to a party at his Manhattan apartment.\\n\\nAs the only child there, Rapp said he spent most of the evening watching TV in a bedroom, until a drunk Spacey appeared in the room, picked him up “like a groom picks up the bride” and then lay down on top of him. “He was trying to seduce me,” said Rapp, now 46. “I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”\\n\\nRapp said he had found it hard to watch Spacey’s rise to fame, and was increasingly incredulous that anyone would do something like that to a 14-year-old boy.\\n\\nFollowing the House of Cards actor’s apology for his “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”, it has emerged that many other stars already knew about the rumours surrounding him. Rosie O’Donnell responded angrily to his claim that he could not remember what had happened with Rapp, writing: “u don't remember the incident — 30 years ago? — f*** u kevin — like Harvey we all knew about u — I hope more men come forward.”\\n\\nRose McGowan added: “Bye bye, Spacey goodbye, it’s your turn to cry, that’s why we’ve gotta say goodbye.”\\n\\nIn 2005, Seth MacFarlane — who made a pointed joke about Weinstein’s behaviour at the 2013 Oscars — referenced Spacey’s alleged sexual misconduct in an episode of Family Guy. Baby Stewie is seen running naked through a crowd shouting, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement! Help me!”\\n\\nNetflix confirmed to news.com.au it will not renew House of Cards, which is currently filming its sixth season. It comes after the streaming service released a statement saying it was “deeply troubled” by the allegations against Spacey.\\n\\nBut it’s understood the decision to cancel the show was made months ago and was not in response to the claims.\\n\\nWhile it’s not uncommon for a TV show to end after six years, House of Cards is seen as tentpole show for Netflix, primarily because it was its first.\\n\\nThe statement released by the service read: “In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”\\n\\nDespite the damage to his reputation, the passage of 31 years since the alleged incident involving Rapp protects Spacey from criminal prosecution or a civil suit under New York state law.\\n\\nAs we wait to see who will next comment on Spacey, the net is casting ever wider following Weinstein’s great fall, with victims standing up to powerful predators in Hollywood and across the world.\\n\\nThe New York Post speculated that the next “tipping point” would be the stars who still deny knowing anything, such as Matt Damon and George Clooney, who have pulled out of scheduled public appearances to promote their struggling movie Suburbicon.\\n\\n“Whom else does the industry know about and protect?” the editorial continued. “It’s hard to recall a time when the cultural landscape has shifted so dramatically. More than ever, the general public is inclined to believe self-reporting victims. More than ever, we are inclined to demand that the accused speak, that guilt be met with real consequence.”\\n\\nLeave a comment below, share your stories with emma.reynolds@news.com.au or tweet @emmareyn.\\n\\nOriginally published as Sordid rumours followed Kevin Spacey for years   \n",

Followed categories will be added to My News.\\n\\nLiberal backbencher Ann Sudmalis has hit back at “untrue” reports she was considering breaking ranks and voting against the federal government over the push to establish a royal commission into the banks.\\n\\n“A political stunt like that would not deliver results for the people that elected me, or for the people that have issues with banks,” Ms Sudmalis told News Corp Australia.\\n\\nLiberal MP Warren Entsch has also rejected reports he was considering crossing the floor but is standing by his warning to Treasurer Scott Morrison that “all hell will break loose” if historic allegations of misconduct by Australia’s banks are not investigated.\\n\\nMs Sudmalis said she would continue to work with Malcolm Turnbull and the government on her concerns about the banking sector.\\n\\n“I have done this successfully since being elected, and it’s my belief that this is the best way to get a resolution,” she said.\\n\\nMr Entsch and Ms Sudmalis were named by the ABC, along with Nationals MP George Christensen, as the three Coalition MPs who were considering a backbench revolt over their concerns about the banking sector.\\n\\nAny such move would only add to the chaos of the tumultuous final two weeks of Parliament Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull faces this year, which will include Barnaby Joyce’s by-election and a push to legislate same-sex marriage.\\n\\nMr Entsch told News Corp Australia today he had never mentioned “crossing the floor” to the ABC, and it was never raised with him.\\n\\nSpeaking from New York where he is on secondment to the United Nations, Mr Entsch said he had only mentioned “all hell will break loose” if Mr Morrison failed to look into historic claims of bad behaviour by the banks.\\n\\nHe said he had an assurance from Mr Morrison that he would look into the claims by Christmas and was confident the Treasurer would stand by his word.\\n\\nOne of the claims Mr Entsch wants investigated relates to a pensioner living in a retirement village who lost $1 million.\\n\\n“It’s important we deal with the historical case,” Mr Entsch said.\\n\\n“We have to make sure the victims of the past aren’t overlooked.”\\n\\nMr Christensen has previously threatened to cross the floor vote for the royal commission.\\n\\nA spokesman for Treasurer Scott Morrison told the ABC that both the Treasurer and the Revenue and Financial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer were still working on the matters Mr Entsch had raised.\\n\\nActing Prime Minister Julie Bishop told the program last night the government would work with the MPs whose constituents had concerns about the banks.\\n\\nBut she said a banking royal commission would not provide them with redress.\\n\\n“It would only make recommendations and that could be years away and that’s why we’re trying to take action now,” she said.\\n\\n“I’m sure my fellow members of Parliament understand that.”\\n\\nThe reports come as Mr Turnbull deals with the fallout from the High Court ruling on the “citizenship seven”, which saw Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and senator Fiona Nash disqualified from Parliament.\\n\\nMr Turnbull now faces the possibility of an embarrassing backbench revolt over the banking royal commission in the final sitting weeks of the year when, for at least a week, he won’t have a one-seat majority in the lower house due to Mr Joyce’s departure.\\n\\nIt’s also likely to coincide with an attempt to legislate same-sex marriage before Christmas — another powder keg issue set to reignite divisions in the Coalition.\\n\\nTrade Minister Steve Ciobo today questioned why his colleagues would threaten to cross the floor, given the government was already cracking down on bad bank behaviour.\\n\\n“What is the rationale for doing that? The simple fact is that as a government we’re taking concrete steps to do several things,” he told ABC radio.\\n\\n“One, we’re reinforcing the role that ASIC has in terms of being a judge in relation to corporate behaviour.\\n\\n“The second thing is we’ve implemented a whole range of new legislation including new accountability frameworks on the banking executives for the decisions that they take.”\\n\\nHe said Labor’s call for a royal commission was a stunt.\\n\\nOriginally published as Three Coalition MPs could cross floor to launch banking royal commission   \n",

                                                                                                                                                         Late Sunday, as a weekend of frenzied speculation and spin drew to an anxious close, #MuellerMonday began to trend on Twitter. A few hours later, a little more than two days after CNN broke the news that a grand jury had approved charges in special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation, the names were revealed.\\n\\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, who stayed on with the Trump team through the election and into 2017, will face charges including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, making false statements, and more.\\n\\nThe indictments, though, included no suggestion of election meddling. Manafort and Gates’ alleged crimes took place before they signed up with the candidate. President Donald Trump quickly logged on and began to gloat.\\n\\nBut there was more. It was also revealed that George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump, had pleaded guilty earlier this month to making a false statement to the FBI. His lie – or the truth beyond it – was potentially more damaging than anything to do with Manafort and Gates. Papadopoulos copped to misleading investigators about a conversation with a Russian “contact,” believed to have ties to Moscow, about “dirt” related to Hillary Clinton’s emails.\\n\\nBy noon on #MuellerMonday, the initial flurry of reactions and responses settled into four distinct camps – some hewing closer to reality than others.\\n\\nSenate Democrats and most of their colleagues in the House, in particular those tied to ongoing congressional investigations into the Trump campaign and Russia, mostly kept mum – careful not to further politicize the process and potentially give Trump a pretext for dismissing Mueller. Most Republicans were cautious too, clearly conscious of the President’s ire.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in a series of tweets, steered clear of the particulars.\\n\\n“The special counsel’s probe is ongoing in a serious way. The rule of law is paramount in America & the investigation must proceed unimpeded,” Schumer began. “(Trump) must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way. If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally, and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues.”\\n\\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was also vague on Manafort, Gates and Papadopoulos. In a statement, she pushed for “an outside, fully independent investigation to expose Russia’s meddling in our election and the involvement of Trump officials.” Translation: a probe that can’t be called off, in the way Trump can fire Mueller, at the whim of the White House.\\n\\n“The President should let the special counsel do his job,” said Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, adding later in a statement that he didn’t have any more information on Mueller’s doings than what had been made public. (He too scurried away when pressed for more by reporters.)\\n\\nLiberal grassroots groups were also careful not to overplay the moment.\\n\\nMoveOn.org blasted an email to reporters trumpeting the “300+ events” being planned to launch in case Trump “interferes with the criminal investigation into his campaign and administration.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Indivisible co-executive director Ezra Levin urged his followers to keep their eyes on Capitol Hill: “Even on #ManafortMonday, we need to focus on where we have leverage. Right now, that’s the #TrumpTaxScam,” a reference to ongoing fight over the Republican tax plan.\\n\\nLiberal social media channels were less restrained. They have, in many cases, openly agitated for Trump’s impeachment or more aggressive action as it relates to Russia and the campaign. For them, the indictments – and the guilty plea on top of that – felt like a major step forward.\\n\\nRep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, was typically dramatic. He addressed a bunch of the big names in a series of Monday morning tweets.\\n\\n“Dear Paul Manafort & Richard Gates: Here’s a fun fact for you. Federal prosecutors have a conviction rate of 93%,” he started off, linking to an early story about the indictments. “Thank you Special Counsel Mueller for draining the Swamp. #MAGA,” he posted a couple hours later. Lieu then tagged Trump in three more messages.\\n\\n“We the people must never tolerate our leaders’ collaboration with foreign adversaries against us,” Evan McMullin, the former presidential candidate and conservative favorite of the the liberal #resistance, tweeted at 8:41 a.m. ET. The grim declaration hinted at more serious allegations than could be found in any of the new court documents.\\n\\nA little after noon, he added: “Trump and his surrogates seem to confuse widely known and overt collusion with ‘no evidence’ of it. We’ve seen enough already.”\\n\\nFormer Obama Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller, another heavy presence on Twitter, suggested the potential for a direct, and much more recent, connection between the Papadopolous plea and Trump.\\n\\n“The FBI interview where Papadopolous lied about his Russia contacts came on the same day, Jan. 27, Trump asked Comey for a loyalty pledge,” he noted ominously. (There is nothing material, at this point, to suggest any connection between the two events.)\\n\\nHow, you ask, can one person make those two claims at once?\\n\\nTrump managed it in a pair of tweets.\\n\\n“Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” he wrote in response to initial reports, adding: “But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????”\\n\\nFox News and other conservative outlets loyal to the White House mostly kept in step with Trump throughout the early afternoon, focusing on what was not in the indictments and asking why Clinton had not come under more scrutiny. This is a familiar tactic for stoking the kind of partisan and tribal resentments that might blind segments of the public to the facts on the ground.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders pursued that line repeatedly during her afternoon briefing.\\n\\n“The real collusion scandal, as we’ve said several times before, has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,” she said, after dismissing the indictments as unrelated to Trump. “There’s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence the election.”\\n\\nConservative commentator Erick Erickson steered clear of the Clinton conspiracy theories and summed up the prevailing wisdom in more sober right-wing quarters.\\n\\n“Much of the political left is cheering about the indictment of Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort,” he wrote in a piece for FoxNews.com. “They think it will undermine President Trump. The problem, though, is that it appears increasingly likely that Manfort’s indictment has nothing to do with the Trump campaign.”\\n\\nFor Republicans who have either staked their careers or legislative agenda to Trump, there is simply no political upside – at least that they can see – in engaging with these issues.\\n\\n“Every morning, I wake up in my office and I scroll through Twitter to see which tweets I’ll have to pretend I didn’t see later on,” House Speaker Paul Ryan joked at the Al Smith Dinner in New York a couple weeks ago.\\n\\nOn Monday morning, he seemed to reprise that act, telling reporters in Wisconsin he hadn’t been paying close attention to the latest developments.\\n\\n“It is big news, but this is what you get from a special counsel – they made an indictment,” he said. “I really have nothing to add because I haven’t even read it, so I’m not going to speculate on something I haven’t read.”\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also steered clear of the Mueller drama. He spoke at a press conference on the Hill but ducked out rather than take questions from reporters.   \n",

Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nWASHINGTON -- A former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, special counsel Robert Mueller said Monday, while former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manafort's business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the United States and other counts.\\n\\nThe guilty plea by former adviser George Papadopoulos marked the first criminal case that cites interactions between Trump campaign associates and Russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential campaign. The developments ushered Mueller's sprawling investigation into a new phase with felony charges and possible prison sentences for key members of the Trump team including Manafort, who led the campaign during critical months, and Rick Gates, a campaign aide.\\n\\nCourt papers also revealed that Papadopoulos was told about the Russians possessing \"dirt\" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" on April 26, 2016, well before it became public that the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails had been hacked.\\n\\nPapadopoulos has been cooperating with investigators, according to court papers, a potentially ominous sign for others in the Trump orbit who might be implicated by his statements.\\n\\nDuring the daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, saying it was \"extremely limited.\"\\n\\n\"He was not paid by the campaign,\" Sanders said, adding later: \"Any actions that he took would have been on his own.\"\\n\\nShe said the White House has had \"indications\" that Mueller's investigation would conclude \"soon.\"\\n\\nThe president quickly tweeted about the allegations against Manafort, saying the alleged crimes were \"years ago,\" and insisting there was \"NO COLLUSION\" between his campaign and Russia.\\n\\nHe added, as he has a number of times recently, \"Why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus--?\"\\n\\nManafort and Gates appeared in federal court in Washington and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\\n\\nPapadopoulos' plea occurred on Oct. 5 and was unsealed Monday. In court papers, he admitted lying to FBI agents about the nature of his interactions with \"foreign nationals\" who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials. Those interactions included speaking with Russian intermediaries who were attempting to line up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and offering \"dirt\" on Clinton.\\n\\nThe court filings don't provide details on the emails or whom Papadopoulos may have told about the Russian government effort.\\n\\nThe FBI interviewed Papadopoulos about his Russian connections on Jan. 27, a week after Trump's inauguration. The interview predates Mueller's appointment but was part of the FBI probe into Russian election interference that he has taken over.\\n\\nPapadopoulos was arrested over the summer at Dulles International Airport and has since met with the government \"on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions.\"\\n\\nThe separate charges against Manafort and Rick Gates contend the men acted as unregistered foreign agents for Ukrainian interests. The indictments also include other financial counts involving tens of millions of dollars routed through offshore accounts.\\n\\nManafort's indictment doesn't reference the Trump campaign or make any allegations about coordination between the Kremlin and the president's aides to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. The indictment does allege a criminal conspiracy was continuing through February of this year, after Trump had taken office.\\n\\nThe indictment filed in federal court in Washington accuses both Manafort and Gates of funneling payments through foreign companies and bank accounts as part of their political work in Ukraine. The two men surrendered to federal authorities Monday, and were expected in court later in the day to face the charges brought by Mueller's team.\\n\\nThe indictment lays out 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements and several charges related to failing to report foreign bank and financial accounts. The indictment alleges the men moved money through hidden bank accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Seychelles.\\n\\nIn total, more than $75 million flowed through the offshore accounts, according to the indictment. Manafort is accused of laundering more than $18 million.\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort did not immediately return calls or text messages requesting comment. Manafort and Gates have previously denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\nManafort, 68, was fired as Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The indictment against Manafort and Gates was largely based on activities disclosed in August 2016 by The Associated Press, which reported that the pair had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party.\\n\\nCiting internal emails, the AP noted that Gates personally directed the work of two prominent Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group. The indictment doesn't refer to the companies by name.\\n\\nSpecifically, the indictment accuses Manafort of using \"his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.\" That included using offshore accounts to purchase multimillion-dollar properties in the U.S., some of which the government is seeking to seize.\\n\\nMueller was appointed as special counsel in May to lead the Justice Department's investigation into whether the Kremlin worked with associates of the Trump campaign to tip the presidential election.\\n\\nThe appointment came one week after the firing of James Comey, who as FBI director led the investigation, and also followed the recusal months earlier of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the probe.\\n\\nManafort joined Trump's campaign in March 2016 and oversaw the Republican National Convention delegate strategy. Trump pushed him out in August amid a stream of negative headlines about Manafort's foreign consulting work.\\n\\nTrump's middle son, Eric Trump, said in an interview at the time that his father was concerned that questions about Manafort's past were taking attention away from the billionaire's presidential bid.\\n\\nManafort has been a subject of a longstanding FBI investigation into his dealings in Ukraine and work for the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. That investigation was incorporated into Mueller's broader probe. In July, his investigators raided one of Manafort's homes in Virginia, searching for tax and international banking records.\\n\\nPreviously, he denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it \"was totally open and appropriate.\"\\n\\nManafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgment that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law. The indictment Monday accuses Manafort and Gates of making several false and misleading statements in that FARA filing.\\n\\nMueller's investigation has also reached into the White House, as he examines the circumstances of Comey's firing. Investigators have requested extensive documents and have interviewed multiple current and former officials.\\n\\nMueller's grand jury has also heard testimony about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York attended by a Russian lawyer as well as Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\\n\\nIn Gates, Mueller brings in not just Manafort's chief deputy, but a key player from Trump's campaign who survived Manafort's ouster last summer. As of two weeks ago, Gates was still working for Tom Barrack, a Trump confidant, helping with the closeout of the inauguration committee's campaign account.   \n",

Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nWASHINGTON -- A former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, special counsel Robert Mueller said Monday, while former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manafort's business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the United States and other counts.\\n\\nThe guilty plea by former adviser George Papadopoulos marked the first criminal case that cites interactions between Trump campaign associates and Russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential campaign. The developments ushered Mueller's sprawling investigation into a new phase with felony charges and possible prison sentences for key members of the Trump team including Manafort, who led the campaign during critical months, and Rick Gates, a campaign aide.\\n\\nCourt papers also revealed that Papadopoulos was told about the Russians possessing \"dirt\" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" on April 26, 2016, well before it became public that the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails had been hacked.\\n\\nPapadopoulos has been cooperating with investigators, according to court papers, a potentially ominous sign for others in the Trump orbit who might be implicated by his statements.\\n\\nDuring the daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, saying it was \"extremely limited.\"\\n\\n\"He was not paid by the campaign,\" Sanders said, adding later: \"Any actions that he took would have been on his own.\"\\n\\nShe said the White House has had \"indications\" that Mueller's investigation would conclude \"soon.\"\\n\\nThe president quickly tweeted about the allegations against Manafort, saying the alleged crimes were \"years ago,\" and insisting there was \"NO COLLUSION\" between his campaign and Russia.\\n\\nHe added, as he has a number of times recently, \"Why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus--?\"\\n\\nManafort and Gates appeared in federal court in Washington and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\\n\\nPapadopoulos' plea occurred on Oct. 5 and was unsealed Monday. In court papers, he admitted lying to FBI agents about the nature of his interactions with \"foreign nationals\" who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials. Those interactions included speaking with Russian intermediaries who were attempting to line up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and offering \"dirt\" on Clinton.\\n\\nThe court filings don't provide details on the emails or whom Papadopoulos may have told about the Russian government effort.\\n\\nThe FBI interviewed Papadopoulos about his Russian connections on Jan. 27, a week after Trump's inauguration. The interview predates Mueller's appointment but was part of the FBI probe into Russian election interference that he has taken over.\\n\\nPapadopoulos was arrested over the summer at Dulles International Airport and has since met with the government \"on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions.\"\\n\\nThe separate charges against Manafort and Rick Gates contend the men acted as unregistered foreign agents for Ukrainian interests. The indictments also include other financial counts involving tens of millions of dollars routed through offshore accounts.\\n\\nManafort's indictment doesn't reference the Trump campaign or make any allegations about coordination between the Kremlin and the president's aides to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. The indictment does allege a criminal conspiracy was continuing through February of this year, after Trump had taken office.\\n\\nThe indictment filed in federal court in Washington accuses both Manafort and Gates of funneling payments through foreign companies and bank accounts as part of their political work in Ukraine. The two men surrendered to federal authorities Monday, and were expected in court later in the day to face the charges brought by Mueller's team.\\n\\nThe indictment lays out 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements and several charges related to failing to report foreign bank and financial accounts. The indictment alleges the men moved money through hidden bank accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Seychelles.\\n\\nIn total, more than $75 million flowed through the offshore accounts, according to the indictment. Manafort is accused of laundering more than $18 million.\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort did not immediately return calls or text messages requesting comment. Manafort and Gates have previously denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\nManafort, 68, was fired as Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The indictment against Manafort and Gates was largely based on activities disclosed in August 2016 by The Associated Press, which reported that the pair had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party.\\n\\nCiting internal emails, the AP noted that Gates personally directed the work of two prominent Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group. The indictment doesn't refer to the companies by name.\\n\\nSpecifically, the indictment accuses Manafort of using \"his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.\" That included using offshore accounts to purchase multimillion-dollar properties in the U.S., some of which the government is seeking to seize.\\n\\nMueller was appointed as special counsel in May to lead the Justice Department's investigation into whether the Kremlin worked with associates of the Trump campaign to tip the presidential election.\\n\\nThe appointment came one week after the firing of James Comey, who as FBI director led the investigation, and also followed the recusal months earlier of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the probe.\\n\\nManafort joined Trump's campaign in March 2016 and oversaw the Republican National Convention delegate strategy. Trump pushed him out in August amid a stream of negative headlines about Manafort's foreign consulting work.\\n\\nTrump's middle son, Eric Trump, said in an interview at the time that his father was concerned that questions about Manafort's past were taking attention away from the billionaire's presidential bid.\\n\\nManafort has been a subject of a longstanding FBI investigation into his dealings in Ukraine and work for the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. That investigation was incorporated into Mueller's broader probe. In July, his investigators raided one of Manafort's homes in Virginia, searching for tax and international banking records.\\n\\nPreviously, he denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it \"was totally open and appropriate.\"\\n\\nManafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgment that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law. The indictment Monday accuses Manafort and Gates of making several false and misleading statements in that FARA filing.\\n\\nMueller's investigation has also reached into the White House, as he examines the circumstances of Comey's firing. Investigators have requested extensive documents and have interviewed multiple current and former officials.\\n\\nMueller's grand jury has also heard testimony about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York attended by a Russian lawyer as well as Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\\n\\nIn Gates, Mueller brings in not just Manafort's chief deputy, but a key player from Trump's campaign who survived Manafort's ouster last summer. As of two weeks ago, Gates was still working for Tom Barrack, a Trump confidant, helping with the closeout of the inauguration committee's campaign account.   \n",

General Rod Rosenstein announced he was handing over the reins of the Justice Department's Russia investigation to a special counsel, he gave Robert Mueller the authority to look into \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\\n\\nIt has become clear in the time since that Mueller intends to use that clause to follow the money.\\n\\nThe former FBI director has assembled a team of lawyers, many of whom specialize in white collar law and financial crimes, leading to speculation that he is diving into the finances of those on the inner and outer orbit of the Trump campaign.\\n\\n\"They're looking for ties, they're looking for relationships, and a lot of that will come down to money trails,\" said Jennifer Rodgers, the executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to chargeable offenses Mueller could be zeroing in on, money laundering is at the top of the list.\\n\\nPop culture phenomena like Breaking Bad and Office Space have provided some education — but many people don't really know what money laundering is or how it works.\\n\\nHere's an explainer (jump to specific sections by clicking on the links below):\\n\\nPut simply: Money laundering turns \"dirty\" money \"clean\" — making proceeds from criminal activity usable without drawing the attention of law enforcement.\\n\\nJohn Cassara, a money laundering expert who worked for the State Department and the Department of Treasury for more than 25 years, says money launderers work through a three-step system.\\n\\n1. Placement: This is the first time that money acquired through a crime — stolen, say, or through drug or human trafficking — enters the financial system. The cash can be blended into a legitimate business' cash flow and receipts, or deposited in small amounts to banks for later transfer. This is where launderers are most vulnerable to being caught, says Cassara, as banks and financial institutions have a number of tools to try to catch suspicious activity.\\n\\nIntel, for instance, just announced new artificial intelligence software that monitors \"transactions and suggestive personality behaviors\" to catch would-be launderers, according to Axios.\\n\\n2. Layering: The second step is where a money launderer covers their tracks. By transferring the money between companies and accounts in different places, the goal here is to make it difficult for law enforcement to follow the trail because of jurisdictional issues and transparency laws.\\n\\nMany countries and even some states require very little personal information to start a company, leading bad actors to start what are called \"shell companies\" — companies without any purpose other than to be a disguising vehicle for money to change hands.\\n\\nBy the time someone is spending money in the United States, for example, it might have been transferred from Cyprus, having been transferred from Ukraine, having been transferred from, say, Russia, where it might have been stolen or received as payment in the drug or human trafficking trade.\\n\\n\"You can also layer it by switching it from cash to gold to cyber to commodities,\" Cassara said.\\n\\n3. Integration: Once the money has been moved, moved and moved again, it's time to legitimize it. Cassara says luxury items, property or stock investments are all options for a criminal to park the rewards of the ill-gotten gains.\\n\\nFor example, there are whole sections of the richest sections of London owned by wealthy foreigners that mostly sit empty, leading locals to wonder whether they're at the end of a pipeline of illicit money. Real estate in hot markets such as London or New York is a good investment for anyone because it seldom loses value and can often be quickly resold in legitimate transactions, freeing up cash. In the U.K., people call this phenomenon \"Lights Out London.\"\\n\\n\"Outside of crimes of passion, for example murder committed in a jealous rage, why do criminals and criminal organizations commit crime?\" Cassara asks rhetorically. \"Greed.\"\\n\\n\"Essentially, with any crime that generates money, the criminal needs to launder the money in order to use it,\" says Stefanie Ostfeld, the deputy head of the U.S. office for Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on exposing economic networks that breed corruption.\\n\\n\"The issue with money laundering is it tends to take two to money launder: You have the criminal who committed the original crime, but then you also have the bank, the lawyer, the accountant that actually moved the money into the financial system.\"\\n\\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that between 2 percent and 5 percent of global gross domestic product is laundered each year. Even if you take the lowest end of that guess, it's around $800 billion.\\n\\nOstfeld says the root of the problem is lax laws that make it easy to create businesses, or shell companies, with anonymous or hard-to-trace owners as part of the layering process.\\n\\n\"Time and time again, our investigations highlight the same problem,\" Ostfeld said. \"That's sham companies that allow those who steal state funds to move it undetected through the international financial system.\"\\n\\nPlaces like the island of Jersey and the Cayman Islands have reputations as shell company havens, but an article published earlier this year in The Atlantic found the U.S. to be \"perhaps the foremost shell-company provider globally.\"\\n\\nDelaware, for instance, is famous around the world for being an easy place to set up a shell company. In 2012, the state had more corporate entities than people, according to The New York Times. And as NPR reported, at least one entity linked with Russian advocates who want the U.S. to roll back sanctions on Moscow is chartered in Delaware.\\n\\nAre governments trying to crack down?\\n\\nOver the past 50 years, the U.S. has made policy changes toward curbing money laundering. Notably, Congress passed the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, which requires banks to report cash transactions over $10,000.\\n\\nIn 1986, the Money Laundering Control Act made money laundering a federal crime, and laws in the 1990s pushed financial institutions to begin filing reports on suspicious activity.\\n\\nStill, Cassara says despite the 18 million or so pieces of \"financial intelligence\" that will be filed in 2017, less than 1 percent of the money that is laundered will be recovered.\\n\\n\"To be a money launderer today, you'd have to be either very stupid or very unlucky to get caught,\" Cassara said. \"The magnitude is really high, but the sobering part is that our success rate is staggeringly low.\"\\n\\nOstfeld said that is because despite having tools at their disposal to quell the money's movement, law enforcement and banks have not made it a priority to do so.\\n\\n\"Bankers are doing the minimum they can get away with,\" Ostfeld said. \"What people don't really understand is that corruption doesn't just hurt people 'over there' ... It actually impacts so many aspects of life, we just don't see it because it's one piece of the puzzle.\\n\\n\"But then you take a step back and you realize it's actually what joins all these crimes together.\"\\n\\nWhy does it matter in the Robert Mueller investigation?\\n\\nIt's not a secret that Trump and those close to his campaign have had some financial ties to Russia.\\n\\n\"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets,\" as Donald Trump Jr. said at a real estate conference in 2008. \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"\\n\\nAnd it's also no secret that corruption in Russia means oligarchs there can't always keep money in Russian banks. They move it overseas, to Europe or the United Kingdom or the U.S., for use in buying real estate or other purposes. Often, they have help: One of the Russians who met with Trump Jr. in June 2016 in Trump Tower, Irakly Kaveladze, was said to have set up some 2,000 shell companies in the United States.\\n\\n\"Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties,\" wrote Craig Unger, in a long feature for The New Republic.\\n\\n\"Whatever his knowledge about the source of his wealth, the public record makes clear that Trump built his business empire in no small part with a lot of dirty money from a lot of dirty Russians.\"\\n\\nRodgers of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity says it may not be Trump who should necessarily worry about money laundering charges at this point. The president may have good reason to fear, according to some reports, but the person in the most pressing legal jeopardy could be Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\\n\\nMcClatchy reported in August that Mueller was \"zeroing in\" on Manafort's finances.\\n\\n\"I personally think they're looking at money laundering for Manafort,\" Rodgers said. \"It looks like they may get something there, given the sheer number of accounts he has, and the number of transactions involved.\"\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort declined to comment for this story. No one has been charged with any crime so far in the Russia imbroglio, and Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Russia.\\n\\nAll the same, observers including Rodgers say Mueller may try to use the threat of financial charges to flip Manafort into being a witness against others in the campaign.\\n\\n\"Anyone facing serious charges for money laundering and tax offenses involving undisclosed foreign bank accounts would have huge incentives to trade cooperation for prison time,\" Jonathan Winer, the State Department's top money laundering expert during the Clinton administration, told McClatchy.\\n\\nDetails about how deep Manafort's ties go continue to emerge.\\n\\nNBC reported recently on a $26 million loan between Manafort and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, making the pair's total financial relationship about $60 million over the past decade.\\n\\n\"Money launderers frequently will disguise payments as loans,\" Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor, told NBC. \"You can call it a loan, you can call it 'Mary Jane.' If there's no intent to repay it, then it's not really a loan. It's just a payment.\"\\n\\nWhile there aren't any charges yet, Mueller's prosecutors reportedly told Manafort in September that they plan at some point to indict him.\\n\\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

General Rod Rosenstein announced he was handing over the reins of the Justice Department's Russia investigation to a special counsel, he gave Robert Mueller the authority to look into \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\\n\\nIt has become clear in the time since that Mueller intends to use that clause to follow the money.\\n\\nThe former FBI director has assembled a team of lawyers, many of whom specialize in white collar law and financial crimes, leading to speculation that he is diving into the finances of those on the inner and outer orbit of the Trump campaign.\\n\\n\"They're looking for ties, they're looking for relationships, and a lot of that will come down to money trails,\" said Jennifer Rodgers, the executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to chargeable offenses Mueller could be zeroing in on, money laundering is at the top of the list.\\n\\nPop culture phenomena like Breaking Bad and Office Space have provided some education — but many people don't really know what money laundering is or how it works.\\n\\nHere's an explainer (jump to specific sections by clicking on the links below):\\n\\nPut simply: Money laundering turns \"dirty\" money \"clean\" — making proceeds from criminal activity usable without drawing the attention of law enforcement.\\n\\nJohn Cassara, a money laundering expert who worked for the State Department and the Department of Treasury for more than 25 years, says money launderers work through a three-step system.\\n\\n1. Placement: This is the first time that money acquired through a crime — stolen, say, or through drug or human trafficking — enters the financial system. The cash can be blended into a legitimate business' cash flow and receipts, or deposited in small amounts to banks for later transfer. This is where launderers are most vulnerable to being caught, says Cassara, as banks and financial institutions have a number of tools to try to catch suspicious activity.\\n\\nIntel, for instance, just announced new artificial intelligence software that monitors \"transactions and suggestive personality behaviors\" to catch would-be launderers, according to Axios.\\n\\n2. Layering: The second step is where a money launderer covers their tracks. By transferring the money between companies and accounts in different places, the goal here is to make it difficult for law enforcement to follow the trail because of jurisdictional issues and transparency laws.\\n\\nMany countries and even some states require very little personal information to start a company, leading bad actors to start what are called \"shell companies\" — companies without any purpose other than to be a disguising vehicle for money to change hands.\\n\\nBy the time someone is spending money in the United States, for example, it might have been transferred from Cyprus, having been transferred from Ukraine, having been transferred from, say, Russia, where it might have been stolen or received as payment in the drug or human trafficking trade.\\n\\n\"You can also layer it by switching it from cash to gold to cyber to commodities,\" Cassara said.\\n\\n3. Integration: Once the money has been moved, moved and moved again, it's time to legitimize it. Cassara says luxury items, property or stock investments are all options for a criminal to park the rewards of the ill-gotten gains.\\n\\nFor example, there are whole sections of the richest sections of London owned by wealthy foreigners that mostly sit empty, leading locals to wonder whether they're at the end of a pipeline of illicit money. Real estate in hot markets such as London or New York is a good investment for anyone because it seldom loses value and can often be quickly resold in legitimate transactions, freeing up cash. In the U.K., people call this phenomenon \"Lights Out London.\"\\n\\n\"Outside of crimes of passion, for example murder committed in a jealous rage, why do criminals and criminal organizations commit crime?\" Cassara asks rhetorically. \"Greed.\"\\n\\n\"Essentially, with any crime that generates money, the criminal needs to launder the money in order to use it,\" says Stefanie Ostfeld, the deputy head of the U.S. office for Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on exposing economic networks that breed corruption.\\n\\n\"The issue with money laundering is it tends to take two to money launder: You have the criminal who committed the original crime, but then you also have the bank, the lawyer, the accountant that actually moved the money into the financial system.\"\\n\\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that between 2 percent and 5 percent of global gross domestic product is laundered each year. Even if you take the lowest end of that guess, it's around $800 billion.\\n\\nOstfeld says the root of the problem is lax laws that make it easy to create businesses, or shell companies, with anonymous or hard-to-trace owners as part of the layering process.\\n\\n\"Time and time again, our investigations highlight the same problem,\" Ostfeld said. \"That's sham companies that allow those who steal state funds to move it undetected through the international financial system.\"\\n\\nPlaces like the island of Jersey and the Cayman Islands have reputations as shell company havens, but an article published earlier this year in The Atlantic found the U.S. to be \"perhaps the foremost shell-company provider globally.\"\\n\\nDelaware, for instance, is famous around the world for being an easy place to set up a shell company. In 2012, the state had more corporate entities than people, according to The New York Times. And as NPR reported, at least one entity linked with Russian advocates who want the U.S. to roll back sanctions on Moscow is chartered in Delaware.\\n\\nAre governments trying to crack down?\\n\\nOver the past 50 years, the U.S. has made policy changes toward curbing money laundering. Notably, Congress passed the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, which requires banks to report cash transactions over $10,000.\\n\\nIn 1986, the Money Laundering Control Act made money laundering a federal crime, and laws in the 1990s pushed financial institutions to begin filing reports on suspicious activity.\\n\\nStill, Cassara says despite the 18 million or so pieces of \"financial intelligence\" that will be filed in 2017, less than 1 percent of the money that is laundered will be recovered.\\n\\n\"To be a money launderer today, you'd have to be either very stupid or very unlucky to get caught,\" Cassara said. \"The magnitude is really high, but the sobering part is that our success rate is staggeringly low.\"\\n\\nOstfeld said that is because despite having tools at their disposal to quell the money's movement, law enforcement and banks have not made it a priority to do so.\\n\\n\"Bankers are doing the minimum they can get away with,\" Ostfeld said. \"What people don't really understand is that corruption doesn't just hurt people 'over there' ... It actually impacts so many aspects of life, we just don't see it because it's one piece of the puzzle.\\n\\n\"But then you take a step back and you realize it's actually what joins all these crimes together.\"\\n\\nWhy does it matter in the Robert Mueller investigation?\\n\\nIt's not a secret that Trump and those close to his campaign have had some financial ties to Russia.\\n\\n\"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets,\" as Donald Trump Jr. said at a real estate conference in 2008. \"We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"\\n\\nAnd it's also no secret that corruption in Russia means oligarchs there can't always keep money in Russian banks. They move it overseas, to Europe or the United Kingdom or the U.S., for use in buying real estate or other purposes. Often, they have help: One of the Russians who met with Trump Jr. in June 2016 in Trump Tower, Irakly Kaveladze, was said to have set up some 2,000 shell companies in the United States.\\n\\n\"Over the past three decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to Russian mobsters or oligarchs have owned, lived in and even run criminal activities out of Trump Tower and other Trump properties,\" wrote Craig Unger, in a long feature for The New Republic.\\n\\n\"Whatever his knowledge about the source of his wealth, the public record makes clear that Trump built his business empire in no small part with a lot of dirty money from a lot of dirty Russians.\"\\n\\nRodgers of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity says it may not be Trump who should necessarily worry about money laundering charges at this point. The president may have good reason to fear, according to some reports, but the person in the most pressing legal jeopardy could be Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\\n\\nMcClatchy reported in August that Mueller was \"zeroing in\" on Manafort's finances.\\n\\n\"I personally think they're looking at money laundering for Manafort,\" Rodgers said. \"It looks like they may get something there, given the sheer number of accounts he has, and the number of transactions involved.\"\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort declined to comment for this story. No one has been charged with any crime so far in the Russia imbroglio, and Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Russia.\\n\\nAll the same, observers including Rodgers say Mueller may try to use the threat of financial charges to flip Manafort into being a witness against others in the campaign.\\n\\n\"Anyone facing serious charges for money laundering and tax offenses involving undisclosed foreign bank accounts would have huge incentives to trade cooperation for prison time,\" Jonathan Winer, the State Department's top money laundering expert during the Clinton administration, told McClatchy.\\n\\nDetails about how deep Manafort's ties go continue to emerge.\\n\\nNBC reported recently on a $26 million loan between Manafort and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, making the pair's total financial relationship about $60 million over the past decade.\\n\\n\"Money launderers frequently will disguise payments as loans,\" Stefan Cassella, a former federal prosecutor, told NBC. \"You can call it a loan, you can call it 'Mary Jane.' If there's no intent to repay it, then it's not really a loan. It's just a payment.\"\\n\\nWhile there aren't any charges yet, Mueller's prosecutors reportedly told Manafort in September that they plan at some point to indict him.\\n\\nCopyright 2021 NPR.

again changed his story. Danish engineer and inventor Peter Madsen has now admitted to dismembering Swedish journalist Kim Wall's body, police told the Guardian Monday. Madsen, however, still denies killing Wall.\\n\\nThough Madsen initially told authorities Wall died when a hatch fell on her head, he revised his story Monday. Now, Madsen claims Wall died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Madsen also admitted to spreading the dismembered body parts in Koge Bay off Copenhagen. Kim Wall—whose work appeared in Vice, the New York Times, and more—joined Madsen aboard the UC3 Nautilus in August to interview him for an article.\\n\\nWhen Wall did not return from the trip, her partner informed authorities and a search began. Mere hours later, Madsen \"intentionally\" caused the small submarine to sink. Weeks after a headless torso was found floating in Koge Bay and identified as Wall's, investigators recovered her head and legs. Multiple stab wounds were discovered on Wall's body. Divers are still actively searching for Wall's arms and smartphones belonging to Wall and Madsen, CNNreported Monday.\\n\\nLead investigator Jens Moeller Jense said Madsen's latest claims will \"of course\" result in police asking the medical examiner and submarine experts to provide additional statements.\\n\\nIn a Facebook post in August, Kim's mother Ingrid remembered her daughter as someone who made a difference in life. \"During the horrendous days since Kim disappeared, we have received countless examples of how loved and appreciated she was, as a person and as a friend, as well as a professional journalist,\" Ingrid wrote.   \n",

again changed his story. Danish engineer and inventor Peter Madsen has now admitted to dismembering Swedish journalist Kim Wall's body, police told the Guardian Monday. Madsen, however, still denies killing Wall.\\n\\nThough Madsen initially told authorities Wall died when a hatch fell on her head, he revised his story Monday. Now, Madsen claims Wall died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Madsen also admitted to spreading the dismembered body parts in Koge Bay off Copenhagen. Kim Wall—whose work appeared in Vice, the New York Times, and more—joined Madsen aboard the UC3 Nautilus in August to interview him for an article.\\n\\nWhen Wall did not return from the trip, her partner informed authorities and a search began. Mere hours later, Madsen \"intentionally\" caused the small submarine to sink. Weeks after a headless torso was found floating in Koge Bay and identified as Wall's, investigators recovered her head and legs. Multiple stab wounds were discovered on Wall's body. Divers are still actively searching for Wall's arms and smartphones belonging to Wall and Madsen, CNNreported Monday.\\n\\nLead investigator Jens Moeller Jense said Madsen's latest claims will \"of course\" result in police asking the medical examiner and submarine experts to provide additional statements.\\n\\nIn a Facebook post in August, Kim's mother Ingrid remembered her daughter as someone who made a difference in life. \"During the horrendous days since Kim disappeared, we have received countless examples of how loved and appreciated she was, as a person and as a friend, as well as a professional journalist,\" Ingrid wrote.   \n",



                                                                                                                                                             One wonders whether these poseurs know anything at all about the man they've targeted. The 26th president gave us national parks, industrial regulation and environmental conservationism, among other things. He was also the author of over 40 books, some of which chronicle his expeditions and safaris that provided some of the basis for the natural history housed in the museum where he and his trusty steed keep vigil.\\n\\nThe New York vandalism, which isn't directly connected to the recent flurry of protests against Confederate statues, is merely the most recent episode in a protest that gained traction in 2016 by the same groups that also want to change Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day. What apparently triggered the freelance artists were two other figures -- an indigenous American and an African -- flanking Roosevelt's horse.\\n\\nThe jury is still out about what to do about the statue. Nothing would be a rational option, if a panel created by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio can handle some heat. Roosevelt may not be a civil rights icon like Rev. Martin Luther King, but he was hardly the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, either. Indeed, in 1905, Roosevelt gave a speech at the New York Republican Party Club that paid tribute to Abraham Lincoln and addressed racial inequality, which Roosevelt said he aimed to change. That this radical social transformation didn't occur within his time or tenure doesn't affirm in itself that he was racist.\\n\\nIn the speech, he did abysmally refer to whites as a \"forward race.\" But the focus of his address was to echo Lincoln in calling strongly for the raising of minorities' status, which Roosevelt correctly said would benefit the entire country.\\n\\nFirst, both men are walking in a proud, dignified manner, suggesting a parade in which the Rough Rider is accompanied by individuals who were part of his life experience. Second, we have to ask, what was the context of the time? Without the historical backdrop, criticism -- of politics, art or literature -- is meaningless.\\n\\nIn 1901, when this Harvard-educated, wealthy, progressive, worldly Republican New Yorker became president, was he enslaving Indians and blacks? No. Was he hunting extensively in the American West and later in Africa? Yes. Quite a lot. Given this record, is it not possible that the other two figures represent his guides or scouts on his American West hunts and African safaris?\\n\\nThe statue, created as a historical representation of the man and erected to honor his contributions to our knowledge of natural history, may be offensive to a few, but by what imperative are their feelings to be considered superior to the broader citizenry's right to not see public property harmed, defaced or splattered with paint -- or some facsimile thereof?\\n\\nMake an argument. Present facts. Bring passion but keep a cool head. One could argue, for example, that the protests against Confederate statues are substantively different from the objections to Roosevelt's monument. Given that most Civil War statues in the South were erected during the civil rights movement, inarguably, they memorialize not Southern courage but Jim Crow, a cowardly, despicable period of state-sponsored terrorism against blacks who had the audacity to insist upon equality under the law.\\n\\nConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, who hated the idea of memorials to the war, would likely be happy for his statues to settle in a statuary hall. As for Roosevelt, one only wishes the swashbuckling warrior-president could dismount for a few minutes and teach his vandals some manners. I'm guessing, but I suspect his two companions would lend him a hand.   \n",

                                                       The study was small and used a surrogate endpoint, so the true value of hybrid revascularization won’t be known until a large-scale study is done.\\n\\nDENVER, CO—Hybrid revascularization, one that combines bypass grafting with PCI, fails to reduce myocardial ischemia and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events when compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery and PCI alone, according to the results of the small Hybrid Revascularization Versus Standards (HREVS) study.\\n\\nPresenting the results today at TCT 2017, lead investigator Roman Tarasov, MD (State Research Institute for Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases, Kemerovo, Russia), said they found “no evidence of benefit” with the hybrid revascularization approach, at least in the short term, for the treatment of patients with multivessel disease.\\n\\nFurther studies, including larger randomized trials, are needed to determine the clinical role of hybrid revascularization, he added.\\n\\nSuch trials are currently underway. The US National Institutes of Health-funded HYBRID trial, a 5-year study led by John Puskas, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), and Gregg Stone, MD (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY), is currently enrolling patients. In that study, more than 2,300 patients with multivessel disease will be randomized to the hybrid revascularization approach or PCI alone, although the results won’t be available for a few years.\\n\\nHREVS, which was presented during a First Reports session, included 155 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease considered by the multidisciplinary heart team to be candidates for CABG surgery, PCI, or hybrid revascularization.\\n\\nIn total, 50 patients were treated with CABG surgery, 53 with PCI, and 52 with the hybrid revascularization approach that included minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) followed by PCI 1 to 3 days after the procedure. Importantly, the hybrid technique included grafting the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and drug-eluting stents for the remaining vessels.\\n\\nRegarding the primary endpoint of residual myocardial ischemia assessed by SPECT at 12 months, which Tarasov said is an index of revascularization quality and a marker of long-term clinical outcomes, there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups. The study was underpowered for clinical endpoints, but there were no statistically significant differences at 30 days. There was more bleeding in the CABG-treated patients, an unsurprising finding, said Tarasov.\\n\\nHolger Thiele, MD (Heart Center Leipzig, Germany), who was not involved in the study, told TCTMD hybrid revascularization is not frequently performed in Europe, noting there are limited data supporting its use. “It’s not common,” he said. “If you discuss a patient with the heart team, it’s usually black or white—we do surgery or we do PCI.”\\n\\nAn Idea Around for 20 Years\\n\\nChairing the morning press conference where the HREVS results were first presented, Roxana Mehran, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY), said the potential utility of a hybrid revascularization approach has been discussed for more than 20 years.\\n\\n“We knew, before drug-eluting stents came around, that the best therapy to protect the patient is a LIMA to the LAD,” she said. “That’s what the surgeons told us. That’s why we always continue to think about repeat revascularization and worry about new lesions, especially in the LAD. We also know vein grafts don’t have the same durability. So the best of two worlds is a LIMA to the LAD and drug-eluting stents in the non-LAD distribution.”\\n\\nThat said, a hybrid approach is complex, as physicians must grapple with the appropriate antiplatelet regimen, as well as other logistical and procedural issues. Still, with the introduction of the heart team, there are discussions to provide the best care from both worlds—surgical and interventional—to patients, said Mehran.\\n\\nDavid Cohen, MD (Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, MO), one of the panelists discussing HREVS during the morning press conference, agreed with Mehran, stating that the approach has always made “conceptual sense.” He added that the benefits of the hybrid technique utilizing the LIMA to LAD are unlikely to emerge for some time after coronary revascularization.\\n\\n“It’s 10 years, 20 years,” said Cohen. “It’s going to take something on that order to really show the benefit of that approach.”   \n",

Trump associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and the guilty plea from former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, have brought the three men into the national spotlight.

                  Don't miss out on the headlines from Celebrities gone bad. Followed categories will be added to My News.\\n\\nAfter Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp claimed the movie star made sexual advances on him when he was 14 and Spacey was 26, it appears many industry insiders were aware of rumours about the star.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, well-known Boston journalist Heather Unruh tweeted: “The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me — #truth time. I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”\\n\\nIt took several days for her accusation to be picked up by news outlets, many of which did not publish her name or Spacey’s “for legal reasons”, although The Sun quoted an insider as saying: “Rumours about this actor have circulated for years ... Lots of people are making allegations after what’s happened with [Harvey] Weinstein.”\\n\\nUnruh was challenged on Twitter by some users, who said her accusations were “hearsay” and that it was unfair “to make an accusation without back-up.”\\n\\nBut the former news anchor replied: “This is 100% true … this person is considering all options about speaking out — not an easy decision.”\\n\\nShe later added: “My intent was to encourage a badly needed investigation and conversation. Plenty of information to be uncovered. #Investigate #It’sNotOk.”\\n\\nAnd it wasn’t just Unruh claiming the 58-year-old American Beauty actor was a sexual predator. In a protected tweet, a woman named Nadine West wrote: “KS groped my young male friend when they were both working at [London theatre] the Old Vic. Was apparently always known as one to avoid. Sadly unsurprised.”\\n\\nAnother commenter tweeted that she had heard similar stories from multiple sources, too.\\n\\nTop London theatre director Victoria Featherstone told BBC Radio 4’s Today that there had been “concerns” over Spacey for years. When asked whether she was aware of stories about Spacey when he was at the Old Vic, the Royal Court Theatre artistic director replied: “I think that many people in the theatre and in the creative industries have been aware of many stories of many people over a lot of years, and Kevin Spacey would be one of the people that people have had concerns about, yes.”\\n\\nSpacey admitted there were “stories out there about me” in his much-maligned apology to Rapp, in which he chose to come out as gay. Fans criticised his timing, saying that revealing the truth about his sexuality while saying sorry looked like a way to deflect attention from the younger actor’s accusation.\\n\\nIt appears the Usual Suspects star’s apology may have been an attempt to head off an even larger chorus of accusations from people who knew this open secret, just as they knew about producer Harvey Weinstein.\\n\\nRapp this week claimed in a Buzzfeed interview that in 1986, when he was a child actor in a Broadway show, Spacey invited him to a party at his Manhattan apartment.\\n\\nAs the only child there, Rapp said he spent most of the evening watching TV in a bedroom, until a drunk Spacey appeared in the room, picked him up “like a groom picks up the bride” and then lay down on top of him. “He was trying to seduce me,” said Rapp, now 46. “I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”\\n\\nRapp said he had found it hard to watch Spacey’s rise to fame, and was increasingly incredulous that anyone would do something like that to a 14-year-old boy.\\n\\nFollowing the House of Cards actor’s apology for his “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”, it has emerged that many other stars already knew about the rumours surrounding him. Rosie O’Donnell responded angrily to his claim that he could not remember what had happened with Rapp, writing: “u don't remember the incident — 30 years ago? — f*** u kevin — like Harvey we all knew about u — I hope more men come forward.”\\n\\nRose McGowan added: “Bye bye, Spacey goodbye, it’s your turn to cry, that’s why we’ve gotta say goodbye.”\\n\\nIn 2005, Seth MacFarlane — who made a pointed joke about Weinstein’s behaviour at the 2013 Oscars — referenced Spacey’s alleged sexual misconduct in an episode of Family Guy. Baby Stewie is seen running naked through a crowd shouting, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement! Help me!”\\n\\nNetflix confirmed to news.com.au it will not renew House of Cards, which is currently filming its sixth season. It comes after the streaming service released a statement saying it was “deeply troubled” by the allegations against Spacey.\\n\\nBut it’s understood the decision to cancel the show was made months ago and was not in response to the claims.\\n\\nWhile it’s not uncommon for a TV show to end after six years, House of Cards is seen as tentpole show for Netflix, primarily because it was its first.\\n\\nThe statement released by the service read: “In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”\\n\\nDespite the damage to his reputation, the passage of 31 years since the alleged incident involving Rapp protects Spacey from criminal prosecution or a civil suit under New York state law.\\n\\nAs we wait to see who will next comment on Spacey, the net is casting ever wider following Weinstein’s great fall, with victims standing up to powerful predators in Hollywood and across the world.\\n\\nThe New York Post speculated that the next “tipping point” would be the stars who still deny knowing anything, such as Matt Damon and George Clooney, who have pulled out of scheduled public appearances to promote their struggling movie Suburbicon.\\n\\n“Whom else does the industry know about and protect?” the editorial continued. “It’s hard to recall a time when the cultural landscape has shifted so dramatically. More than ever, the general public is inclined to believe self-reporting victims. More than ever, we are inclined to demand that the accused speak, that guilt be met with real consequence.”\\n\\nLeave a comment below, share your stories with emma.reynolds@news.com.au or tweet @emmareyn.\\n\\nOriginally published as Sordid rumours followed Kevin Spacey for years   \n",

Followed categories will be added to My News.\\n\\nAfter Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp claimed the movie star made sexual advances on him when he was 14 and Spacey was 26, it appears many industry insiders were aware of rumours about the star.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, well-known Boston journalist Heather Unruh tweeted: “The #weinsteinscandal has emboldened me — #truth time. I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell.”\\n\\nIt took several days for her accusation to be picked up by news outlets, many of which did not publish her name or Spacey’s “for legal reasons”, although The Sun quoted an insider as saying: “Rumours about this actor have circulated for years ... Lots of people are making allegations after what’s happened with [Harvey] Weinstein.”\\n\\nUnruh was challenged on Twitter by some users, who said her accusations were “hearsay” and that it was unfair “to make an accusation without back-up.”\\n\\nBut the former news anchor replied: “This is 100% true … this person is considering all options about speaking out — not an easy decision.”\\n\\nShe later added: “My intent was to encourage a badly needed investigation and conversation. Plenty of information to be uncovered. #Investigate #It’sNotOk.”\\n\\nAnd it wasn’t just Unruh claiming the 58-year-old American Beauty actor was a sexual predator. In a protected tweet, a woman named Nadine West wrote: “KS groped my young male friend when they were both working at [London theatre] the Old Vic. Was apparently always known as one to avoid. Sadly unsurprised.”\\n\\nAnother commenter tweeted that she had heard similar stories from multiple sources, too.\\n\\nTop London theatre director Victoria Featherstone told BBC Radio 4’s Today that there had been “concerns” over Spacey for years. When asked whether she was aware of stories about Spacey when he was at the Old Vic, the Royal Court Theatre artistic director replied: “I think that many people in the theatre and in the creative industries have been aware of many stories of many people over a lot of years, and Kevin Spacey would be one of the people that people have had concerns about, yes.”\\n\\nSpacey admitted there were “stories out there about me” in his much-maligned apology to Rapp, in which he chose to come out as gay. Fans criticised his timing, saying that revealing the truth about his sexuality while saying sorry looked like a way to deflect attention from the younger actor’s accusation.\\n\\nIt appears the Usual Suspects star’s apology may have been an attempt to head off an even larger chorus of accusations from people who knew this open secret, just as they knew about producer Harvey Weinstein.\\n\\nRapp this week claimed in a Buzzfeed interview that in 1986, when he was a child actor in a Broadway show, Spacey invited him to a party at his Manhattan apartment.\\n\\nAs the only child there, Rapp said he spent most of the evening watching TV in a bedroom, until a drunk Spacey appeared in the room, picked him up “like a groom picks up the bride” and then lay down on top of him. “He was trying to seduce me,” said Rapp, now 46. “I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”\\n\\nRapp said he had found it hard to watch Spacey’s rise to fame, and was increasingly incredulous that anyone would do something like that to a 14-year-old boy.\\n\\nFollowing the House of Cards actor’s apology for his “deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour”, it has emerged that many other stars already knew about the rumours surrounding him. Rosie O’Donnell responded angrily to his claim that he could not remember what had happened with Rapp, writing: “u don't remember the incident — 30 years ago? — f*** u kevin — like Harvey we all knew about u — I hope more men come forward.”\\n\\nRose McGowan added: “Bye bye, Spacey goodbye, it’s your turn to cry, that’s why we’ve gotta say goodbye.”\\n\\nIn 2005, Seth MacFarlane — who made a pointed joke about Weinstein’s behaviour at the 2013 Oscars — referenced Spacey’s alleged sexual misconduct in an episode of Family Guy. Baby Stewie is seen running naked through a crowd shouting, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement! Help me!”\\n\\nNetflix confirmed to news.com.au it will not renew House of Cards, which is currently filming its sixth season. It comes after the streaming service released a statement saying it was “deeply troubled” by the allegations against Spacey.\\n\\nBut it’s understood the decision to cancel the show was made months ago and was not in response to the claims.\\n\\nWhile it’s not uncommon for a TV show to end after six years, House of Cards is seen as tentpole show for Netflix, primarily because it was its first.\\n\\nThe statement released by the service read: “In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.”\\n\\nDespite the damage to his reputation, the passage of 31 years since the alleged incident involving Rapp protects Spacey from criminal prosecution or a civil suit under New York state law.\\n\\nAs we wait to see who will next comment on Spacey, the net is casting ever wider following Weinstein’s great fall, with victims standing up to powerful predators in Hollywood and across the world.\\n\\nThe New York Post speculated that the next “tipping point” would be the stars who still deny knowing anything, such as Matt Damon and George Clooney, who have pulled out of scheduled public appearances to promote their struggling movie Suburbicon.\\n\\n“Whom else does the industry know about and protect?” the editorial continued. “It’s hard to recall a time when the cultural landscape has shifted so dramatically. More than ever, the general public is inclined to believe self-reporting victims. More than ever, we are inclined to demand that the accused speak, that guilt be met with real consequence.”\\n\\nLeave a comment below, share your stories with emma.reynolds@news.com.au or tweet @emmareyn.\\n\\nOriginally published as Sordid rumours followed Kevin Spacey for years   \n",

Weinstein is expanding. In a new report today, The New York Times detailed allegations by four additional women dating back to the 1970s.\\n\\nActress Hope Exiter D’Amore alleges that Weinstein raped her in a hotel room when he was a young concert promoter in the 1970s. D’Amore, who was in her 20s at the time and working for Harvey and Corky Productions, Weinstein’s concert promotion business in Buffalo, NY. When Weinstein learned that she had an interest in film, she was invited and agreed to come to New York City to meet with some people in the industry.\\n\\nWhen she arrived at the Park Lane Hotel with Weinstein, he told her there had been a mistake with the reservation and they’d have to share a room. She told the Times she thought it was “ridiculous” but ultimately agreed. She alleges he slid into bed next to her naked and forced himself on her after she pushed him away and said no.\\n\\nAfter the New York trip, she says, Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her gifts and credits, but she was fired a few weeks later.\\n\\nCynthia Burr claims she had an encounter with Weinstein when she was in her 20s, also in the 1970s when she was working as an actress in New York. She alleges that Weinstein tried to kiss her in an elevator, then unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway. She told the paper that the incident made her feel ashamed, but said: “What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.”\\n\\nBurr went on to appear in Scarface and the first two Lethal Weapon movies, as well as doing TV work.\\n\\nAdditionally, dancer Ashley Matthau, who performed in Puerto Rico in the Weinstein-produced Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, alleged that in 2004, Weinstein shoved her onto a bed and masturbated on top her. She eventually reached a legal settlement with him. And Lacey Dorn, then 22 and a young documentary filmmaker, recalled meeting Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party. She alleges that he grabbed and groped her as he said goodbye to her. She told the Times she never heard from Weinstein or spoke with him again.\\n\\nThe new allegations follow the Times’ exposé three weeks ago detailing numerous claims of sexual harassment and misconduct against the once-powerful Hollywood mogul. That report was followed days later by a New Yorker article that included many more allegations from other women.   \n",

Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nWASHINGTON -- A former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, special counsel Robert Mueller said Monday, while former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manafort's business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the United States and other counts.\\n\\nThe guilty plea by former adviser George Papadopoulos marked the first criminal case that cites interactions between Trump campaign associates and Russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential campaign. The developments ushered Mueller's sprawling investigation into a new phase with felony charges and possible prison sentences for key members of the Trump team including Manafort, who led the campaign during critical months, and Rick Gates, a campaign aide.\\n\\nCourt papers also revealed that Papadopoulos was told about the Russians possessing \"dirt\" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" on April 26, 2016, well before it became public that the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails had been hacked.\\n\\nPapadopoulos has been cooperating with investigators, according to court papers, a potentially ominous sign for others in the Trump orbit who might be implicated by his statements.\\n\\nDuring the daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, saying it was \"extremely limited.\"\\n\\n\"He was not paid by the campaign,\" Sanders said, adding later: \"Any actions that he took would have been on his own.\"\\n\\nShe said the White House has had \"indications\" that Mueller's investigation would conclude \"soon.\"\\n\\nThe president quickly tweeted about the allegations against Manafort, saying the alleged crimes were \"years ago,\" and insisting there was \"NO COLLUSION\" between his campaign and Russia.\\n\\nHe added, as he has a number of times recently, \"Why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus--?\"\\n\\nManafort and Gates appeared in federal court in Washington and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\\n\\nPapadopoulos' plea occurred on Oct. 5 and was unsealed Monday. In court papers, he admitted lying to FBI agents about the nature of his interactions with \"foreign nationals\" who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials. Those interactions included speaking with Russian intermediaries who were attempting to line up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and offering \"dirt\" on Clinton.\\n\\nThe court filings don't provide details on the emails or whom Papadopoulos may have told about the Russian government effort.\\n\\nThe FBI interviewed Papadopoulos about his Russian connections on Jan. 27, a week after Trump's inauguration. The interview predates Mueller's appointment but was part of the FBI probe into Russian election interference that he has taken over.\\n\\nPapadopoulos was arrested over the summer at Dulles International Airport and has since met with the government \"on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions.\"\\n\\nThe separate charges against Manafort and Rick Gates contend the men acted as unregistered foreign agents for Ukrainian interests. The indictments also include other financial counts involving tens of millions of dollars routed through offshore accounts.\\n\\nManafort's indictment doesn't reference the Trump campaign or make any allegations about coordination between the Kremlin and the president's aides to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. The indictment does allege a criminal conspiracy was continuing through February of this year, after Trump had taken office.\\n\\nThe indictment filed in federal court in Washington accuses both Manafort and Gates of funneling payments through foreign companies and bank accounts as part of their political work in Ukraine. The two men surrendered to federal authorities Monday, and were expected in court later in the day to face the charges brought by Mueller's team.\\n\\nThe indictment lays out 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements and several charges related to failing to report foreign bank and financial accounts. The indictment alleges the men moved money through hidden bank accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Seychelles.\\n\\nIn total, more than $75 million flowed through the offshore accounts, according to the indictment. Manafort is accused of laundering more than $18 million.\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort did not immediately return calls or text messages requesting comment. Manafort and Gates have previously denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\nManafort, 68, was fired as Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The indictment against Manafort and Gates was largely based on activities disclosed in August 2016 by The Associated Press, which reported that the pair had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party.\\n\\nCiting internal emails, the AP noted that Gates personally directed the work of two prominent Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group. The indictment doesn't refer to the companies by name.\\n\\nSpecifically, the indictment accuses Manafort of using \"his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.\" That included using offshore accounts to purchase multimillion-dollar properties in the U.S., some of which the government is seeking to seize.\\n\\nMueller was appointed as special counsel in May to lead the Justice Department's investigation into whether the Kremlin worked with associates of the Trump campaign to tip the presidential election.\\n\\nThe appointment came one week after the firing of James Comey, who as FBI director led the investigation, and also followed the recusal months earlier of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the probe.\\n\\nManafort joined Trump's campaign in March 2016 and oversaw the Republican National Convention delegate strategy. Trump pushed him out in August amid a stream of negative headlines about Manafort's foreign consulting work.\\n\\nTrump's middle son, Eric Trump, said in an interview at the time that his father was concerned that questions about Manafort's past were taking attention away from the billionaire's presidential bid.\\n\\nManafort has been a subject of a longstanding FBI investigation into his dealings in Ukraine and work for the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. That investigation was incorporated into Mueller's broader probe. In July, his investigators raided one of Manafort's homes in Virginia, searching for tax and international banking records.\\n\\nPreviously, he denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it \"was totally open and appropriate.\"\\n\\nManafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgment that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law. The indictment Monday accuses Manafort and Gates of making several false and misleading statements in that FARA filing.\\n\\nMueller's investigation has also reached into the White House, as he examines the circumstances of Comey's firing. Investigators have requested extensive documents and have interviewed multiple current and former officials.\\n\\nMueller's grand jury has also heard testimony about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York attended by a Russian lawyer as well as Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\\n\\nIn Gates, Mueller brings in not just Manafort's chief deputy, but a key player from Trump's campaign who survived Manafort's ouster last summer. As of two weeks ago, Gates was still working for Tom Barrack, a Trump confidant, helping with the closeout of the inauguration committee's campaign account.   \n",

Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nPresident Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the U.S.\\n\\nWASHINGTON -- A former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians, special counsel Robert Mueller said Monday, while former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manafort's business partner pleaded not guilty to felony charges of conspiracy against the United States and other counts.\\n\\nThe guilty plea by former adviser George Papadopoulos marked the first criminal case that cites interactions between Trump campaign associates and Russian intermediaries during the 2016 presidential campaign. The developments ushered Mueller's sprawling investigation into a new phase with felony charges and possible prison sentences for key members of the Trump team including Manafort, who led the campaign during critical months, and Rick Gates, a campaign aide.\\n\\nCourt papers also revealed that Papadopoulos was told about the Russians possessing \"dirt\" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" on April 26, 2016, well before it became public that the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails had been hacked.\\n\\nPapadopoulos has been cooperating with investigators, according to court papers, a potentially ominous sign for others in the Trump orbit who might be implicated by his statements.\\n\\nDuring the daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders downplayed Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, saying it was \"extremely limited.\"\\n\\n\"He was not paid by the campaign,\" Sanders said, adding later: \"Any actions that he took would have been on his own.\"\\n\\nShe said the White House has had \"indications\" that Mueller's investigation would conclude \"soon.\"\\n\\nThe president quickly tweeted about the allegations against Manafort, saying the alleged crimes were \"years ago,\" and insisting there was \"NO COLLUSION\" between his campaign and Russia.\\n\\nHe added, as he has a number of times recently, \"Why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus--?\"\\n\\nManafort and Gates appeared in federal court in Washington and pleaded not guilty to all charges.\\n\\nPapadopoulos' plea occurred on Oct. 5 and was unsealed Monday. In court papers, he admitted lying to FBI agents about the nature of his interactions with \"foreign nationals\" who he thought had close connections to senior Russian government officials. Those interactions included speaking with Russian intermediaries who were attempting to line up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and offering \"dirt\" on Clinton.\\n\\nThe court filings don't provide details on the emails or whom Papadopoulos may have told about the Russian government effort.\\n\\nThe FBI interviewed Papadopoulos about his Russian connections on Jan. 27, a week after Trump's inauguration. The interview predates Mueller's appointment but was part of the FBI probe into Russian election interference that he has taken over.\\n\\nPapadopoulos was arrested over the summer at Dulles International Airport and has since met with the government \"on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions.\"\\n\\nThe separate charges against Manafort and Rick Gates contend the men acted as unregistered foreign agents for Ukrainian interests. The indictments also include other financial counts involving tens of millions of dollars routed through offshore accounts.\\n\\nManafort's indictment doesn't reference the Trump campaign or make any allegations about coordination between the Kremlin and the president's aides to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. The indictment does allege a criminal conspiracy was continuing through February of this year, after Trump had taken office.\\n\\nThe indictment filed in federal court in Washington accuses both Manafort and Gates of funneling payments through foreign companies and bank accounts as part of their political work in Ukraine. The two men surrendered to federal authorities Monday, and were expected in court later in the day to face the charges brought by Mueller's team.\\n\\nThe indictment lays out 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, making false statements and several charges related to failing to report foreign bank and financial accounts. The indictment alleges the men moved money through hidden bank accounts in Cyprus, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Seychelles.\\n\\nIn total, more than $75 million flowed through the offshore accounts, according to the indictment. Manafort is accused of laundering more than $18 million.\\n\\nA spokesman for Manafort did not immediately return calls or text messages requesting comment. Manafort and Gates have previously denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\nManafort, 68, was fired as Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The indictment against Manafort and Gates was largely based on activities disclosed in August 2016 by The Associated Press, which reported that the pair had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party.\\n\\nCiting internal emails, the AP noted that Gates personally directed the work of two prominent Washington lobbying firms, Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group. The indictment doesn't refer to the companies by name.\\n\\nSpecifically, the indictment accuses Manafort of using \"his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.\" That included using offshore accounts to purchase multimillion-dollar properties in the U.S., some of which the government is seeking to seize.\\n\\nMueller was appointed as special counsel in May to lead the Justice Department's investigation into whether the Kremlin worked with associates of the Trump campaign to tip the presidential election.\\n\\nThe appointment came one week after the firing of James Comey, who as FBI director led the investigation, and also followed the recusal months earlier of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the probe.\\n\\nManafort joined Trump's campaign in March 2016 and oversaw the Republican National Convention delegate strategy. Trump pushed him out in August amid a stream of negative headlines about Manafort's foreign consulting work.\\n\\nTrump's middle son, Eric Trump, said in an interview at the time that his father was concerned that questions about Manafort's past were taking attention away from the billionaire's presidential bid.\\n\\nManafort has been a subject of a longstanding FBI investigation into his dealings in Ukraine and work for the country's former president, Viktor Yanukovych. That investigation was incorporated into Mueller's broader probe. In July, his investigators raided one of Manafort's homes in Virginia, searching for tax and international banking records.\\n\\nPreviously, he denied any wrongdoing related to his Ukrainian work, saying through a spokesman that it \"was totally open and appropriate.\"\\n\\nManafort also recently registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for parts of Ukrainian work that occurred in Washington. The filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act came retroactively, a tacit acknowledgment that he operated in Washington in violation of the federal transparency law. The indictment Monday accuses Manafort and Gates of making several false and misleading statements in that FARA filing.\\n\\nMueller's investigation has also reached into the White House, as he examines the circumstances of Comey's firing. Investigators have requested extensive documents and have interviewed multiple current and former officials.\\n\\nMueller's grand jury has also heard testimony about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York attended by a Russian lawyer as well as Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\\n\\nIn Gates, Mueller brings in not just Manafort's chief deputy, but a key player from Trump's campaign who survived Manafort's ouster last summer. As of two weeks ago, Gates was still working for Tom Barrack, a Trump confidant, helping with the closeout of the inauguration committee's campaign account.   \n",

Trump associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and the guilty plea from former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, have brought the three men into the national spotlight. While Manafort has been known in the political world during his two months as campaign manager for President Donald Trump last year, Gates and Papadopoulos weren't the most well-known names until news of the Manafort-Gates indictment broke Monday morning. Paul ManafortManafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March of 2016, and by June, he became manager. However, two months later, Manafort resigned as campaign manager. Manafort and Gates, longtime business associates who served together on the Trump campaign, were the first two officials indicted Monday in connection with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, on 12 counts that included conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money and unregistered agent of a foreign principal.The charges do not cover any activities related to the campaign, though it's possible Mueller could add additional charges.Rick GatesGates served as Manafort's deputy during his tenure as Trump campaign manager. Gates stayed on the campaign after Manafort was ousted amid questions about his work in Ukraine. But Gates was ousted from a pro-Trump advocacy group earlier this year amid mounting questions about Manafort.When Gates joined Manafort's lobbying firm in the mid-2000s, they worked for former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russia Party of Regions.Manafort's firm first came under scrutiny from US investigators in 2014, when they sought to determine whether his and other Washington-based lobbying firms failed to register as foreign agents for the Yanukovych regime.Gates has previously denied any wrongdoing. \"Everything was done legally and with the approval of our lawyers,\" Gates said in a June interview with The New York Times. \"Nothing to my knowledge was ever done inappropriately.\"George PapadopoulosPapadopoulos, a former policy adviser to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to making false statements to FBI agents. According to court documents, Papadopoulos allegedly made a \"false, fictitious and fraudulent\" statement about the timing and extent of his relationships with foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior officials in the Russian government.In recently unsealed court records, the FBI said Papadopoulos \"falsely described his interactions with a certain foreign contact who discussed 'dirt' related to emails\" concerning Hillary Clinton.Papadopoulos was an adviser to Ben Carson's presidential campaign, before he transitioned to the Trump team in May 2016.CNN contributed to this report.\\n\\nThe indictments against former Trump associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and the guilty plea from former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, have brought the three men into the national spotlight.

Manafort's firm first came under scrutiny from US investigators in 2014, when they sought to determine whether his and other Washington-based lobbying firms failed to register as foreign agents for the Yanukovych regime. Gates has previously denied any wrongdoing. \"Everything was done legally and with the approval of our lawyers,\" Gates said in a June interview with The New York Times. \"Nothing to my knowledge was ever done inappropriately.\" Papadopoulos, a former policy adviser to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to making false statements to FBI agents. According to court documents, Papadopoulos allegedly made a \"false, fictitious and fraudulent\" statement about the timing and extent of his relationships with foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior officials in the Russian government. In recently unsealed court records, the FBI said Papadopoulos \"falsely described his interactions with a certain foreign contact who discussed 'dirt' related to emails\" concerning Hillary Clinton.\\n\\n Papadopoulos was an adviser to Ben Carson's presidential campaign, before he transitioned to the Trump team in May 2016.   \n",

       "7146  Ed. Note: This article is the latest in our series on the U.S. Supreme Court case Jesner v. Arab Bank, a case that is slated to resolve the question of whether corporations can be sued under international law for human rights violations and terrorism. Oral arguments were held October 11th.\\n\\nFurther to our previous coverage of the oral arguments (transcript is here) in Jesner v. Arab Bank (see Bill Dodge’s terrific contribution followed by Ed Swaine’s elaboration), below I summarize, Justice-by-Justice, some of the key issues raised by Supreme Court and the responses of the parties’ lawyers and the United States government as amicus curiae.\\n\\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor evinced a very sophisticated understanding of international law with her questions. She pushed former Solicitor General Paul Clement, representing the Arab Bank, hard on the question of whether or not it was necessary for plaintiffs to affirmatively demonstrate the existence of an international norm for holding corporations civilly liable for human rights abuses and terrorism. She turned the question on its head a bit when she asked if it was also necessary to demonstrate the existence of an international norm allowing for natural persons to be civilly liable, which is exactly what the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) accomplishes. Clement did not have a ready response and simply returned to the defendants’ common reframe that international law speaks to the question of who or what kind of actor can violate international law.\\n\\nTo Assistant Solicitor General Brian Fletcher, representing the United States on behalf of neither party, Justice Sotomayor asked about whether the United States should in fact be worried about the foreign policy implications of such suits, as defendants argue. Fletcher responded that the way to deal with any risk of foreign entanglement is through undertaking the extraterritoriality analysis called for by Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum. He also noted that there may be similar foreign policy implications for suits involving corporate officers and principals, which would presumably replace suits against the corporate entity itself if the Court rules for defendants in Jesner. So, limiting the ATS to suits against natural persons will not eliminate these concerns. To Clement, she queried whether any potential friction with the state of Jordan would be lessened by suits brought under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) as compared with suits under the ATS? Clement responded that under the ATS, the defendant is labeled a hostis humani generis—enemy of all mankind—a sobriquet that would be of greater concern than being considered a financière of terrorism.\\n\\nWhen Clement tried to point out that none of the international tribunals allows for corporate criminal liability, Justice Sotomayor stated the obvious: that criminal law is different from civil law. Invoking an amicus brief by comparative law scholars and practitioners, she noted that many nations hold corporations civilly liable for international law breaches under a range of mechanisms and theories of liability. Under her approach, the Court should look to this general state practice to determine what the applicable international norm is.\\n\\nChief Justice John Roberts wanted to know whether the ATS was a unique remedy internationally. This question gave plaintiffs’ counsel Jeff Fisher of Stanford Law an opportunity to explain the plaintiffs’ position, which is that international law contains substantive rules, but leaves many details of its enforcement to individual states based upon the particularities of their diverse legal cultures and frameworks. Fisher pointed to the comparative scholars brief for examples of the ways in which different domestic systems have dealt with corporate breaches of international law. He conceded that the ATS is a unique feature of U.S. federalism and reflects a desire of the founders to keep international law cases out of state courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction.\\n\\nTo the U.S. government, Chief Justice Roberts wanted to know who would hold the United States accountable if we did not provide a forum and a remedy for such cases. He asked: Isn’t it the case that other nations are actually annoyed that we are providing a remedy? Fletcher again indicated that any such concerns should be dealt with on remand when the parties can fully brief the extraterritoriality issue.\\n\\nJustice Samuel Alito focused in on the norm-identification process long established by Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, which requires courts to consider whether the plaintiff has alleged an established rule of international law. In what he described as step 2 of this analysis, this inquiry inevitably involves “an element of judgment about the practical consequences of making that cause available to litigants in the federal courts,” including the international repercussions of allowing the suit. Fisher agreed, but also pointed to a number of other doctrines available to deal with these contingencies, including extraterritoriality, foreign non-conveniens, political question, comity, etc. He argued that there is a mismatch between these concerns and the categorical rule of corporate immunity sought by defendants.\\n\\nJustice Alito was skeptical about whether or not denying an alien plaintiff a remedy for international law harms would itself have foreign policy implications. He queried whether there were other grounds to bring suit against U.S. corporations that breach international law, implying that United States does not need the ATS to carry out any remedial obligations under international law.\\n\\nThe application of the presumption against extraterritoriality came up several times during the argument, even though this issue is technically not before the Court and has not yet been fully briefed by parties. For example, Justice Alito asked whether the presumption against extraterritoriality would apply where there are transactions in the United States. Plaintiffs’ counsel insisted that this issue is not before the Court, but then explained that, in any case, such transactions are not a de minimis function; they are actually core to the international financial system as explained in the brief by experts on financial regulation. Mirroring the thrust of its brief, see Zach Kaufman’s coverage here, the government raised extraterritoriality in its opening and closing remarks, arguing that the categorical rule of corporate immunity relied upon by the Second Circuit in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum (Kiobel I) is the wrong one, but that the lower courts should look closely at whether the case sufficiently touches and concerns the United States to displace the presumption.\\n\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch was quite fixated on a 2011 law review article suggesting that the ATS was drafted in order to address situations in which the defendant hails from the United States (Bill Dodge has refuted these arguments here). The theory is that the founders wanted to avoid giving just cause for war against the United States. Putting aside the fact that nothing in the text of the Statute suggests this limitation, Fisher countered that what little history we do have on the ATS belies this theory. Rather, extensive historical research has confirmed that the 1784 Marbois-Longchamps affair, which involved two foreigners, inspired the ATS. In any case, Fisher noted that these issues were hashed out in Sosa and were definitively rejected, and all the recent cases before the Court involve aliens on both sides. At one point, Justice Sotomayor interjected to remind her colleague that the ATS clearly would have applied to piracy, which would not fit this revisionist paradigm or raise any foreign policy concerns. (So odd was this this line of questioning that one press account described it as “Gorsuch’s strange detour”).\\n\\nJustice Gorsuch suggested that cases involving ambassadors could be dealt with under the specific ambassadors clause of the Constitution. Or, they could be dealt with under federal question jurisdiction (§1331). Fisher noted, however, that one function of the ATS is to direct such cases to a federal forum.\\n\\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in connection with Justice Gorsuch’s line of questioning, reminded the participants that the Court has already held that international law is part of U.S. law. She asked the question of why international law would make a distinction between individual and corporate perpetrators? She observed that the major split within international law is between norms that require a showing of state action as an element of the offense (e.g., the conventional prohibition against torture, which requires a showing that the prohibited acts are “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity”) and those that apply equally (or predominantly as is the case with piracy) to private actors.\\n\\nShe was skeptical about whether the Court needed to find an affirmative rule addressed to corporations that would draw an artificial line between individuals and legal entities. She also opined that this is a question of remedy, which national law should supply. Clement tried to argue that there is in fact a big difference in how international law deals with natural persons vice corporate entities, citing the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) and the work of the international criminal tribunals since Nuremberg. Justice Ginsburg noted, however, that while international law may permit certain forms of redress, the U.S. Congress can decide not to extend liability to corporations, which it did in the TVPA.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg also invoked the Restatement, which recognizes corporate liability for international law violations. Clement responded that this text is not at the level of specificity required by Sosa. She noted that the United States had already sanctioned the Bank for its conduct. Clement responded that this is how these cases should be dealt with, not under the ATS.\\n\\nJustice Elena Kagan also pursued this line of argument and wanted to know if it would be better to deal with these cases through the creation and enforcement of financial regulations rather than through private litigation. Fisher noted that the allegations here are not about simple negligent oversight; rather, the Bank was affirmatively funding acts of terrorism against U.S. citizens and the citizens of our allies. These allegations were proven in the ATA wing of the case and resulted in a significant money damage award for the plaintiffs.\\n\\nJustice Kagan posed a weighty hypothetical: what about a United States corporation that is using alien slave labor under circumstances that pose no extraterritoriality concerns—should there be no liability under the ATS even though the law would normally provide a tort remedy for such corporate malfeasance? (This case is not a mere hypothetical, similar allegations arise in Doe v. Nestlé USA, which involves allegations that the company uses child slave labor to harvest cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire). Clement conceded that this is a difficult set of facts, but returned to the solution of simply suing the responsible corporate principals. When Justice Kagan raised concerns about judgment-proof defendants and noted that victims are more likely to get a meaningful remedy against the corporation itself, Clement argued rather lamely that (to paraphrase) “middle managers make good money.” When Justice Alito noted that the hypothetical would also give rise to potential felony liability, Justice Kagan retorted that victims would also be entitled to compensation, which would aide in their rehabilitation.\\n\\nJustice Kagan wanted to know when other governments might take offense if the United States did not provide a remedy. Fletcher noted that the “heartland” of situations to be addressed by the ATS involved foreign citizens injured by international law violations in the United States, like the Marbois incident. Justice Kagan questioned whether a foreign government that might take offense at the filing of a suit here would necessarily care whether that suit was brought against a natural person or a legal entity. In Fletcher’s estimation, to remove liability for a corporation and disallow an ordinary tort remedy that would otherwise exist might equally raise objections.\\n\\nIn this exchange, Justice Kagan raised an interesting issue that has not received a lot of attention: what should be the scope of corporate liability assuming there is no categorical bar? Would there be full respondent superior or would the corporation be amenable to suit only if there was a corporate policy involved? It was noted that Judge Posner in Flomo v. Firestone Natural Rubber Co. LLC would require a high level of accountability, in part to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality, similar to how the Court limited municipal liability in Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York. In response, Fletcher replied that all the Court needs to do is reject the categorical bar; it need not announce any particular standard at this time. On this line of argument, Clement pointed out that the 1999 Terrorist Financing Convention at Article V only require the imposition of liability on someone in a control or management position who violates Article II.\\n\\nTo Clement, Justice Kagan pointed out that a universal standard of conduct is needed under Sosa, not a universal enforcement mechanism. International law does not require states to enact a provision similar to the ATS, but nothing in international law would prohibit states from following suit. If allowing a case to proceed under the ATS might have foreign affairs consequences, this should be dealt during the Sosa analysis.\\n\\nJustice Anthony Kennedy stayed focused on the core question: does Sosa require plaintiffs to show that international law affirmatively recognizes a cause of action against corporations for international law violations? He insisted that this part of the conduct-regulating norm (as opposed to an ancillary or derivative inquiry addressed to modes of enforcement) since it would dictate standards of behavior to corporations. Fisher disagreed, indicating that the question of who could be sued and under what theory are elements of enforcement, but not core to identifying the scope of the norm itself. He took this occasion to remind the Court that this has been the consistent position of the U.S. government over two administrations.\\n\\nJustice Stephen Breyer reasoned that Sosa and the treaties address both persons and entities. He noted that the United States did sign the Terrorist Financing Convention and implemented it by passing the ATA. The Convention obliges states party to provide a remedy when legal entities located in their territories or organized under their laws fund terrorism, and that this obligation has been reinforced by the Security Council in Resolution 1373, passed just following the attacks of September 11th. Later, Clement pointed out that are 6 treaties that directly impose civil liability on corporate entities; these are listed in footnote 40 of Judge Cabranes’s Kiobel I opinion (e.g. the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage). The United States, however, has not ratified any of them. But, Justice Breyer noted, if there is a rule against financing terrorism, it must apply to corporations or it would have little impact other than with respect to a few depraved billionaires. Clement argued that plaintiffs bear the burden of showing the existence of an applicable norm and that the terrorism treaties do not provide such a norm. Even the Terrorist Financing Convention treats corporations separately and does not impose duties directly on them, but rather on states parties to the treaty. The United States, for example, limited the remedy under the ATA to U.S. citizens—this is entirely understandable in Clement’s mind, because we have a special relationship with our citizens.\\n\\nA couple of small issues also made cameo appearances. Justice Sotomayor asked about the Court’s new rules governing personal jurisdiction over corporations under Daimler Chrysler AG v. Bauman. Fisher noted that Daimler covers cases involving the exercise of general jurisdiction over corporations and requires them to be sued at the principal place of business or headquarters. The case at bar, by contrast, is a specific jurisdiction case involving actions taken in New York, the forum state.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg asked whether U.S. courts should impose or recognize an exhaustion of local remedies requirement as suggested in footnote 21 in Sosa. Plaintiff’s counsel explained that there was no viable alternative forum in Jordan. Plus, the ATS claims on behalf of alien plaintiffs proceeded in combination with ATA claims on behalf of U.S. citizens, so efficiency dictated that it made sense to bring the entire suit in one forum given the common nucleus of operative facts.   \n",

                             We are artists, arts administrators, assistants, curators, directors, editors, educators, gallerists, interns, scholars, students, writers, and more ― workers of the art world ― and we have been groped, undermined, harassed, infantilized, scorned, threatened, and intimidated by those in positions of power who control access to resources and opportunities. We have held our tongues, threatened by power wielded over us and promises of institutional access and career advancement. We are not surprised when curators offer exhibitions or support in exchange for sexual favors. We are not surprised when gallerists romanticize, minimize, and hide sexually abusive behavior by artists they represent. We are not surprised when a meeting with a collector or a potential patron becomes a sexual proposition. We are not surprised when we are retaliated against for not complying. We are not surprised when Knight Landesman gropes us in the art fair booth while promising he’ll help us with our career. Abuse of power comes as no surprise.\\n\\nThe letter was drafted following reports that former co-publisher of ArtForum magazine Knight Landesman has allegedly sexually harassed various women over the course of a decade, promising career advancement in exchange for their silence and acquiescence. Of course, Landesman is only one player in a competitive culture where powerful, white men ― whether artists, dealers, curators, publishers or collectors ― function as gatekeepers who can “make or break” the young and vulnerable.\\n\\nI’m sick of sitting through painful moments where an older man is outwardly commenting on my appearance or asking questions about my sexual preferences, putting his hand on my leg or lower back, and being told to laugh off revolting advances by someone who could be my grandfather, all because they are a “really good collector.” I’m sick of my artwork and my self being infantilized and sexualized during studio visits, dinners, at art fairs and openings, meanwhile male figurative artists are celebrated, revered and valued more than female artists, even if their content is completely sexual and misogynistic in nature. My main frustration is the insidious nature of these kinds of abuse, because so many men are able to look at these stories and feel as though they have nothing to do with it, because as far as they know, they’ve never physically abused a woman. The issue here is not solely physical sexual abuse or assault, but rather the subtle and constant way that women are consistently pushed down and made silent, in a manner that is so entrenched and normalized that it does not even register as an offense to most men. I hope that the more we come together to support each other and share stories and outline the problems, the more men will be able to pinpoint and identify their involvement and complacency, take accountability for their behaviors and make real change moving forward.\\n\\nMira Schor, also based in New York, reiterated a hope that the open letter will necessitate a shift in the industry. “I hope that it will help lead to positive changes in art world institutions and practices, particularly in empowering women to speak their mind and follow their intellectual and aesthetic passions and talents without unnecessary impediments caused by gender prejudice and either every day or unusually repellent sexual harassment or abuse,” she wrote.\\n\\n“Institutions might change if these women in the arts were raised to a bigger level of responsibility,” she said, “so that what they think is important, what they are aware of, what they bother to respect, might be given room at the top of the institution. I think this might help change the culture of these work places.”\\n\\n“I am hoping that some [institutions] will implement stronger policies to protect employees,” she said. “The bigger problem though is that the art world is for the most part an unregulated industry. Much of the business happens in social settings and one-on-one. It’s hard to control people’s behavior in those contexts. Powerful art dealers and independent superstar curators and millionaire artists are not subject to employee regulations the way one might be at a museum.\\n\\nThere is no single person or issue at the root of the sexual mistreatment that plagues the art world. Rather, a complex networks of power imbalance, wealth inequality, misogyny and lack of regulation make it so. An open letter won’t solve all the art world’s problems, but it can announce a new normal, where acts of discrimination, abuse and condescension will no longer be ignored.   \n",
