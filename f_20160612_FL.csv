This Father's Day, and the many others to come, are going to be painful.

Larry Edwards, a former Florida A&M University student, left to work at the Cadillac Ranch restaurant in Kendall on Tuesday. He finished work late and stopped to hang out with a couple of friends early Wednesday morning.

The 32-year-old never made it back home to his daughters.

Someone used a high-powered rifle to shoot at him and his friends at an apartment complex in South Miami's largely African-American neighborhood, where gun violence and poverty are still part of the city's painful history of segregation.

There was outrage after his death. Edwards was known in the neighborhood as a hardworking family man. Police have yet to catch his killer.

""I can't sleep,"" Edwards said on an early morning June 5th post on Facebook.

In May, he said, ""21 hours overtime in one week $$$$."" And in April, he said, ""Finally, I get to relax, long shifts.""

Edwards had just celebrated his eldest daughter's 5th grade graduation and he was proud. He loved to take them shopping and when he got them both mobile phones in January, he said, ""Now they better call daddy every day.""

His friend Virgil James said, ""Daddy Little Girls.""

A day after he died, Lori Ann Ealey went back to the post. The girls were holding up their new cell phones. But they won't be able to call him anymore.

""This picture really brings me to tears,"" she said.

Ealey is not alone in her pain. The City of South Miami will be co-hosting a town hall meeting to discuss gun violence on Tuesday night. There will be a 6 p.m. memorial where Edwards was killed at Southwest 59 Place and 67 Street. The town hall will be at 7 p.m at the St. John A.M.E.

Bob Poe, who is running for Florida’s 10th district congressional seat, released a video on Facebook Thursday saying he was diagnosed 18 years ago, but he’s “perfectly healthy.”

He shared a story about meeting someone in his state who was also HIV-positive.

“…I ran into somebody in the community a few weeks back, let’s call her Linda, and Linda told me that she had been recently diagnosed with HIV and she thought she had a death sentence,” Poe said. “I told her that she didn’t, and even shared with her where she could go to get the resources that she needed. But I really just wanted to hug her, and let her know that she wasn’t alone. Because I too had HIV.”

He talked about the “fear and the stigma that surrounds this condition” as a reason why he wasn’t upfront with the woman about it.

“So now it’s time to come out and share this with you publicly so that we can begin to have this discussion and remove the fear and the stigma and the shame that goes with this,” he said.

“If you want to make a difference, you have to be the difference,” he added.","[""iStock/Thinkstock(ORLANDO, Fla.) -- A Florida congressional candidate revealed this week that he is HIV-positive.

(WTXL) - Talks continue this weekend at Florida A & M University, as the board of trustees holds a summit to discuss strategies for the upcoming school year.

FAMU officials spent Saturday morning in a training workshop focusing on why rallying around the president is so important. Dr. Elmira Mangum's performance has recently been under the scope. In fact last year she was nearly forced out by trustees. Earlier this week a local pastor sent a letter to officials asking them not to renew her contract.

On Friday, trustees voted to delay that decision so that they could analyze her performance, but R.B. Holmes says either way, it's time for change. Mangum supporters also attended the talks and say its way too soon to ask for change.

June 30th is the deadline for the trustees to declare their intentions on the contract. Since their next meeting isn't until September, it's unclear how the delay will affect the discussion. If no decision is made, then Mangum must leave by the end of April.","TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

Jeff Morris, a Democrat, and Joyce Peppin, a Republican, are elected representatives at the state level, the equivalent of Members of the Legislative Assembly here. Their presidential election race is hogging headlines globally, what with the shenanigans of Republican candidate Donald Trump (there are hoardings of him up in Mumbai at this moment) and the clashes in the Democrat party between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

Who becomes US president is a matter of interest and concern to the whole world. It is, after all, the world’s sole superpower. The visiting US politicians offered some clues on the way the race is going.

A coalition of people who feel disenfranchised have powered Bernie Sanders, according to the Democrat from Washington, Mr Morris. A similar group of blue-collar workers and the unemployed is powering Trump, he reckons. He sees Trump’s rise to the Republican nomination as akin to a hostile takeover of that party. This is not refuted by the Minnesota Republican, Ms Peppin, who says she had supported Marco Rubio for the nomination. She is uncomfortable with Trump’s position on several issues, and says people are waiting for him to step away from the theatrical and start talking about actual policy.

There are strong constituencies against Trump and Hillary Clinton, Mr Morris points out. The pressure from Sanders has pushed Clinton towards the Left, according to Ms Peppin, and she suspects that many Sanders supporters may not come out to vote at all if Clinton tries to move away from their positions on issues.

So which way is it going to go

Well, the elections themselves are in November, which is still some way off. Before that, the candidates will have to try and consolidate the different strands of their respective parties behind themselves.

At some point, the choice will come down to two candidates, and voters will have to choose one of the two, Ms Peppin says. She reckons that Trump has a chance, though she feels Rubio would have been a stronger candidate against Hillary.

Nonetheless, the parties will work for their respective nominees in the end, she says.

The fact that Trump is not a career politician helps him to an extent, according to Ms Peppin. Trump’s background as a “somewhat successful” businessman has also boosted his chances, Mr Morris says, but at some point people are going to start asking him how he proposes to get to the outcomes he has been talking about. For instance, how will be build that wall on the border with Mexico

“He will build the wall and send the bill to Mexico. Simple”, jokes Ms Peppin.

It’s possible that many of the less thoughtful voters in the US may not be too interested in the details anyway.

The US famously has “Red states” which traditionally vote Republican, and “Blue states” that traditionally vote Democrat. There are also a few “Purple states” that have mixed voting records. The state of Minnesota where Ms Peppin is the House majority leader – the equivalent of the leader of the majority party in a state legislature in India – is one that votes Republican at the local level and Democrat at the national level. It is, in that sense, a “Purple” state.

The American presidential election is an indirect one, somewhat like the Indian presidential election. Each state has a certain number of electors who represent the state in the presidential poll. The key difference with India is that all the electors of a given state go to the winning candidate. For instance, California has 55 electors. If Hillary wins California by even one vote, all the 55 seats go in her kitty.

The halfway mark is 270 seats. There are relatively fewer Blue states; most of America other than the east and west coast are at present Red states, or swing states. However, California, on the US west coast, traditionally a Blue state, has way more seats than any other state — 55. Texas, the biggest Red state, is second with 38. The third big state that has a clear preference is New York on the east coast with 29 seats. It’s also a Blue state.

The Democrats will therefore start the race with an advantage. Even though they have fewer states, those states have more electoral college seats. Trump will have to come from behind and win the swing states, which are not committed either way, in order to win. The biggest of these is Florida with 29 seats, which had brought George W. Bush – in a disputed vote – to power in 2000. In the last two elections, the state has voted for the Democrat nominee and incumbent president, Barack Obama. The contest in Florida this time around is fairly evenly poised, according to analysis by statistician Nate Silver’s organisation FiveThirtyEight published December 2015, which gave a 1 percent lead to Hillary over Trump in the state at that time.

The electoral outcome will be decided by what the candidates do in the months from now until November. Hillary Clinton seems to be ahead, but not by much, and if Trump is able to close the gap, the final result may well depend on what is in the news in the days leading up to the vote, and which party is able to get more of its supporters to cast their ballots on voting day.

There is a chance that Trump may knock himself out before that by shooting his mouth off once too often, or some explosive new revelation may torpedo Hillary. If both candidates are left standing till the end, this election may go down to the wire.

At present, the possibility of a Trump presidency cannot be dismissed.","Last week, just around the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi was making his feted and celebrated visit to the United States of America, a couple of politicians from that country happened to be in Mumb"

Jeff Morris, a Democrat, and Joyce Peppin, a Republican, are elected representatives at the state level, the equivalent of Members of the Legislative Assembly here. Their presidential election race is hogging headlines globally, what with the shenanigans of Republican candidate Donald Trump (there are hoardings of him up in Mumbai at this moment) and the clashes in the Democrat party between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

Who becomes US president is a matter of interest and concern to the whole world. It is, after all, the world’s sole superpower. The visiting US politicians offered some clues on the way the race is going.

A coalition of people who feel disenfranchised have powered Bernie Sanders, according to the Democrat from Washington, Mr Morris. A similar group of blue-collar workers and the unemployed is powering Trump, he reckons. He sees Trump’s rise to the Republican nomination as akin to a hostile takeover of that party. This is not refuted by the Minnesota Republican, Ms Peppin, who says she had supported Marco Rubio for the nomination. She is uncomfortable with Trump’s position on several issues, and says people are waiting for him to step away from the theatrical and start talking about actual policy.

There are strong constituencies against Trump and Hillary Clinton, Mr Morris points out. The pressure from Sanders has pushed Clinton towards the Left, according to Ms Peppin, and she suspects that many Sanders supporters may not come out to vote at all if Clinton tries to move away from their positions on issues.

So which way is it going to go

Well, the elections themselves are in November, which is still some way off. Before that, the candidates will have to try and consolidate the different strands of their respective parties behind themselves.

At some point, the choice will come down to two candidates, and voters will have to choose one of the two, Ms Peppin says. She reckons that Trump has a chance, though she feels Rubio would have been a stronger candidate against Hillary.

Nonetheless, the parties will work for their respective nominees in the end, she says.

The fact that Trump is not a career politician helps him to an extent, according to Ms Peppin. Trump’s background as a “somewhat successful” businessman has also boosted his chances, Mr Morris says, but at some point people are going to start asking him how he proposes to get to the outcomes he has been talking about. For instance, how will be build that wall on the border with Mexico

“He will build the wall and send the bill to Mexico. Simple”, jokes Ms Peppin.

It’s possible that many of the less thoughtful voters in the US may not be too interested in the details anyway.

The US famously has “Red states” which traditionally vote Republican, and “Blue states” that traditionally vote Democrat. There are also a few “Purple states” that have mixed voting records. The state of Minnesota where Ms Peppin is the House majority leader – the equivalent of the leader of the majority party in a state legislature in India – is one that votes Republican at the local level and Democrat at the national level. It is, in that sense, a “Purple” state.

The American presidential election is an indirect one, somewhat like the Indian presidential election. Each state has a certain number of electors who represent the state in the presidential poll. The key difference with India is that all the electors of a given state go to the winning candidate. For instance, California has 55 electors. If Hillary wins California by even one vote, all the 55 seats go in her kitty.

The halfway mark is 270 seats. There are relatively fewer Blue states; most of America other than the east and west coast are at present Red states, or swing states. However, California, on the US west coast, traditionally a Blue state, has way more seats than any other state — 55. Texas, the biggest Red state, is second with 38. The third big state that has a clear preference is New York on the east coast with 29 seats. It’s also a Blue state.

The Democrats will therefore start the race with an advantage. Even though they have fewer states, those states have more electoral college seats. Trump will have to come from behind and win the swing states, which are not committed either way, in order to win. The biggest of these is Florida with 29 seats, which had brought George W. Bush – in a disputed vote – to power in 2000. In the last two elections, the state has voted for the Democrat nominee and incumbent president, Barack Obama. The contest in Florida this time around is fairly evenly poised, according to analysis by statistician Nate Silver’s organisation FiveThirtyEight published December 2015, which gave a 1 percent lead to Hillary over Trump in the state at that time.

The electoral outcome will be decided by what the candidates do in the months from now until November. Hillary Clinton seems to be ahead, but not by much, and if Trump is able to close the gap, the final result may well depend on what is in the news in the days leading up to the vote, and which party is able to get more of its supporters to cast their ballots on voting day.

There is a chance that Trump may knock himself out before that by shooting his mouth off once too often, or some explosive new revelation may torpedo Hillary. If both candidates are left standing till the end, this election may go down to the wire.

At present, the possibility of a Trump presidency cannot be dismissed.","Last week, just around the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi was making his feted and celebrated visit to the United States of America, a couple of politicians from that country happened to be in Mumb"

RALEIGH (WTVD) -- Glenwood Avenue in downtown was packed with people as Slide the City returned to Raleigh.

The movable water attraction is like a giant Slip N' Slide and the event travels across the nation in cities and towns.

Despite the hot day, if you ask anyone how they were feeling, you'll get an answer like Bella Dickenson's: ""It was great! The city's amazing!""

""I've been on a couple of water slides before,"" he told ABC11. ""Nothing this long!""

Some fans follow the event across the country like Jonathan Welker.

""Gotten to Knoxville, Florida, Georgia, Virginia,"" he said. ""It's just a fun event!""

Danielle Hobbs came for a second try after missing out on the attraction's 2015 debut in Raleigh.

""Yep! Been wanting to come last year, but couldn't make it,"" she said. ""It's actually really fun! I was kind of surprised!""

Devon Schumann's a fan who drove to Raleigh from Chapel Hill, packing ""big floats, a bathing suit, some sunscreen, maybe a shot of tequila!""

That sunscreen proved vitally important when the sun was shining as much as it was on Saturday. Sunglasses certainly helped too.

Those who've experienced both events say the 2016 watery track is great on a day they'll remember.

""Amazing! The weather's great, it's not too hot yet. We're gonna have fun!"" said slider Mark Wah.",Glenwood Avenue in downtown was packed with people as Slide the City returned to Raleigh.

PETERSBURG, Florida: Gawker Media LLC, an online publishing pioneer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put itself up for sale on Friday after a $140 million court judgment against it in a lawsuit brought by former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan over a sex tape. The move followed revelations that Hogan’s lawsuit, along with several others against Gawker, were being bankrolled by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, an early backer of Facebook and a co-founder of PayPal.

Thiel’s involvement, which stemmed from his ire over Gawker’s writings about him and his friends in Silicon Valley, raised alarm bells in US media circles over the prospect of wealthy individuals using the courts to muzzle the press.

Gawker vowed to continue operating its seven websites during the bankruptcy process. Media company Ziff Davis LLC has entered an agreement to buy Gawker’s assets for a little less than $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter, but that may be only the initial bid in a court-supervised auction likely to take place at the end of July.

“Even with his billions, Thiel will not silence our writers,” Gawker founder and Chief Executive Nick Denton said on Twitter. “Our sites will thrive — under new ownership — and we’ll win in court.”

Hogan’s lawsuit accused Gawker, Denton and former Gawker editor A.J. Daulerio of violating his privacy by publishing a one minute, 41-second edited video clip featuring Hogan with the wife of his then-best friend, the radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.

In March, a six-person jury awarded $60 million to Hogan, 62, for emotional distress and $55 million for economic damages. The jury then added another $25 million in punitive damages.","NEW YORK/ST.

Addressing a crowd of thousands at the Tampa Convention Center, Trump tore into “Crooked Hillary,” as he calls his likely general election opponent, over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. He called Romney a “stone, cold loser” for not backing him as the presumptive Republican nominee.

Trump said the Republican Party “has got to get their act together, come together to win.” He slammed Republicans in the U.S. Senate who oppose his candidacy.

He spoke confidently of his own ability to win the presidency, but warned that Republican seats in the House and Senate could be at risk if Republicans don’t rally behind him.

“The Republican party has to be tough and smart,” he said. “If not, I’m gonna win but a lot of other people are not.”

Trump was introduced by Florida’s top Republicans, Gov. Rick Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

“Donald Trump is hopeful,” said Scott, whose support of Trump has generated running mate speculation. “The opposite of hopeful is Hillary Clinton.”

Trump, at one point, asked the crowd to shout out names of potential running mates. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, were among the names he repeated.

“This is fun,” bellowed Trump. “We have a lot of good people.”

Toward the end of his speech, Trump supporters broke into a chorus of “Happy Birthday.” He turns 70-years old on June 14.

As his supporters began singing, Trump laughed and said “I don’t want to hear about it.”

He said he’s “very torn” about the birthday, but added: “I feel like I’m 35. That’s the good news.”

The bear was tranquilized, then taken from the development near Beach and Hodges Boulevards and released unharmed in natural habitat at Camp Blanding in southwest Clay County. It was among four bears reported during a three-day period in Clay or Duval residential areas from June 2-4.

Among them was about a 150-pound bear that snacked on seeds from bird feeders and batted a hanging flower basket while ambling through Green Cove Springs backyards for two days before heading into nearby woods. Two other bears were seen in separate incidents June 4 in Oakleaf Plantation and near Branan Field - both in northern Clay County. No injures either to people or bears were reported.

Such incidents and others like them statewide are almost certain to be at the forefront of contentious discussion in 10 days when the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considers whether to authorize a statewide bear hunt this fall.

Agency wildlife biologists are recommending that a more conservative hunt be held compared to last year's, which triggered lingering controversy pitting animal welfare advocates against hunters. However, biologists also issued three other options Friday, including either postponing the bear hunt until next year, or once again banning bear hunting altogether in Florida.

Bear sightings aren't science. They shouldn't be used to determine whether Florida has too many bears, or to justify another hunt, said Kate MacFall, Florida state director for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposes the bear hunt.

""Just because bears are sighted doesn't mean anything. We as humans, our population, is growing and we are encroaching on bear habitat,"" MacFall said. ""As we encroach on their habitat and remove some of their natural food sources, and build new developments and put out trash, which is like a buffet, we'll see more of them.""

The fish and wildlife commission will take up the controversial issue June 22 and 23 when it meets in Eastpoint. It will consider the options, which biologists based on bear population data, information gathered during last's year's hunt, and input from the public including animal welfare advocates, environmental groups, hunters and gun rights organizations during the past year and a half. That input included public comments during a recent series of webinars held by agency officials.

The commission can accept, reject or modify these options presented:

¦ Biologists recommend allowing the bear hunt but with more restrictions on hunters. New restrictions would include reducing the area open to hunting to correspond with areas of the state where human-bear conflicts are more prevalent, forbidding bears to be hunted when another bear including cubs is present, limiting the number of hunting permits and increasing enforcement measures requiring hunters to tag their bears immediately.

¦ Allow the bear hunt with identical provisions to last year's but with updated objectives.

¦ Ban bear hunting in Florida in the future.

Last year, Florida held its first state-sanctioned bear hunt in 21 years. Hunters reported killing 304 bears statewide including 27 in Northeast Florida during the hunt scheduled for seven days but ended early when it neared the 320-bear quota set by the state.

Meanwhile, it's the time of year when black bears are roaming statewide. In late spring and early summer, young bears disperse to find and establish their own home ranges. They've been seen in several Florida cities over the past few weeks, state biologists say.

Recent bear population updates south and west of Jacksonville have shown an increase over the past 12 years, said Karen Parker, a fish and wildlife commission spokeswoman. ""Bear activity has been fairly steady, both statewide and in Northeast Florida,"" she said.

In Northeast Florida, there have been 44 calls reporting bear activity from Jan. 1 through Monday this year. Last year, there were 59 calls in the region during the same period, Parker said.

Parker said statewide this year, there have been 1,774 calls from Jan. 1 through Monday. In comparison, there were 1,575 calls statewide last year during the same period, she said.

""We have seen bear range increase from 18 percent of their historic range in 1993 to 45 percent of their historic range today,"" said Parker, noting bears have been found just about everywhere in Florida over the years, including metropolitan areas.

Commission staff during recent bear management webinars have said another hunt is among the options available to manage Florida's growing bear population - estimated at about 4,350 statewide, including about 620 in Northeast Florida - and reduce the number of potentially dangerous human-bear interactions.

Noting its primary focus is public safety, the agency will continue working to educate the public about how to reduce bear-human conflicts. That includes ensuring food and garbage aren't left outdoors in areas where bears are frequently seen, and also using bear resistant trash cans, said Susan Smith, director of community relations for the commission.

However, some organizations are urging the fish and wildlife commission to approve a bear hunt this fall.

The National Rifle Association and Unified Sportsmen of Florida also want the commission to increase the number of days for the hunt, which those groups assert is necessary to protect public safety.

""Bears continue to terrorize homeowners and prevent families from allowing children to play outside in some areas,"" wrote Marion Hammer, an influential Tallahassee lobbyist representing the two gun-rights organizations, in a May 31 letter to the commission. Those organizations say the bear population is far larger than current statistics indicate and pose an increasing risk to people.

""And while FWC is working to educate people about securing trash and is trying to move dangerous bears out of residential areas, those programs are helpful but cannot succeed without hunts to reduce the population,"" wrote Hammer, a past president of the NRA and current executive director of Unified Sportsmen of Florida.

However, three respected biologists experienced in wildlife population studies are urging the fish and wildlife commission to hold off on another hunt until after more bear population studies are done. Bear sanctuaries also should be established, according to Matthew Aresco, director of Nokuse Plantation in Bruce, Joseph Gutherie, a conservation biologist with expertise in bears, and Joseph Travis, a Florida State University biology professor, in their June 4 letter to the commission.

They propose bear sanctuaries be designated on federal lands in Florida such as the Apalachicola, Ocala and Osecola national forests encompassing a total 1.25 million acres, Big Cypress National Preserve spanning 729,000 acres and U.S. Department of Defense lands.

""Bear hunting could occur outside of the sanctuaries where appropriate with hunting objectives set through biological sustainability analyses,"" the three wrote in the letter.

Although none in Northeast Florida, county commissions in five counties - Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Pinellas, Seminole and Volusia - have passed nonbinding resolutions opposing another black bear hunt in Florida. The Hillsborough County Commission voting unanimously June 2 also sent a letter voicing its objections to the fish and wildlife commission.

The Hillsborough resolution states Florida's bear population generally is confined to fragmented ecosystems, and as recently was 2012 was a state-designated threatened species. A bear hunt, the resolution said, is not warranted.

""The Florida black bear hunt seems to place the needs of particular interest groups above those of a vulnerable species that does not currently constitute a sustainable hunting resource,"" said the commission in its resolution.

""That the Hillsborough County Board of County Commissioners opposes an open hunting season on Florida black bear at this time given the current population count, current fragmented habitat conditions, concerns regarding conservation efforts, and concerns regarding the methodology, and supporting data, used to justify the hunt,"" according to the resolution.

About a dozen cities statewide have passed similar resolutions but none in Northeast Florida as of Tuesday.

Meanwhile, bear hunt opponents plan a series of public rallies in several cities statewide leading up to commission meeting. Organized by OneProtest, an advocacy organization, a rally is scheduled for 11 a.m.-1 p.m. Saturday at 25-61 Cathedral Place, St. Augustine.",Florida black bears are on the move - meandering through Northeast Florida neighborhoods recently including a scared and agitated 350-pound bruin relocated safely by state wildlife biologists after i…

The unlimited bus service is a two-year pilot program and a partnership between MCC and the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority. MCC’s Board of Trustees approved the program May 19; the KCATA Board of Commissioners approved it on May 25.

The U-Pass, as it is known, will provide full-time and part-time MCC students, who are enrolled in courses for credit, with free, unlimited access to all RideKC transit, including bus service operated by KCATA, Johnson County Transit and Independence. The U-Pass is not available to non-credit program students.

MCC has about 18,000 students a semester attending five campuses, including Blue River in Independence and Longview in Lee’s Summit.

Shannon Johnson, an MCC-Penn Valley student, says U-Pass sounds good to her “because I spend between $25 and $50 a month buying a bus pass, and it gets a little hard because my mom pays for it. This would be a lot easier on the family.”

Johnson, who’s working on an associate degree in criminal justice, says there were days last fall when “if I didn’t have a bus pass I couldn’t get to class.”

MCC leaders view the transit program as one more way to support student success.

“We have many motivated students for whom transportation becomes a barrier to completing their studies at MCC,” said Kathrine Swanson, vice chancellor for student success and engagement. There are prospective students, too, who can’t attend college because of transportation challenges.

“MCC continues to seek ways to provide our students with the resources needed to get the most out of their educational experience,” Swanson said. “Sometimes the needed resources are beyond the traditional academic supports.”

Shelley Temple Kneuvean, vice chancellor for financial and administrative services, says the program is a win-win for both the college and the KCATA. It will ultimately “benefit the thousands of MCC students as they become riders of KCATA's transportation system,” she said. “There is a strategic alignment between MCC's mission to ensure higher education is within the reach of all people and KCATA's mission to provide high-quality public transportation throughout the region.”

All five MCC campuses are served by at least one RideKC route, with connections to routes all over the region.

RideKC offers more than 90 routes throughout the Kansas City region. Metropolitan Community College is working with KCATA to more closely align bus schedules with campus class schedules.

A William Southern Elementary School teacher is among eight students who graduated from William Jewell College’s Master of Science in Education program. William Jewell hosted a master’s hooding ceremony on May 14.

Kendra Terranella of Independence, a teacher at William Southern in the Independence School District, earned the master’s degree along with five other metro area instructors.

William Jewell’s Department of Education received approval from the Higher Learning Commission in 2013 to begin offering the college’s first graduate program, a master of science in education focused on differentiated instruction. Differentiated instruction requires teachers to consider the needs of every student and use purposefully selected, research-based, instructional strategies to advance each student’s learning. The program is on the list of Schools Approved for Degree or Certification Earning Programs by the Cooperating School Districts of Kansas City.

Several students from Eastern Jackson County earned their degrees from Emporia State University in Emporia, Kansas, following the spring 2016 semester.

Like now.

A federal judge has declared the Texas foster care system unconstitutionally flawed and ordered an independent overhaul. Unlike most other states under similar orders, Texas is fighting the ruling.

Alongside that, the Department of Family and Protective Services is lowering its qualifications to be a frontline caseworker in determining a child's safety and making critical decisions on their well-being.

""That the state is under a court order to reform the foster care system, that says it all, don't you think,"" said Miriam Nisenbaum, executive director of the Texas chapter of the National Association of Social Workers.

Nisenbaum and Amber White, Panhandle branch chair of the NASW, are critics of a recommendation that would lower requirements for CPS caseworkers, which they say will put less-qualified workers in the field and put more children at risk.

""CPS is going backward, not forward,"" Nisenbaum said. ""When workers are less qualified and skilled, it's the children who pay the price.""

The Department of Family and Protective Services is recommending lowering the requirement for a beginning caseworker from a four-year college degree to a two-year associates degree.

The degree has never had to be in social work or a similar field. An agriculture, economics or mass communication degree has been good enough. If the Texas legislature votes for the change next year, it will be less than that.

""In a perfect world, all CPS workers would be trained social workers,"" said White, formerly a pediatric social worker at Northwest Texas Hospital. ""But now you could have someone with just a two-year degree or equivalent work experience making decisions on abused and neglected children, child development, the family dynamic and all with basically on-the-job training.

""Now someone with little education in that area is expected to comprehend the complexity of those issues and make life-changing decisions.""

Why the state is advocating relaxing its standards is easy to see. CPS caseworkers are overburdened, overwhelmed and underpaid. They are often stepping into a minefield of dysfunctional families with at-risk children - with as many as 15 to 25 cases - for an annual salary of $32,000.

It is thankless and tough, but vital job, and few want the stress.

Not surprisingly, turnover rate is very high and the applicant pool is very low. Almost as if to throw up their hands, the state is lowering the bar to cast a wider net for workers. Maybe they figure more caseworkers, even if inexperienced and green, is better than no caseworkers at all.

""Many individuals out there without college degrees have direct, varied and practical experience working with children, young adults and people with disabilities - and the passion to do it,"" said Patrick Crimmins, DFPS media relations manager.

""Combining that experience, passion and the caseworker training program will be a winning combination.""

Sounds kind of flowery. Will it fail to address the high turnover rate while leading to underqualified workers, as Nisenbaum fears, or will it be a panacea for a broken and overwhelmed system?

""Our agency is tasked with child protections,"" said Paul Zimmerman, DFPS spokesman. ""We have to fill the mission. We have to try something new, and we're trying something new. Time will tell on the impact.""

Texas could have the dubious distinction of being the only state out of 50 that doesn't require a four-year degree for caseworkers. Florida went a different route. Like Texas, Florida had a high child mortality rate.

Its legislature, however, mandated by 2017 that 50 percent of all CPS workers not just have degrees, but social work degrees.

Nisenbaum, a former CPS caseworker, would like to see some or all of the 23 universities in the state with social work degrees implement curriculums specific to CPS work and offer bachelor's and master's degree programs. Raise salaries as well - the state, she says, has the money.

It appears in its current structure, the entire foster care system and family protective services is like trying to push a boulder uphill.

""It's not about filling vacancies,"" Nisenbaum said. ""It's about taking some training and in a few weeks running out in the field with your hair on fire.

""What they are going to encounter on the ground is pretty stressful and will take a good amount of education and skill, and being more than just passionate. What is being advocated will hurt children.""

The former TOWIE star, who recently admitted ""never say never"" to returning to the show, revealed he would be meeting the US presidential election candidate.

Speaking exclusively to OK! Online, Joey revealed what was coming up ahead of his brand new series of Educating Joey Essex.

As well as heading to America during the election period, Joey will also be celebrity hunting in Los Angeles and will even head to Florida to get up close to some crocodiles.

On his big meeting with presidential candidate Donald Trump, Joey admitted he didn't know too much about him.

Joey told us: ""The last one is the presidential election in America, meeting Donald Trump. I'll ask him: 'What is the score mate?' I don't really know much about him only that he's a business entrepreneur and that he's trying to become president.""

Joey also discussed the other shows he has lined up in his new series, including that celebrity spotting trip to LA.

He said: ""We're going to LA at the end of this month, doing a sort of celebrity one where we meet all the celebrities. Well I'm not sure we'll meet them all but we'll be bump into some.

""I was in LA walking down the street, it's ridiculous, you just see Floyd Mayweather walking down the street. It's mad to see them people just walking down street.""

He continued: ""So yeah we're doing that one, learning about fitness and going to some important places. The second ones about Florida, we're going to see some crocodiles. Don't know if I'll be too close to the crocodiles, they'll probably make me won't they.""

With Joey's show Reem Queen at 90 set to air on Sunday, as he celebrates the Queen's milestone birthday, he revealed where he wanted to take his series next.

He told us: ""I'd love to do something with gadgets. I'd love to go to China, I think it would be something I'd really find interesting. I think it'd make a good show but that's not on the cards.""",Former TOWIE star reveals details of new series including celebrity spotting and crocodile hunting

On Wednesday, one had a queasy stomach and another complained of a sore eye.

""We never know what's going to come in the door,"" said Taylor, the Westchase school's full-time registered nurse.

Those visitors were on top of the more than 25 daily medicines and procedures — from pills and insulin monitoring to catheters and tube feedings — that Taylor and her health assistant, Diane Schonauer, must give to students, not to mention the paperwork to document it all. Lowry, a neighborhood school brimming with about 950 kids, has an unusually high number of students with special needs, and that warranted a full-time registered nurse and full-time health assistant to staff the clinic.

Most schools aren't so prepared, a fact recently brought to light by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has issued a new recommendation that every school have one full-time registered nurse. The group says in the June issue of Pediatrics that it can no longer support its previous ratio of one nurse for every 750 students because of the ""increasingly complex health needs"" of today's children.

Staffing levels vary widely in school clinics across the Tampa Bay area.

Hillsborough and Pasco counties have at least one trained staffer manning each school's clinic every day, with nurses splitting their time between two or three schools.

But at many schools in Pinellas County, no one staffs the clinic for a few days a week as nurses rotate among schools, and front office staffers are left to handle sick students. About 14 percent of the time, Pinellas students who go to the health room don't return to class, according to the Florida Department of Health. That's the highest rate among all four area school districts in a category that researchers say is major drag on student performance, including graduation rates.

Hernando County, meanwhile, has the highest nurse-to-student ratio in the region: one for every 2,728 students, according to state health department figures for 2014, the latest year available.

In its push for better staffing, the pediatrics academy says survival rates for infants born at 26 and 27 weeks of gestation have jumped to 80 and 90 percent, respectively, leading to an increase in the number of children entering school with moderate-to-severe disabilities and learning or behavior problems. Chronic illnesses such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes and food allergies also are on the rise. And one out of every three children is overweight or obese.

Before becoming a school nurse, Taylor spent years as a delivery room and neonatal intensive care nurse at several hospitals, including St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa. Years ago, she witnessed babies survive births at 27 weeks and now gravitates toward working with small children with special needs.

""I'm seeing both ends of the spectrum now being here,"" she said.

For many students, the school nurse is their only access to health care.

In Pasco County, the spacious clinic at Woodland Elementary is detached from the front office and housed with student services. The full-time clinic assistant there, Cyndi Kirkpatrick, keeps bins of fresh clothing and shoes for children who stain or rip their school outfits. About 83 percent of students at the Zephyrhills school are on free and reduced lunch program.

The school projects its enrollment to grow to over 1,000 in the coming school year, which will make it the second-largest elementary in Pasco County. Principal Shauntte Butcher, who came to Woodland in February, secured funding for a second part-time staffer in the clinic.

That's because front office staff were being pulled away to help Kirkpatrick on days when registered nurse Debbie Dee was away tending to students at Pasco Elementary and St. Anthony's Catholic School, which contracts with the district for nursing services.

""I can't serve all of my students and parents if I'm continually having my front office staff being short and provide services in the clinic,"" Butcher said. ""When you hit that threshold of 1,000 you need to make sure you have staff in place to address that.""

That's why Sandy Hopp looks forward to coming into work on Tuesdays and Thursdays as the receptionist at Shore Acres Elementary in St. Petersburg. Those are the days when nurse Gina Norris is in and Hopp can focus on her desk duties.

Stephanie Cox, a Shore Acres parent and co-founder of Pinellas Parents for Healthy Schools — the same parent group advocating for district-wide recess — said she hadn't realized the school had a nurse until recently.

""I couldn't even picture her,"" Cox said of the nurse. ""She didn't have a relationship with anyone at the school because she was seldom there.""

Cox and her group are now fighting to bring awareness to the importance of having a nurse at every school.

""The district can do better,"" she said. ""And the fact that other districts have nurses in their schools every day shows me that our district can have that if we provide the funding.""

Funding for school health services in Florida districts comes from a patchwork of county health department and school district dollars and sometimes money from community partners. Palm Beach County has a special health care taxing district that generates enough revenue to spend $90.26 on health services per student — far above any school system in Tampa Bay, and enough to give almost every school its own nurse.

The Pinellas school district recently requested funding from the county commission to staff full-time licensed practical nurses in seven elementary schools with F grades.

School nurse supervisors for the Pinellas, Pasco and Hillsborough districts agree that direct funding from the state could help the shortage. School nurses today are paid around $20 an hour — a salary that doesn't compete with the private sector.

""If the state would recognize the fact that school nurses can make a difference and that we need more of them. … I would welcome that with open arms,"" said Pasco County school health services supervisor Lisa Kern, who also sits on the board of directors for the National Association of School Nurses.

On Wednesday, one had a queasy stomach and another complained of a sore eye.

""We never know what's going to come in the door,"" said Taylor, the Westchase school's full-time registered nurse.

Those visitors were on top of the more than 25 daily medicines and procedures — from pills and insulin monitoring to catheters and tube feedings — that Taylor and her health assistant, Diane Schonauer, must give to students, not to mention the paperwork to document it all. Lowry, a neighborhood school brimming with about 950 kids, has an unusually high number of students with special needs, and that warranted a full-time registered nurse and full-time health assistant to staff the clinic.

Most schools aren't so prepared, a fact recently brought to light by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has issued a new recommendation that every school have one full-time registered nurse. The group says in the June issue of Pediatrics that it can no longer support its previous ratio of one nurse for every 750 students because of the ""increasingly complex health needs"" of today's children.

Staffing levels vary widely in school clinics across the Tampa Bay area.

Hillsborough and Pasco counties have at least one trained staffer manning each school's clinic every day, with nurses splitting their time between two or three schools.

But at many schools in Pinellas County, no one staffs the clinic for a few days a week as nurses rotate among schools, and front office staffers are left to handle sick students. About 14 percent of the time, Pinellas students who go to the health room don't return to class, according to the Florida Department of Health. That's the highest rate among all four area school districts in a category that researchers say is major drag on student performance, including graduation rates.

Hernando County, meanwhile, has the highest nurse-to-student ratio in the region: one for every 2,728 students, according to state health department figures for 2014, the latest year available.

In its push for better staffing, the pediatrics academy says survival rates for infants born at 26 and 27 weeks of gestation have jumped to 80 and 90 percent, respectively, leading to an increase in the number of children entering school with moderate-to-severe disabilities and learning or behavior problems. Chronic illnesses such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes and food allergies also are on the rise. And one out of every three children is overweight or obese.

Before becoming a school nurse, Taylor spent years as a delivery room and neonatal intensive care nurse at several hospitals, including St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa. Years ago, she witnessed babies survive births at 27 weeks and now gravitates toward working with small children with special needs.

""I'm seeing both ends of the spectrum now being here,"" she said.

For many students, the school nurse is their only access to health care.

In Pasco County, the spacious clinic at Woodland Elementary is detached from the front office and housed with student services. The full-time clinic assistant there, Cyndi Kirkpatrick, keeps bins of fresh clothing and shoes for children who stain or rip their school outfits. About 83 percent of students at the Zephyrhills school are on free and reduced lunch program.

The school projects its enrollment to grow to over 1,000 in the coming school year, which will make it the second-largest elementary in Pasco County. Principal Shauntte Butcher, who came to Woodland in February, secured funding for a second part-time staffer in the clinic.

That's because front office staff were being pulled away to help Kirkpatrick on days when registered nurse Debbie Dee was away tending to students at Pasco Elementary and St. Anthony's Catholic School, which contracts with the district for nursing services.

""I can't serve all of my students and parents if I'm continually having my front office staff being short and provide services in the clinic,"" Butcher said. ""When you hit that threshold of 1,000 you need to make sure you have staff in place to address that.""

That's why Sandy Hopp looks forward to coming into work on Tuesdays and Thursdays as the receptionist at Shore Acres Elementary in St. Petersburg. Those are the days when nurse Gina Norris is in and Hopp can focus on her desk duties.

Stephanie Cox, a Shore Acres parent and co-founder of Pinellas Parents for Healthy Schools — the same parent group advocating for district-wide recess — said she hadn't realized the school had a nurse until recently.

""I couldn't even picture her,"" Cox said of the nurse. ""She didn't have a relationship with anyone at the school because she was seldom there.""

Cox and her group are now fighting to bring awareness to the importance of having a nurse at every school.

However, Creative decided to halt his push, and he was released in January of 2010. Here are some highlights of the interview:

""[Zack Ryder] got over by himself. They [were] giving him a little bit, and then he went out there and got over huge. What happened? Why doesn't he get the ball? Or, at least, they give him the ball and they take it away right away. I don't think it's fair. You have an amazing worker like Dolph Ziggler. What's wrong? Why isn't he a main event guy right now? Even another guy like Heath Slater. I've always been a big fan of his work. I remember when he first got hired in Deep South [Wrestling], and I worked with him a ton back in FCW. Why aren't you pushing these guys and you're trying to push the same guys over and over again? If it doesn't work with this guy, try another guy.""

Sheamus being difficult to work with:

""He always wanted to be the dominant big guy. If I stand next to you, we're basically the same size, so there's no big guy/little guy situation going on here. When he got in the mindset that he was big guy and I was little guy, he got a little bit more hesitant about a few things in the match. Before I started working a program with him, I had a couple of guys approach me [and said] that he was getting a little bit too stiff with them. As a joke, Fandango started calling me Uncle Perez, because he said that I was like the Bull Durham of developmental because I was there so long. Some of the guys would approach me and say, hey, I need your help. I'm like, what's going on? They'd say, can you talk to the office? I'd say, for what? You can talk to the office. You can talk to Dusty [Rhodes] or Tom [Prichard], I don't care. [They'd say], I'm working Sheamus, and he's a bit stiff. He keeps hitting me a little too hard. I'm like, you know, tell him to ease up! Pop him back! He'll understand what's going on! [They'd say], well, I'm fairly new here, and I just don't wanna ruffle any feathers. I'm like, so you want me to ruffle the feathers for you? Is that what it is?

""When I got into the program with Sheamus, I do remember one time we were working, and he popped me a couple of times. I always give the guys a 'three strike rule.' So he pops me one, and I go, okay – one. He pops me twice – two. He pops he three times – okay, my turn. So, after I popped him back, I left my hands stamped on his back for like a week. I think after that, we had no more problems. He wasn't stiff or anything.""

""To be honest, I don't understand if I did anything wrong when I got released. John Laurinaitis, he didn't say exactly why, they just said the only thing they had for me was to job me out. I'm like, why? From getting called up to beating Matt Hardy to be on the PPV, and having the biggest heel (Vickie Guerrero) by my side, I was on cloud 9. Wow, this is amazing. But, to be completely honest, when I got hired after a bit, there was someone very close to the head honchos, or someone up there did not like me. I came to that conclusion after one of the creative would call me and say, ""Hey. We have you penciled in for this."" A few weeks later, boom. Nothing. ""Oh, we have you penciled in for that.""

With the International Submarine Band, the Byrds, and the Flying Burrito Brothers, the songwriter pioneered the concept of a rock band playing country music, and as a solo artist he moved even further into the country realm, blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.

While he was alive, Parsons was a cult figure that never sold many records but influenced countless fellow musicians, from the Rolling Stones to the Byrds. In the years since his death, his stature has only grown, as numerous rock and country artists build on his small, but enormously influential, body of work.

Gram Parsons was born Cecil Ingram Connor on November 5, 1946. He was the grandson of John Snivley, who owned roughly one-third of all the citrus fields in Florida, and the son of Coon Dog Connor, an Air Force veteran who owned a box-making factory in Waycross, Georgia.

As a child, Parsons learned how to play the piano at the age of nine, the same year he saw Elvis Presley perform at his school; following the seminal performance, Parsons decided to become a musician. When he was 12, Parsons' father committed suicide, and the family moved in with Parsons' grandparents in Winter Haven, FL. A year after the move, his mother married Robert Parsons; Gram was then adopted by his stepfather, and the child legally changed his name to Gram Parsons.

At the age of 14, Parsons began playing in the local rock & roll band the Pacers, which evolved into the Legends. During its time together, the Legends featured Jim Stafford and Kent Lavoie, who would later come to fame under the name Lobo. In 1963, Parsons formed a folk group called the Shilos who performed throughout Florida and cut several demos. He graduated from high school two years later; on the same day he graduated, however, his mother died of alcohol poisoning.

Following his graduation, Gram Parsons enrolled at Harvard to study theology. He only spent one semester at Harvard, during which time he devoted more energy to playing music than attending classes. Meanwhile, he also formed the International Submarine Band with guitarist John Nuese, bassist Ian Dunlop and drummer Mickey Gauvin.

After he dropped out of college, Parsons moved to New York City with the International Submarine Band in 1966. The group spent a year in New York, developing a heavily country-influenced rock & roll sound and cutting two unsuccessful singles for Columbia Records. The band then relocated to Los Angeles in 1967, where they secured a record contract with Lee Hazlewood's LHI record label. Their debut album, Safe at Home, was released in early 1968, but by the time it appeared in stores, the International Submarine Band had already disbanded.

Around the time the International Submarine Band dissolved, Parsons met Chris Hillman, the bassist for the Byrds. At that time, the Byrds were rebuilding their lineup and Hillman recommended to the band's leader, Roger McGuinn, that Parsons join the ranks. By the spring of 1968, Parsons had become a member of the Byrds and was largely responsible for the group's shift towards country music with the album Sweetheart of the Rodeo. The album was originally planned to feature Parsons' lead vocals, but as he was still contractually obligated to LHI, his voice had to be stripped from the final product.

The Gilded Palace of SinGram Parsons only spent a few months with the Byrds, leaving the band in the fall of 1968 because he refused to accompany them on a tour of South Africa, allegedly because he opposed apartheid. Chris Hillman left the band shortly after him, and the duo formed the Flying Burrito Brothers in late 1968. Parsons and Hillman enlisted pedal steel guitarist ""Sneaky"" Pete Kleinow and bassist Chris Ethridge to complete the band's lineup, and the group and recorded a debut album with a series of session drummers.

The Gilded Palace of Sin, the Flying Burrito Brothers' debut album, was released in 1969. Although the album only sold a few thousand copies, the group gathered a dedicated cult following that was mainly composed of musicians, including the Rolling Stones. In fact, by the time the album was released, Parsons had begun hanging around the Rolling Stones frequently, becoming close friends with Keith Richards. Parsons had experimented with drugs and alcohol before he met Richards, but in 1969 he dove deep into substance abuse, which he supported with his sizable trust fund.

Parsons recorded a second album with the Flying Burrito Brothers, but by the time the record -- titled Burrito Deluxe -- appeared in the spring of 1970, he had already left the band. Shortly after his departure, he recorded a handful of songs with producer Terry Melcher but failed to complete the album. Following those sessions, Parsons entered a holding pattern in which he acted the role of a rock star instead of actually playing music.

He spent much of his time either hanging out with the Stones or ingesting large amounts of drugs and alcohol; frequently, he did a combination of the two. In 1971, Parsons toured with the Rolling Stones in England and attended the recording of the band's Exile on Main Street, and it appeared that he would sign with the band's record label. Instead, he headed back to Los Angeles late in 1971, spending the rest of the year and the first half of 1972 writing material for an impending solo album. He met Emmylou Harris through Chris Hillman, and Parsons asked her to join his backing band; she accepted.

By the summer of 1972, he was prepared to enter the studio to record his first solo album. Parsons had assembled a band -- which included Harris, guitarist James Burton, bassist Rick Grech, Barry Tashian, Glen D. Hardin, and Ronnie Tutt -- and had asked Merle Haggard to produce the album. After meeting Parsons, however, Haggard turned the offer down, and Parsons chose Haggard's engineer, Hugh Davis, as the album's producer instead. The resulting album, G.P., was released late in 1972 to good reviews but poor sales.

Following the release of G.P., Parsons embarked on a small tour with his backing band, the Fallen Angels. After the tour was completed, they entered the studio to record his second album, Grievous Angel. The album was finished toward the end of the summer, and Parsons celebrated its completion by taking a vacation near the Joshua Tree National Monument in California. He spent most of his time there consuming drugs and alcohol.

On September 19, 1973, he overdosed on morphine and tequila; although rushed to the Yucca Valley Hospital, he was pronounced dead on arrival. According to the funeral plans, his body was to be flown back to New Orleans for a burial. However, Parsons' road manager stole the body after the funeral and carried it back out to the Joshua Tree desert, where he cremated the body using gasoline. Phil Kaufman later revealed that the cremation had been Parsons' wish, and although he could not be convicted for stealing the body, he was arrested for stealing and burning the coffin.

In the two decades following Gram Parsons' death, his legacy continued to grow, as both country and rock musicians built on the music he left behind. Musicians such as Emmylou Harris and Elvis Costello covered his songs, and his influence could still be heard well into the next millennium.","Muddy Bottom BluesProgram #67 (June 10 at 8:00PM)Gram Parsons is the father of country-rock.

Gram Parsons was born Cecil Ingram Connor on November 5, 1946. He was the grandson of John Snivley, who owned roughly one-third of all the citrus fields in Florida, and the son of Coon Dog Connor, an Air Force veteran who owned a box-making factory in Waycross, Georgia.

As a child, Parsons learned how to play the piano at the age of nine, the same year he saw Elvis Presley perform at his school; following the seminal performance, Parsons decided to become a musician. When he was 12, Parsons' father committed suicide, and the family moved in with Parsons' grandparents in Winter Haven, FL. A year after the move, his mother married Robert Parsons; Gram was then adopted by his stepfather, and the child legally changed his name to Gram Parsons.

At the age of 14, Parsons began playing in the local rock & roll band the Pacers, which evolved into the Legends. During its time together, the Legends featured Jim Stafford and Kent Lavoie, who would later come to fame under the name Lobo. In 1963, Parsons formed a folk group called the Shilos who performed throughout Florida and cut several demos. He graduated from high school two years later; on the same day he graduated, however, his mother died of alcohol poisoning.

Following his graduation, Gram Parsons enrolled at Harvard to study theology. He only spent one semester at Harvard, during which time he devoted more energy to playing music than attending classes. Meanwhile, he also formed the International Submarine Band with guitarist John Nuese, bassist Ian Dunlop and drummer Mickey Gauvin.

After he dropped out of college, Parsons moved to New York City with the International Submarine Band in 1966. The group spent a year in New York, developing a heavily country-influenced rock & roll sound and cutting two unsuccessful singles for Columbia Records. The band then relocated to Los Angeles in 1967, where they secured a record contract with Lee Hazlewood's LHI record label. Their debut album, Safe at Home, was released in early 1968, but by the time it appeared in stores, the International Submarine Band had already disbanded.

Around the time the International Submarine Band dissolved, Parsons met Chris Hillman, the bassist for the Byrds. At that time, the Byrds were rebuilding their lineup and Hillman recommended to the band's leader, Roger McGuinn, that Parsons join the ranks. By the spring of 1968, Parsons had become a member of the Byrds and was largely responsible for the group's shift towards country music with the album Sweetheart of the Rodeo. The album was originally planned to feature Parsons' lead vocals, but as he was still contractually obligated to LHI, his voice had to be stripped from the final product.

The Gilded Palace of SinGram Parsons only spent a few months with the Byrds, leaving the band in the fall of 1968 because he refused to accompany them on a tour of South Africa, allegedly because he opposed apartheid. Chris Hillman left the band shortly after him, and the duo formed the Flying Burrito Brothers in late 1968. Parsons and Hillman enlisted pedal steel guitarist ""Sneaky"" Pete Kleinow and bassist Chris Ethridge to complete the band's lineup, and the group and recorded a debut album with a series of session drummers.

The Gilded Palace of Sin, the Flying Burrito Brothers' debut album, was released in 1969. Although the album only sold a few thousand copies, the group gathered a dedicated cult following that was mainly composed of musicians, including the Rolling Stones. In fact, by the time the album was released, Parsons had begun hanging around the Rolling Stones frequently, becoming close friends with Keith Richards. Parsons had experimented with drugs and alcohol before he met Richards, but in 1969 he dove deep into substance abuse, which he supported with his sizable trust fund.

Parsons recorded a second album with the Flying Burrito Brothers, but by the time the record -- titled Burrito Deluxe -- appeared in the spring of 1970, he had already left the band. Shortly after his departure, he recorded a handful of songs with producer Terry Melcher but failed to complete the album. Following those sessions, Parsons entered a holding pattern in which he acted the role of a rock star instead of actually playing music.

He spent much of his time either hanging out with the Stones or ingesting large amounts of drugs and alcohol; frequently, he did a combination of the two. In 1971, Parsons toured with the Rolling Stones in England and attended the recording of the band's Exile on Main Street, and it appeared that he would sign with the band's record label. Instead, he headed back to Los Angeles late in 1971, spending the rest of the year and the first half of 1972 writing material for an impending solo album. He met Emmylou Harris through Chris Hillman, and Parsons asked her to join his backing band; she accepted.

By the summer of 1972, he was prepared to enter the studio to record his first solo album. Parsons had assembled a band -- which included Harris, guitarist James Burton, bassist Rick Grech, Barry Tashian, Glen D. Hardin, and Ronnie Tutt -- and had asked Merle Haggard to produce the album. After meeting Parsons, however, Haggard turned the offer down, and Parsons chose Haggard's engineer, Hugh Davis, as the album's producer instead. The resulting album, G.P., was released late in 1972 to good reviews but poor sales.

Following the release of G.P., Parsons embarked on a small tour with his backing band, the Fallen Angels. After the tour was completed, they entered the studio to record his second album, Grievous Angel. The album was finished toward the end of the summer, and Parsons celebrated its completion by taking a vacation near the Joshua Tree National Monument in California. He spent most of his time there consuming drugs and alcohol.

On September 19, 1973, he overdosed on morphine and tequila; although rushed to the Yucca Valley Hospital, he was pronounced dead on arrival. According to the funeral plans, his body was to be flown back to New Orleans for a burial. However, Parsons' road manager stole the body after the funeral and carried it back out to the Joshua Tree desert, where he cremated the body using gasoline. Phil Kaufman later revealed that the cremation had been Parsons' wish, and although he could not be convicted for stealing the body, he was arrested for stealing and burning the coffin.

In the two decades following Gram Parsons' death, his legacy continued to grow, as both country and rock musicians built on the music he left behind. Musicians such as Emmylou Harris and Elvis Costello covered his songs, and his influence could still be heard well into the next millennium.","Muddy Bottom BluesProgram #67 (June 10 at 8:00PM)Gram Parsons is the father of country-rock.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recently announced a rule to better protect consumers from unscrupulous small-dollar loan practices. Like my colleagues in Congress, I welcome new protections that will ensure consumers do not fall into debt traps. However, if the CFPB imposes regulations without carefully balancing the needs of consumers, it will fail to provide financial protection to those who need it most. I fear that in trying to protect consumers, the CFPB’s rule will cut off access to short-term credit without providing another avenue for those who need these types of loans. This, in turn, could force consumers to turn to more expensive alternatives, or worse, unregulated or otherwise illicit venues for securing loans. This concern was rightly noted by Drew Breakspear, commissioner of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. In his letter to CFPB Director Richard Cordray on June 1, 2015, Mr. Breakspear wrote that the CFPB’s proposal will “probably eliminate access to small loans and credit, and will force consumers to turn to more expensive and potentially unlicensed financial service providers, subjecting them to greater risks of financial fraud.” The State of Florida knows all too well that there can be dishonest actors in the payday industry. That is why, 16 years ago, the Florida legislature acted unanimously to reform the state’s payday loan system to protect consumers from falling into debt traps. In the years since, Florida consumers have been able to get short-term, low-dollar loans to help them pay a bill before the electricity gets cut off, or help them cover a car payment, pay the rent, or purchase a sick child’s prescription medication.

To confirm this, one simply needs to look at the CFPB’s own data on the number of complaints that have been received against the industry.

Six mayors and $33 million later, the plan finally came to fruition.

Mayor Bob Buckhorn officially opened the final segment of the 2.6-mile Riverwalk on Saturday morning, welcoming the public to the final piece of a complex that runs from Channelside to Water Works Park.

About 200 people attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony on Saturday for the Cass Street Cycle Track.

Children scooted along on skateboards under the Laurel Street Bridge and the scent of fish from the river was overpowered by the smell of empanadas from a local food truck.

The track, which city officials say is the first of its kind in Florida, has two paths and protects cyclists and pedestrians from road traffic.

""This river will be the center of everything that we do,"" Buckhorn said. ""We're not done yet.""

Buckhorn thanked City Council members for their support of the project. He pointed across the river to a 23-acre plot of land and said the park there will undergo a dramatic makeover soon. Last month, city officials approved a $33.5 million plan to overhaul Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park. It will include a number of amenities, like a community room, a large shaded deck, a public dock, playgrounds and even a stop for a water taxi.

The project is expected to take 18 months to complete and should be open in the fall of 2017.

First conceived by Mayor Bill Poe in 1975, the Riverwalk became one of the most important pieces of Buckhorn's time in office.

A Democrat, he seemed elated at the turnout for the ribbon cutting and smiled as he took a subtle jab at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who held a rally Saturday not far from the cycle track.

""I'd rather build a Riverwalk than talk about building a wall,"" Buckhorn said.

Josh Young rides the trail to work every day at the Straz Center for the Performing Arts and his family, including daughters Penny and Genevieve, use it each weekend. For families like the Youngs, the cycle track is a welcome addition, a safe place to ride and exercise.

Cyclists clapped and whistled as Buckhorn grabbed a pair of golden scissors to cut a golden silk ribbon. He invited the attendees to gather around him for a picture as he attempted to tear the silk with the dull scissors.

Genevieve Young, 11, tried to get in the picture but shyly backed away.

""Come here,"" Buckhorn said, inviting her to the group photo.

Genevieve swooped over the ribbon but looked back for her 9-year-old sister, Penny Young.

""Is that your sister?"" he asked.

""Go bring her too,"" Buckhorn said.

And the sisters were together as the ribbon was sliced.","TAMPA — Forty years ago, the idea of building a park along the Hillsborough River first took root among Tampa politicians. Six mayors and $33 million later, the plan finally came to fruition."

We frenziedly dash from task to task and event to event, proudly proclaiming to every sympathetic ear just how frantically busy we are. Commuters going between increasingly busy work and personal lives. The article was clearly negative. But recent research indicates all this busyness may not be such a bad thing after all. Not in the workplace, anyway. The culmination of five studies, published a few months ago by the Universities of Columbia, Miami, Pittsburgh and Florida, found being busy can actually make you more motivated and productive.

Children busy at school and with ever-increasing homework. The first study of 201 participants showed busyness made people feel as though they were using their time more effectively. Of course, they may not have been using their time effectively at all but their perception was that they had. Which is why the second study, this time of 178 people, is so interesting. The participants were asked to think of a time that week they had missed a deadline. Those who described themselves as busy were the ones most likely to say the missed deadline was due to an unexpected cause beyond their control. Were they just pointing fingers? Perhaps. But the disappointment they felt still motivated them to try harder in a bid to make up for it, which was also replicated in the third study. It was the fourth one, however, that was among the most trustworthy because it moved away from how people perceive themselves and more towards how they react in real-world environments. Students were told they'd be given cash if they finished a task early. Those who missed the deadline were asked if they were busy at the time they missed it. If they were indeed busy, they were then more likely to complete the task faster than those who were idle. In other words, having more time on your hands, at least in the context of deadlines, makes you less productive.",Recent research indicates all this busyness may not be such a bad thing after all.

After seeing the unknown man shoot, Grimmie’s brother immediately tackled him. During the struggle, the man, now known as Kevin James Loibl, shot himself. When the police arrived rising star Grimmie was critical and Loibl was pronounced dead on the scene.

According to NBC News, local police officers are still investigating and trying to understand Loibl’s motivation and intent on killing Grimmie. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said that despite their scouring for information, they found no connection between Loibl and Grimmie.

“The suspect travelled to Orlando apparently to commit this crime and then had plans to travel back to where he came from,” Mina told the reporters.

The most probable theory regarding Grimmie’s death is the Loibl was a deranged fan.

Grimmie’s brother Marcus was praised by the police for his immediate reaction that “could have prevented further loss of life” and injuries to innocent people.

ABC News reports that 27-year old Loibl was carrying two handguns and one hunting knife. Loibl came from St. Petersburg, Florida. The Plaza Live, where the shooting happened, was not equipped with metal detectors. Guards would only search the 120 people who have tickets to go in.

St. Petersburg Police Department spokesman Rick Shaw said that there was nothing about Loibl that could have led him to commit murder. He was never arrested. His record is only composed of petty theft, a battery accident and a car accident.

After the struggle in the concert venue, Grimmie was immediately transported to a local hospital where she died because of her critical injuries.

“It is with a heavy heart that we can confirm that Christina has passed and went home to be with the Lord,” Grimmie’s publicist Heather Weiss said, as reported by The Guardian. “We ask at this time that you respect the privacy of her family and friends in their time of mourning.”

Fans and mentors turn to social media to express their grief. Some of them remember Grimmie by reminiscing what she had done in “The Voice” especially her blind audition where she sang a Goosebumps -worthy rendition of Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball.” Grimmie was 22 years old and loved by many.","During a meet and greet with her fans, Christina Grimmie was fatally shot in Orlando, Florida on Friday night."

Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday a Polk County deputy saw a black bear at State Road 60 and 80 Foot Road in Bartow. The bear continued walking on 80 Foot Road towards Wells Road.

The deputy contacted dispatch requested that Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) respond to the area. The deputy followed the bear while waiting for FWC to respond.

The 6 foot 300 pound bear climb a fence and enter into a pig pen on 5615 Wells Road. The deputy witnessed the bear attacking the pig. Screams from the pig can be heard in video shot by a witness.

Fearing for the safety of the pig, the deputy shot the bear with his agency-issued shotgun in the lower back to stop that attack on the pig. After being shot once, the bear charged at the deputy, the deputy discharged two more rounds and killed the bear.

The pig survived the attack and did not require medical attention.

Sheriff Grady Judd issued this statement on the deputy:

""There is no such thing as a routine call in law enforcement. I'm proud of this deputy, who saw a potential threat by a wild animal, immediately took action, and placed himself in a position not only to protect human life, but also someone's livestock. Because he was in the right place at the right time, the bear did not kill or maim anyone or anything,"" Sheriff Judd said.",A bear was shot and killed after attacking a domestic pig in Polk County.

LOUIS, Mo. (Christian Examiner) – It has been nearly 20 years since the Southern Baptist Convention met for its annual meeting in St. Louis with 25,607 registered messengers in the midst of the Conservative Resurgence.

It was there, at the Gateway City to the West, after years marked by passionate discussions over liberalism, neo-orthodoxy and inerrancy, the SBC approved a report from ""The Peace Committee"" formed in 1985 to determine the sources of controversy in the SBC and recommend how it could be resolved.

As Southern Baptists prepare to meet for this year's June 14-15 annual meeting, pre-registration is up over 50 percent of 2015 levels, with a projected 10-11,000 total number of attendees, according to Baptist Press.

Those numbers still fall short, however, of the norms two decades ago, and at least one former Southern Baptist executive, and a longtime pastor, speculate the ""stealth"" nature of newer controversies may in fact be frustrating enough to cause some to stay away, while a current leader calls on pastors to attend the convention and ""respond accordingly"" to what he says is important business at the SBC.

Others have speculated the once-mammoth Southern Baptist Convention, with its 46,499 congregations and over 15.5 million members, is in what Christianity Today last year coined a ""terminal decline"" despite its growing emphasis on church planting – and the decline in participation in the annual meeting reflects an overall decline.

Morris Chapman, the former president and CEO of the SBC Executive Committee (1992-2010), told Christian Examiner he believes that by 2004 the objectives of the Peace Committee were met in relation to the Conservative Resurgence. At that point, he said, ""everyone was getting wary, even the conservatives, (because) we just can't argue and debate full time forever.""

The issues discussed between 1979-2004 specifically, he said, were different from now and grassroots messengers to the convention were led to vote their convictions by pastors such Adrian Rogers and Paige Patterson.

""I don't think what is happening right now is identified,"" Chapman said, ""expect by a few who are paying attention.""

When probed, Chapman said he believes that a discussion which may have started over different theological views – namely between Calvinists and those who are not – has turned into a political struggle.

""And in that vein, the issue of Calvinism has taken on a certain voting emphasis that I don't think it ever has had in history,"" he said. It has a tone of ""I'm right and you are not.""

Chapman, who served as a pastor for 25 years, as well as a president of the SBC before becoming its top administrative leader, said that before he eventually retired he noted a movement was gaining momentum that was different than the Conservative Resurgence, but largely flying under the radar.

""We are discussing the elephant in the room, and there's more of a stealth movement that is occurring, and nevertheless it is real and will have an impact on the convention – good or bad – whatever the case becomes.""

Chapman, 75, said he plans to attend the SBC in St. Louis this year, and hopes folks don't forget that the SBC is made up of small churches ""where the pastor and the people love the Lord,"" he said. ""I never want to forget what it was like to serve my earliest churches.""

Bob Hadley, a Florida pastor, told Christian Examiner he doesn't like the direction the Southern Baptist Convention is going, but sees no way to stop it – despite assurances the meeting still allows for business.

""There is really nothing that you do at the SBC annual meeting now that has any consequences with the exception of electing the president,"" Hadley said.

Beyond the election of a president, Hadley is referring to the fact that the SBC's Executive Committee, the North American Mission Board, the International Mission Board, LifeWay Christian Resources, and the SBC's six seminaries are governed by trustee boards, and not by the convention.

""There is no voice,"" said Hadley, who has been an SBC pastor for 40 years. His church, until 2015, contributed regularly to the Cooperative Program, Southern Baptists' mechanism for funding missions and ministry, he said, but no longer adds its support. His church does, however, partner with local churches to contribute resources to its local association and supports the Florida Baptist Children's Home, he said.

Throughout the years, Hadley said he became disenfranchised with his denomination which he said increasingly appeared to promote Calvinism, a particular soteriological view — and its adherents — above others, to the point of drowning out those who ""dissent.""

""Like a woman who is eight-and-a-half-months pregnant and who is just now starting to show,"" Hadley said there has been an orchestrated effort to promote certain viewpoints at the expense of others in leadership throughout the various SBC entities and on SBC boards.

The result, he said, has led to the kind of apathy or hopelessness that affects not only attendance at the SBC annual meetings, but giving to SBC causes and growing as a denomination. And unlike the SBC of the past he said was a bottom up organization where the messengers gave direction, he sees the SBC as becoming a top-down organization with certain leaders calling the shots.

""When you disagree with the direction the convention has gone, there is no reason to bring my fire extinguisher to the fire,"" Hadley said. ""I like to bring my flame thrower, to fight fire with fire. But in this situation, there is no flame-thrower to stop this mess.

""The SBC as we know it is gone,"" continued Hadley. ""The annual convention cannot do anything. It is a façade. It is not a business meeting. It is a big time for people to report what they want you to know. It is a big time for people to say, 'Sit down and shut up and we will tell you what we want you to do. If you dissent, you are the problem.'""

Hadley said that outside of taking a vacation and connecting with friends, he sees no reason to attend the SBC.

Jeff Robinson, a senior editor for The Gospel Coalition, church planter, and adjunct professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in a blog article ""6 Reasons pastors and future pastors should attend the SBC annual meeting,"" posted at the Southern Seminary website, writes that he remembers his parents riding a church bus for 15 hours to Dallas to participate in the SBC during the Conservative Resurgence in 1985.

Thirty years later, Robinson encourages pastors, student/pastors, and future pastors to attend.

""Pastors need each other,"" Robinson said in his first point. They also need to know how the denomination functions, he emphasized in his second point.

""Obviously, the denomination continues to run the other 363 days through various entities as the Executive Committee, NAMB, IMB, Baptist Press, the six seminaries, a number of standing committees, and more. But business that drives the remainder of the year is done the second week in June,"" Robinson wrote. ""Thus, these two days are very important and those who lead in local churches should respond accordingly.""

Noting Crossover, an evangelism event the Saturday prior to the meeting, Robinson said, ""evangelism and missions are the one consistent refrain to SBC meetings over the decades.""

Denominations continue to matter, Robinson said, while noting a trend among ""younger evangelicals"" to the contrary.

Pointing to what he called ""secondary theological matters within the SBC,"" Robinson asserted his assumption there is ""broad agreement"" on doctrines set forth in Southern Baptists' confession of faith, the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.

In his closing points, Robinson urges pastors of small churches to participate in the meeting as a messenger, and to take other members, ""particularly young men"" interested in ministry. This effort could promote a spirit of cooperation among pastors and churches,"" drawing them from all over the country to achieve a ""big tent"" environment, he said.

""Our annual meeting is an excellent reminder that we are together for the gospel, together to promote the fame of Jesus and his redeeming love for sinners,"" Robinson wrote. ""If you are a pastor or plan on being a pastor, I hope to see you next week in St. Louis.""

Debates about SBC entities, policies, and leaders, have resulted in a variety of news stories, blog entries, and commentaries. In brief, they are:
• SBC Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission president Russell Moore was the subject of an editorial by Georgia Christian Index editor Gerald Harris. Harris took Moore to task for supporting the building of a mosque in New Jersey. He asked: ""[W]hy would Dr. Moore spend his professional capital to defend the religious liberty of Muslims in New Jersey to build a mosque and fail to exert the same energy to get involved in Georgia's quest to pass religious liberty legislation earlier this year?""

Moore has also often been in the news over comments he has made about Republican nominee for president Donald Trump.
• SBC pastors have signed a petition calling for a Pepper-Hamilton-Baylor like investigation into NAMB president Kevin Ezell in response to allegations made by Will McRaney, former Executive Director of the Mid-Atlantic Baptist Network. Some state executives responded, as did Ezell.
• news inside and outside evangelical circles when what was termed a voluntary drawdown of 600 missionaries nearly doubled with 1,132 missionaries and staff resigning or retiring, with incentives. IMB president David Platt also announced the termination of 30 seasoned Baptist missions communicators as part of the organization's ""reset.""

""IMB is now in a much healthier financial position,"" Platt said during IMB's Feb. 22-24 meeting near Richmond, Virginia. ""Due to increased giving from Southern Baptist churches, Cooperative Program and Lottie Moon Christmas Offering giving are trending upward.""

Will Hall, editor of the Baptist Message, the state Baptist paper in Louisiana, in an editorial raised fifteen questions about the management practices and philosophy of the International Mission Board that he said remain unanswered despite multiple attempts on his part to get answers.
• LifeWay Christian Resources has continued to downsize its physical property by selling its historic 15-acre property in downtown Nashville and planning move to a 3-acre property nearby, after selling its 2,400-acre Glorieta Conference Center in New Mexico in 2013 for $1 to investors.

After recently announcing his resignation from LifeWay Research, Ed Stetzer, a popular statistician, and the general editor of The Gospel Project, began to serve as the executive director of the Billy Graham Center for Evangelism at Wheaton College in Chicago. Stetzer's resignation was followed by the announcement of Micah Fries, vice president of LifeWay Research, who said he is stepping down in view of a call to the pastorate.

The Gospel Project, according to an article released in 2012, had more than 300,000 users as part of 40,000 different groups at its introduction -- with many, if not a majority of those, non-Southern Baptist. It is also considered heavily influenced by ""Calvinistic"" writers. Today, the Gospel Project boasts of 1 million in an advertisement on LifeWay's website.

The annual meeting begins Tuesday, June 14 with a highly anticipated presidential election that afternoon and continues through Wednesday, June 15.","It has been nearly 20 years since the Southern Baptist Convention met in St. Louis for its annual meeting with 25,607 registered messengers in the midst of the Conservative Resurgence.

At the other end of the spectrum, Florida had the lowest rate of chronic absenteeism, 4.5 percent in the 2013-14 school year.

Overall, the national average of chronic absenteeism was 13 percent, or about 6.5 million students, the Education Department said.

""Chronic absenteeism is a national problem,"" Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. said in a statement Wednesday. ""Frequent absences from school can be devastating to a child's education.""

Bob Balfanz, a research professor at Johns Hopkins University and director of the Everyone Graduates Center, called the numbers disturbing.

""If you're not there, you don't learn, and then you fall behind. You don't pass your classes. You don't get the credits in high school and that's what leads to dropping out,"" Balfanz said.

The report was the first release of chronic absentee figures from the department.

The Obama administration began a program last fall that now works with states and local groups in 30 communities to identify mentors to help habitually absent kids get back on track. As part of the effort, the White House said Wednesday that a New York-based company, STATE Bags, was donating 30,000 backpacks to children being mentored in the program.

NBA star Kevin Durant is working with the administration on the initiative.

""Sometimes the reasons come down to not having what you need to be present and ready ... like a book bag, school supplies or the support of a caring adult,"" Durant said in a statement.

Detroit is among the new communities to sign up for the My Brother's Keeper Success Mentors Initiative.

Of the 100 largest school districts by enrollment, Detroit had the highest rate of chronic absenteeism.

Nearly 58 percent of students were chronically absent in the 2013-2014 school year.

Alycia Meriweather, interim superintendent of Detroit Public Schools, said Wednesday: ""This is a serious problem, which I would term a leading indicator, that impacts everything else we are trying to accomplish at the District. DPS must address this issue in order to see greater results in our classrooms and schools.""

Meriweather said Detroit was working with absenteeism and behavior experts to address the problem, and hoping to gain ""some new perspectives and ideas"" from the My Brother's Keeper Summit this week in Washington.

In Washington, Michelle Lerner, press secretary for the District of Columbia Schools, said the district is taking an ""all-hands-on-deck approach"" to try to ensure that students attend school.

She said the school system last year met its ""in-seat attendance goal - a measure that shows how many students are actually present on any given day - of 89.5 percent,"" which she said was an improvement over the previous two school years.

""But we still have more work to do to ensure more students continue to be in school every day,"" Lerner said.

Elsewhere around the country, Washington state and Alaska had chronic absentee rates hovering around one-quarter of students with that level of absences.

According to AP's analysis, girls were just as likely as boys to habitually miss school. Nearly 22 percent of all American Indian students were reported as regularly absent, followed by Native Hawaiians at 21 percent and black students at 17 percent. Hispanic and white students were close to the national average of 13 percent.

Students are regularly missing school for lots of reasons, Balfanz says. Many are poor and could be staying home to care for a sibling or helping with elder care. Others are avoiding school because they're being bullied or they worry it's not safe. And then, there are some students who simply skip school.

Schools should be creating welcoming environments to make students feel wanted each day, Balfanz says. They also need to build relationships with the kids who are regularly absent to figure out what's keeping them away, he said.

As part of its Civil Rights Data Collection, the department surveyed all public schools in the country, covering over 95,000 schools and 50 million students. Roughly one in seven of all K-12 public schools nationwide reported having not a single chronically absent student that year.

Chronic absenteeism is one of several topics covered in the data collection. It also looked at school discipline and high-rigor course offerings.

Other figures from the report:

-Black preschool children are 3.6 times as likely to get one or more out-of-school suspensions as their white counterparts.

-Black children represent 19 percent of preschoolers, yet they account for 47 percent of preschool kids getting suspended.

-White students make up 41 percent of preschoolers, and 28 percent of preschool kids with suspensions.

-Nationwide, almost half of high schools offered classes in calculus, and more than three-quarters offered Algebra II.

-33 percent of high schools with substantial black and Latino enrollment offered calculus. That compares to 56 percent of high schools with low numbers of black and Latino children that offered calculus. Similar gaps were seen for physics, chemistry and Algebra II.","WASHINGTON - The problem of students habitually missing school varies widely from state to state, with about one-third of students in the nation's capital absent 15 days or more in a single school ye…"

LOUIS, Mo. (Christian Examiner) – It has been nearly 20 years since the Southern Baptist Convention met for its annual meeting in St. Louis with 25,607 registered messengers in the midst of the Conservative Resurgence.

It was there, at the Gateway City to the West, after years marked by passionate discussions over liberalism, neo-orthodoxy and inerrancy, the SBC approved a report from ""The Peace Committee"" formed in 1985 to determine the sources of controversy in the SBC and recommend how it could be resolved.

As Southern Baptists prepare to meet for this year's June 14-15 annual meeting, pre-registration is up over 50 percent of 2015 levels, with a projected 10-11,000 total number of attendees, according to Baptist Press.

Those numbers still fall short, however, of the norms two decades ago, and at least one former Southern Baptist executive, and a longtime pastor, speculate the ""stealth"" nature of newer controversies may in fact be frustrating enough to cause some to stay away, while a current leader calls on pastors to attend the convention and ""respond accordingly"" to what he says is important business at the SBC.

Others have speculated the once-mammoth Southern Baptist Convention, with its 46,499 congregations and over 15.5 million members, is in what Christianity Today last year coined a ""terminal decline"" despite its growing emphasis on church planting – and the decline in participation in the annual meeting reflects an overall decline.

Morris Chapman, the former president and CEO of the SBC Executive Committee (1992-2010), told Christian Examiner he believes that by 2004 the objectives of the Peace Committee were met in relation to the Conservative Resurgence. At that point, he said, ""everyone was getting wary, even the conservatives, (because) we just can't argue and debate full time forever.""

The issues discussed between 1979-2004 specifically, he said, were different from now and grassroots messengers to the convention were led to vote their convictions by pastors such Adrian Rogers and Paige Patterson.

""I don't think what is happening right now is identified,"" Chapman said, ""expect by a few who are paying attention.""

When probed, Chapman said he believes that a discussion which may have started over different theological views – namely between Calvinists and those who are not – has turned into a political struggle.

""And in that vein, the issue of Calvinism has taken on a certain voting emphasis that I don't think it ever has had in history,"" he said. It has a tone of ""I'm right and you are not.""

Chapman, who served as a pastor for 25 years, as well as a president of the SBC before becoming its top administrative leader, said that before he eventually retired he noted a movement was gaining momentum that was different than the Conservative Resurgence, but largely flying under the radar.

""We are discussing the elephant in the room, and there's more of a stealth movement that is occurring, and nevertheless it is real and will have an impact on the convention – good or bad – whatever the case becomes.""

Chapman, 75, said he plans to attend the SBC in St. Louis this year, and hopes folks don't forget that the SBC is made up of small churches ""where the pastor and the people love the Lord,"" he said. ""I never want to forget what it was like to serve my earliest churches.""

Bob Hadley, a Florida pastor, told Christian Examiner he doesn't like the direction the Southern Baptist Convention is going, but sees no way to stop it – despite assurances the meeting still allows for business.

""There is really nothing that you do at the SBC annual meeting now that has any consequences with the exception of electing the president,"" Hadley said.

Beyond the election of a president, Hadley is referring to the fact that the SBC's Executive Committee, the North American Mission Board, the International Mission Board, LifeWay Christian Resources, and the SBC's six seminaries are governed by trustee boards, and not by the convention.

""There is no voice,"" said Hadley, who has been an SBC pastor for 40 years. His church, until 2015, contributed regularly to the Cooperative Program, Southern Baptists' mechanism for funding missions and ministry, he said, but no longer adds its support. His church does, however, partner with local churches to contribute resources to its local association and supports the Florida Baptist Children's Home, he said.

Throughout the years, Hadley said he became disenfranchised with his denomination which he said increasingly appeared to promote Calvinism, a particular soteriological view — and its adherents — above others, to the point of drowning out those who ""dissent.""

""Like a woman who is eight-and-a-half-months pregnant and who is just now starting to show,"" Hadley said there has been an orchestrated effort to promote certain viewpoints at the expense of others in leadership throughout the various SBC entities and on SBC boards.

The result, he said, has led to the kind of apathy or hopelessness that affects not only attendance at the SBC annual meetings, but giving to SBC causes and growing as a denomination. And unlike the SBC of the past he said was a bottom up organization where the messengers gave direction, he sees the SBC as becoming a top-down organization with certain leaders calling the shots.

""When you disagree with the direction the convention has gone, there is no reason to bring my fire extinguisher to the fire,"" Hadley said. ""I like to bring my flame thrower, to fight fire with fire. But in this situation, there is no flame-thrower to stop this mess.

""The SBC as we know it is gone,"" continued Hadley. ""The annual convention cannot do anything. It is a façade. It is not a business meeting. It is a big time for people to report what they want you to know. It is a big time for people to say, 'Sit down and shut up and we will tell you what we want you to do. If you dissent, you are the problem.'""

Hadley said that outside of taking a vacation and connecting with friends, he sees no reason to attend the SBC.

Jeff Robinson, a senior editor for The Gospel Coalition, church planter, and adjunct professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in a blog article ""6 Reasons pastors and future pastors should attend the SBC annual meeting,"" posted at the Southern Seminary website, writes that he remembers his parents riding a church bus for 15 hours to Dallas to participate in the SBC during the Conservative Resurgence in 1985.

Thirty years later, Robinson encourages pastors, student/pastors, and future pastors to attend.

""Pastors need each other,"" Robinson said in his first point. They also need to know how the denomination functions, he emphasized in his second point.

""Obviously, the denomination continues to run the other 363 days through various entities as the Executive Committee, NAMB, IMB, Baptist Press, the six seminaries, a number of standing committees, and more. But business that drives the remainder of the year is done the second week in June,"" Robinson wrote. ""Thus, these two days are very important and those who lead in local churches should respond accordingly.""

Noting Crossover, an evangelism event the Saturday prior to the meeting, Robinson said, ""evangelism and missions are the one consistent refrain to SBC meetings over the decades.""

Denominations continue to matter, Robinson said, while noting a trend among ""younger evangelicals"" to the contrary.

Pointing to what he called ""secondary theological matters within the SBC,"" Robinson asserted his assumption there is ""broad agreement"" on doctrines set forth in Southern Baptists' confession of faith, the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.

In his closing points, Robinson urges pastors of small churches to participate in the meeting as a messenger, and to take other members, ""particularly young men"" interested in ministry. This effort could promote a spirit of cooperation among pastors and churches,"" drawing them from all over the country to achieve a ""big tent"" environment, he said.

""Our annual meeting is an excellent reminder that we are together for the gospel, together to promote the fame of Jesus and his redeeming love for sinners,"" Robinson wrote. ""If you are a pastor or plan on being a pastor, I hope to see you next week in St. Louis.""

Debates about SBC entities, policies, and leaders, have resulted in a variety of news stories, blog entries, and commentaries. In brief, they are:
• SBC Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission president Russell Moore was the subject of an editorial by Georgia Christian Index editor Gerald Harris. Harris took Moore to task for supporting the building of a mosque in New Jersey. He asked: ""[W]hy would Dr. Moore spend his professional capital to defend the religious liberty of Muslims in New Jersey to build a mosque and fail to exert the same energy to get involved in Georgia's quest to pass religious liberty legislation earlier this year?""

Moore has also often been in the news over comments he has made about Republican nominee for president Donald Trump.
• SBC pastors have signed a petition calling for a Pepper-Hamilton-Baylor like investigation into NAMB president Kevin Ezell in response to allegations made by Will McRaney, former Executive Director of the Mid-Atlantic Baptist Network. Some state executives responded, as did Ezell.

LOUIS, Mo. (Christian Examiner) – It has been nearly 20 years since the Southern Baptist Convention met for its annual meeting in St. Louis with 25,607 registered messengers in the midst of the Conservative Resurgence.

It was there, at the Gateway City to the West, after years marked by passionate discussions over liberalism, neo-orthodoxy and inerrancy, the SBC approved a report from ""The Peace Committee"" formed in 1985 to determine the sources of controversy in the SBC and recommend how it could be resolved.

As Southern Baptists prepare to meet for this year's June 14-15 annual meeting, pre-registration is up over 50 percent of 2015 levels, with a projected 10-11,000 total number of attendees, according to Baptist Press.

Those numbers still fall short, however, of the norms two decades ago, and at least one former Southern Baptist executive, and a longtime pastor, speculate the ""stealth"" nature of newer controversies may in fact be frustrating enough to cause some to stay away, while a current leader calls on pastors to attend the convention and ""respond accordingly"" to what he says is important business at the SBC.

Others have speculated the once-mammoth Southern Baptist Convention, with its 46,499 congregations and over 15.5 million members, is in what Christianity Today last year coined a ""terminal decline"" despite its growing emphasis on church planting – and the decline in participation in the annual meeting reflects an overall decline.

Morris Chapman, the former president and CEO of the SBC Executive Committee (1992-2010), told Christian Examiner he believes that by 2004 the objectives of the Peace Committee were met in relation to the Conservative Resurgence. At that point, he said, ""everyone was getting wary, even the conservatives, (because) we just can't argue and debate full time forever.""

The issues discussed between 1979-2004 specifically, he said, were different from now and grassroots messengers to the convention were led to vote their convictions by pastors such Adrian Rogers and Paige Patterson.

""I don't think what is happening right now is identified,"" Chapman said, ""expect by a few who are paying attention.""

When probed, Chapman said he believes that a discussion which may have started over different theological views – namely between Calvinists and those who are not – has turned into a political struggle.

""And in that vein, the issue of Calvinism has taken on a certain voting emphasis that I don't think it ever has had in history,"" he said. It has a tone of ""I'm right and you are not.""

Chapman, who served as a pastor for 25 years, as well as a president of the SBC before becoming its top administrative leader, said that before he eventually retired he noted a movement was gaining momentum that was different than the Conservative Resurgence, but largely flying under the radar.

""We are discussing the elephant in the room, and there's more of a stealth movement that is occurring, and nevertheless it is real and will have an impact on the convention – good or bad – whatever the case becomes.""

Chapman, 75, said he plans to attend the SBC in St. Louis this year, and hopes folks don't forget that the SBC is made up of small churches ""where the pastor and the people love the Lord,"" he said. ""I never want to forget what it was like to serve my earliest churches.""

Bob Hadley, a Florida pastor, told Christian Examiner he doesn't like the direction the Southern Baptist Convention is going, but sees no way to stop it – despite assurances the meeting still allows for business.

""There is really nothing that you do at the SBC annual meeting now that has any consequences with the exception of electing the president,"" Hadley said.

Beyond the election of a president, Hadley is referring to the fact that the SBC's Executive Committee, the North American Mission Board, the International Mission Board, LifeWay Christian Resources, and the SBC's six seminaries are governed by trustee boards, and not by the convention.

""There is no voice,"" said Hadley, who has been an SBC pastor for 40 years. His church, until 2015, contributed regularly to the Cooperative Program, Southern Baptists' mechanism for funding missions and ministry, he said, but no longer adds its support. His church does, however, partner with local churches to contribute resources to its local association and supports the Florida Baptist Children's Home, he said.

Throughout the years, Hadley said he became disenfranchised with his denomination which he said increasingly appeared to promote Calvinism, a particular soteriological view — and its adherents — above others, to the point of drowning out those who ""dissent.""

""Like a woman who is eight-and-a-half-months pregnant and who is just now starting to show,"" Hadley said there has been an orchestrated effort to promote certain viewpoints at the expense of others in leadership throughout the various SBC entities and on SBC boards.

The result, he said, has led to the kind of apathy or hopelessness that affects not only attendance at the SBC annual meetings, but giving to SBC causes and growing as a denomination. And unlike the SBC of the past he said was a bottom up organization where the messengers gave direction, he sees the SBC as becoming a top-down organization with certain leaders calling the shots.

""When you disagree with the direction the convention has gone, there is no reason to bring my fire extinguisher to the fire,"" Hadley said. ""I like to bring my flame thrower, to fight fire with fire. But in this situation, there is no flame-thrower to stop this mess.

""The SBC as we know it is gone,"" continued Hadley. ""The annual convention cannot do anything. It is a façade. It is not a business meeting. It is a big time for people to report what they want you to know. It is a big time for people to say, 'Sit down and shut up and we will tell you what we want you to do. If you dissent, you are the problem.'""

Hadley said that outside of taking a vacation and connecting with friends, he sees no reason to attend the SBC.

Jeff Robinson, a senior editor for The Gospel Coalition, church planter, and adjunct professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in a blog article ""6 Reasons pastors and future pastors should attend the SBC annual meeting,"" posted at the Southern Seminary website, writes that he remembers his parents riding a church bus for 15 hours to Dallas to participate in the SBC during the Conservative Resurgence in 1985.

Thirty years later, Robinson encourages pastors, student/pastors, and future pastors to attend.

""Pastors need each other,"" Robinson said in his first point. They also need to know how the denomination functions, he emphasized in his second point.

""Obviously, the denomination continues to run the other 363 days through various entities as the Executive Committee, NAMB, IMB, Baptist Press, the six seminaries, a number of standing committees, and more. But business that drives the remainder of the year is done the second week in June,"" Robinson wrote. ""Thus, these two days are very important and those who lead in local churches should respond accordingly.""

Noting Crossover, an evangelism event the Saturday prior to the meeting, Robinson said, ""evangelism and missions are the one consistent refrain to SBC meetings over the decades.""

Denominations continue to matter, Robinson said, while noting a trend among ""younger evangelicals"" to the contrary.

Pointing to what he called ""secondary theological matters within the SBC,"" Robinson asserted his assumption there is ""broad agreement"" on doctrines set forth in Southern Baptists' confession of faith, the Baptist Faith and Message 2000.

In his closing points, Robinson urges pastors of small churches to participate in the meeting as a messenger, and to take other members, ""particularly young men"" interested in ministry. This effort could promote a spirit of cooperation among pastors and churches,"" drawing them from all over the country to achieve a ""big tent"" environment, he said.

""Our annual meeting is an excellent reminder that we are together for the gospel, together to promote the fame of Jesus and his redeeming love for sinners,"" Robinson wrote. ""If you are a pastor or plan on being a pastor, I hope to see you next week in St. Louis.""

Debates about SBC entities, policies, and leaders, have resulted in a variety of news stories, blog entries, and commentaries. In brief, they are:
• SBC Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission president Russell Moore was the subject of an editorial by Georgia Christian Index editor Gerald Harris. Harris took Moore to task for supporting the building of a mosque in New Jersey. He asked: ""[W]hy would Dr. Moore spend his professional capital to defend the religious liberty of Muslims in New Jersey to build a mosque and fail to exert the same energy to get involved in Georgia's quest to pass religious liberty legislation earlier this year?""

Moore has also often been in the news over comments he has made about Republican nominee for president Donald Trump.
• SBC pastors have signed a petition calling for a Pepper-Hamilton-Baylor like investigation into NAMB president Kevin Ezell in response to allegations made by Will McRaney, former Executive Director of the Mid-Atlantic Baptist Network. Some state executives responded, as did Ezell.

They belong to a graduate student who became homeless while enrolled at the university and found shelter with the nonprofit Homeless Helping Homeless. The apartment, which can accommodate up to four people at a time, is the first emergency housing shelter in the area and one of few nationwide dedicated to college students who become homeless.

""Right now, all the area shelters are busy setting up the cogs, and there's a cogwheel for pregnant women, and veterans and women with children, but there's no cogwheel for students,"" said Bryan Booth, spokesman for Homeless Helping Homeless. ""We're hoping this can become the first homeless center for USF so students who are couch surfing or staying in shelters can come here and get all the help they need.""

With contributions from Booth and a handful of faculty members at USF, Homeless Helping Homeless opened the shelter last week, complete with an extensive system of security cameras, a computer with Wi-Fi, and furnished bedrooms. The $600 paid by the organization each month in rent also gives its residents access to a community pool.

Homeless Helping Homeless began passing out fliers advertising the new shelter just last week, while students are in the middle of summer sessions, but the group already has one resident.

There's little information available on how many college students are homeless, but a 2013 report found that 58,000 students among 20.2 million nationwide reported they were homeless on their FAFSA forms — Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

Officials with the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth say actual numbers are much higher than reflected in the federal data.

""So many students don't check that box because there's so much shame and guilt,"" said Cyekeia Lee, director of higher education initiatives for the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth. ""No one else is tracking these students so there's no way to determine a number, but from having worked in higher education for over a decade I can tell you there are far more, probably double that.""

Adding to the estimates is an increasing number of homeless children in kindergarten through 12th grade, which reached 1.3 million last school year and could translate to a rise in homelessness among students transitioning to college, said Barbara Duffield, director of policy and programs for NAEHCY.

""There's also more awareness,"" Duffield said. ""More schools are becoming aware students don't have a place to stay or are struggling to eat while in college.""

USF joined most other Florida universities in September by opening an on-campus food pantry, called Feed-A-Bull. There are now 320 active on-campus food pantries across the nation, according to the nonprofit College and University Food Bank Alliance. In 2008, only about four such groups existed.

Food pantries at USF, the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Central Florida logged more than 16,000 visits from students last year. USF's pantry has fed more than 200 students since its opening, distributing about 6,000 pounds of food.

Other schools, like the University of North Florida, have even established Homeless Student Services offices for students to get help securing resources like medical care and employment assistance.

When homeless students come looking for help at USF, they are assigned a case manager who helps them identify available resources, such as local homeless shelters, food banks and financial aid, said Makenzie Schiemann, director of the Office of Student Outreach and Support. Florida is one of two states providing a ""homeless tuition waiver"" that covers verified homeless students' tuition and fees.

""It's an ever-evolving, ever- changing number,"" Schiemann said. ""The homeless students we are working with are temporarily homeless, and it would be helpful to have a place for them to be where they're surrounded by a community more like them that will be supportive as they try to go through school.""

Stagnant levels of financial aid and rising housing costs pinch students' pockets.

At USF, about 91 percent of nearly 42,000 students received some form of financial aid during the 2014-15 school year, according to the university. Of those, about 16,700 received need-based aid, based on household income.

Even though enrollment has grown slightly in recent years, the number of students receiving financial aid has shrunk since the 2012-13 school year, when about 39,000 USF students received some form of aid with college tuition, about 18,400 of them need-based.

Full time undergraduate tuition at USF for the fall and spring semester during the 2016-2017 school year is $6,410 for Florida residents and $17,324 for students from out of state. When housing, meals, books, supplies and other expenses are added in, the USF website tells students to plan on spending $21,110 in a school year if they're Florida residents and $32,024 if they're non-residents.

For graduate students, those costs increase to an estimated $26,278 per school year for Florida residents and $36,976 a year for non-residents.

In Tampa, 22 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and the average income per person is $29,704, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Booth calls the new apartment shelter TANSTAAFL House, which stands for: ""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch."" Students can live in the apartment rent-free for up to 30 days, well over the usual three free days offered by area shelters.

After the 30 days are up, students can stay in the apartment for the next 60 days at $7.50 a day and the 90 days after that for $10 a day — giving them up to half a year to get back on their feet. Students are encouraged to pay back Homeless Helping Homeless when they can, but their contract says the agency quits asking after five years and no legal action will be taken to recoup costs.

""It's just an honorary thing where we're hoping they'll give back, and we're hoping they'll give back 20-fold or 40-fold,"" Booth said. ""USF students have a lot more resources than most homeless people, and they should be able to get rapidly rehoused or get diverted from homelessness, get hooked up with a roommate or a work-study job. There are all kinds of possibilities.""

For Booth, providing at-risk students with a stable form of support is a personal mission. He spent the last seven years at USF getting a doctorate degree in geosciences, five of those years teaching classes as a graduate assistant. He soon came to realize that one or two students in his classes were homeless, as was another graduate student taking urban planning classes alongside him.

""If you go on campus late at night you see people sleeping in nooks and crannies, or you see people in the computer labs at 3 or 4 in the morning,"" Booth said. ""You look for the physical signs, a body stench, which means a lack of shower facilities, or a very large, overflowing bag which is, sometimes, noticeably dirty.""

They belong to a graduate student who became homeless while enrolled at the university and found shelter with the nonprofit Homeless Helping Homeless. The apartment, which can accommodate up to four people at a time, is the first emergency housing shelter in the area and one of few nationwide dedicated to college students who become homeless.

""Right now, all the area shelters are busy setting up the cogs, and there's a cogwheel for pregnant women, and veterans and women with children, but there's no cogwheel for students,"" said Bryan Booth, spokesman for Homeless Helping Homeless. ""We're hoping this can become the first homeless center for USF so students who are couch surfing or staying in shelters can come here and get all the help they need.""

With contributions from Booth and a handful of faculty members at USF, Homeless Helping Homeless opened the shelter last week, complete with an extensive system of security cameras, a computer with Wi-Fi, and furnished bedrooms. The $600 paid by the organization each month in rent also gives its residents access to a community pool.

Homeless Helping Homeless began passing out fliers advertising the new shelter just last week, while students are in the middle of summer sessions, but the group already has one resident.

There's little information available on how many college students are homeless, but a 2013 report found that 58,000 students among 20.2 million nationwide reported they were homeless on their FAFSA forms — Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

Officials with the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth say actual numbers are much higher than reflected in the federal data.

""So many students don't check that box because there's so much shame and guilt,"" said Cyekeia Lee, director of higher education initiatives for the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth. ""No one else is tracking these students so there's no way to determine a number, but from having worked in higher education for over a decade I can tell you there are far more, probably double that.""

Adding to the estimates is an increasing number of homeless children in kindergarten through 12th grade, which reached 1.3 million last school year and could translate to a rise in homelessness among students transitioning to college, said Barbara Duffield, director of policy and programs for NAEHCY.

""There's also more awareness,"" Duffield said. ""More schools are becoming aware students don't have a place to stay or are struggling to eat while in college.""

USF joined most other Florida universities in September by opening an on-campus food pantry, called Feed-A-Bull. There are now 320 active on-campus food pantries across the nation, according to the nonprofit College and University Food Bank Alliance. In 2008, only about four such groups existed.

Food pantries at USF, the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of Central Florida logged more than 16,000 visits from students last year. USF's pantry has fed more than 200 students since its opening, distributing about 6,000 pounds of food.

Other schools, like the University of North Florida, have even established Homeless Student Services offices for students to get help securing resources like medical care and employment assistance.

When homeless students come looking for help at USF, they are assigned a case manager who helps them identify available resources, such as local homeless shelters, food banks and financial aid, said Makenzie Schiemann, director of the Office of Student Outreach and Support. Florida is one of two states providing a ""homeless tuition waiver"" that covers verified homeless students' tuition and fees.

""It's an ever-evolving, ever- changing number,"" Schiemann said. ""The homeless students we are working with are temporarily homeless, and it would be helpful to have a place for them to be where they're surrounded by a community more like them that will be supportive as they try to go through school.""

Stagnant levels of financial aid and rising housing costs pinch students' pockets.

At USF, about 91 percent of nearly 42,000 students received some form of financial aid during the 2014-15 school year, according to the university. Of those, about 16,700 received need-based aid, based on household income.

Even though enrollment has grown slightly in recent years, the number of students receiving financial aid has shrunk since the 2012-13 school year, when about 39,000 USF students received some form of aid with college tuition, about 18,400 of them need-based.

Full time undergraduate tuition at USF for the fall and spring semester during the 2016-2017 school year is $6,410 for Florida residents and $17,324 for students from out of state. When housing, meals, books, supplies and other expenses are added in, the USF website tells students to plan on spending $21,110 in a school year if they're Florida residents and $32,024 if they're non-residents.

For graduate students, those costs increase to an estimated $26,278 per school year for Florida residents and $36,976 a year for non-residents.

In Tampa, 22 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and the average income per person is $29,704, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Booth calls the new apartment shelter TANSTAAFL House, which stands for: ""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch."" Students can live in the apartment rent-free for up to 30 days, well over the usual three free days offered by area shelters.

After the 30 days are up, students can stay in the apartment for the next 60 days at $7.50 a day and the 90 days after that for $10 a day — giving them up to half a year to get back on their feet. Students are encouraged to pay back Homeless Helping Homeless when they can, but their contract says the agency quits asking after five years and no legal action will be taken to recoup costs.

""It's just an honorary thing where we're hoping they'll give back, and we're hoping they'll give back 20-fold or 40-fold,"" Booth said. ""USF students have a lot more resources than most homeless people, and they should be able to get rapidly rehoused or get diverted from homelessness, get hooked up with a roommate or a work-study job. There are all kinds of possibilities.""

For Booth, providing at-risk students with a stable form of support is a personal mission. He spent the last seven years at USF getting a doctorate degree in geosciences, five of those years teaching classes as a graduate assistant. He soon came to realize that one or two students in his classes were homeless, as was another graduate student taking urban planning classes alongside him.

""If you go on campus late at night you see people sleeping in nooks and crannies, or you see people in the computer labs at 3 or 4 in the morning,"" Booth said. ""You look for the physical signs, a body stench, which means a lack of shower facilities, or a very large, overflowing bag which is, sometimes, noticeably dirty.""

For now, there are plans for Homeless Helping Homeless to run the program until December, after which Booth said he would like to make the shelter the focus of a faculty charity. Many among the faculty have expressed an interest in helping, he said.

“You’ve got to know when to hold ‘em,” Kenny Rogers sings in the country music classic. “Know when to fold ‘em. Know when to walk away. And know when to run.”

Two South Florida senators decided to fold ‘em by leaving the Legislature — including one whose retirement followed four decades of public service and an inflammatory comment that could have made her re-election bid particularly tough. Two more lawmakers from Palm Beach County decided to run, but for each other’s seats.

Officials at Florida A&M were deciding whether to walk away from Elmira Mangum, the embattled president of the state’s only historically black public university.

Meanwhile, gambling itself was before the Florida Supreme Court, but largely got lost in a deck full of cases and decisions dealing with everything from the death penalty to the state’s workers’ compensation system.

Supporters of the workers’ comp provision struck down by the justices warned that it would harm business — another area where the Gambler had some advice. “You never count your money when you’re sittin’ at the table. There’ll be time enough for countin’ when the dealin’s done.”

A colleague once compared Sen. Gwen Margolis, D-Miami, to Mount Rushmore for her long record of service and sizable reputation in South Florida. But that reputation took a beating after Margolis sounded dismissive of the heritage of some of her political opponents this week, something that likely led to her decision to end her elected career.

She was elected to the House in 1974, rose to become the first female Senate president in 1990, served on the Dade County Commission and was on her third stint in the Senate when she decided to retire.

“I am guided by the belief that one must leave your community a better place from where you started,” the 81-year-old Margolis said in a statement issued Thursday by her campaign. “Today, I am proud to say that we have done that. The last 40 years have been a blessing because so many milestones and history-making moments were reached on behalf of Miami-Dade and Florida. ”

Margolis didn’t reference the imbroglio over her colorful analysis of the Democratic primary in Senate District 38. The Miami Herald reported that, at a Monday campaign event, Margolis allegedly said it was “reprehensible that three Haitians, some teacher and some lawyer think that they have the right to run against me.”

Three of the remaining five District 38 Democratic primary candidates — accountant Anis Blémur, former state Rep. Phillip Brutus and state Rep. Daphne Campbell — are Haitian-Americans, and some of them started putting pressure on Margolis after the comments became public.

“It is truly sad that Sen. Margolis would stoop that low just because she has competition,” Brutus said. “What is reprehensible is the fact that Gwen Margolis, a public figure, thought it acceptable to attack the Haitian community the way she did.”

The teacher is Don Festge and the lawyer is Jason Pizzo, an attorney from North Miami Beach.

Margolis wasn’t the only female senator from the southern part of the state who decided to leave. Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach, told The Palm Beach Post that she was departing the upper chamber two years earlier than expected to focus on running a nonprofit, the Coalition Against Human Trafficking.

Meanwhile, Rep. Kevin Rader and Sen. Joseph Abruzzo said they would swap seats — with Rader, D-Delray Beach, seeking a spot in the Senate while Abruzzo, D-Boynton Beach, returns to the House.

All the moves were driven to some extent by a court-ordered redistricting plan for the state Senate. Margolis was in a redrawn District 38 because of that decision. Sachs, Abruzzo and Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, were in the middle of trying to figure out how to unscramble a three-incumbent pile-up in the district where they all lived, and part of that involved Abruzzo moving to a district where he didn’t live, but Rader did.

The other branches of government were overwhelmed this week to some extent by the barrage of news coming out of the Florida Supreme Court. Justices dealt with cases on gambling, the death penalty, medical malpractice and the open carrying of firearms.

The gambling case centers on a tiny horse track that is trying to convince the court that it should have slot machines, even without the express approval of the Legislature.

Lawyers for Gretna Racing in Gadsden County and the state traded at-times semantic arguments concerning a 2009 state law that the track said gave it permission to let voters decide whether slots should be allowed at the pari-mutuel.

Some justices seemed frustrated with the close parsing of the state law involved.

“We can get all wrapped up in all the words and phrases and need an English professor to tell us what these things mean,” Justice R. Fred Lewis said.

Almost as complex were the court’s deliberations over whether the state’s new death penalty law is constitutional and, if so, whether it applies to cases that were already in the pipeline when the law passed in March.

But the arguments Tuesday in the case of Larry Darnell Perry, who was convicted of the 2013 murder of his infant son, did little to clear up the murky situation surrounding a January ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, in a case known as Hurst v. Florida, or a new law approved in response.

“Clearly at this stage in our jurisprudence, we want to make sure that the statute is construed in a constitutional manner so that we don’t have another 15 years of death penalty — if the state wants the death penalty, which apparently it does — in flux,” Justice Barbara Pariente said.

Under Florida’s old law, jurors by a simple majority could recommend the death penalty. Judges would then make findings of fact that “sufficient” aggravating factors, not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, existed for the death sentence to be imposed.

That system was an unconstitutional violation of the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in an 8-1 ruling.

Florida’s new law requires juries to unanimously determine “the existence of at least one aggravating factor” before defendants can be eligible for death sentences. The law also requires at least 10 jurors to recommend the death penalty in order for the sentence to be imposed.

The gun case dealt with whether Floridians should be allowed to carry firearms openly, instead of being required to follow the state’s concealed-carry law. On medical malpractice, the issue was whether non-economic damages, commonly known as pain and suffering damages, should be capped.

Justices did rule on a case dealing with workers’ compensation insurance, issuing a 5-2 decision in favor of Bradley Westphal, a St. Petersburg firefighter who suffered a severe back injury while on the job in 2009. The case focused on a workers’ compensation law that led to Westphal’s benefits being cut off after two years, creating what the Supreme Court described as a “coverage gap.”

“As applied to Westphal, the current workers’ compensation statutory scheme does not just reduce the amount of benefits he would receive … but in fact completely cuts off his ability to receive any disability benefits at all,” said the majority opinion written by Pariente and joined fully by Chief Justice Jorge Labarga and Justices Peggy Quince and James E.C. Perry. Lewis wrote a separate concurring opinion.

The Florida Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America quickly issued statements warning that Thursday’s ruling could hurt businesses. Florida Chamber President and CEO Mark Wilson described it as a “further sign that Florida’s workers’ comp system is under attack.”

FAMU: ‘WORKING FOR THE STUDENTS’ OR ‘DYSFUNCTION’?

Also under siege was Mangum, whose week ended with the university president not knowing exactly how much longer she might have at the helm. The Florida A&M University Board of Trustees on Friday delayed a decision about whether to extend Mangum’s contract, now in its third and final year. The deal expires at the end of March.

The 13-member board has eight new members since a failed attempt to fire Mangum last fall. At that time, Kelvin Lawson — who was elected chairman of the board Friday — was the author of a motion to remove Mangum for “incurable cause.”

“I think some of us that have been around longer have a slightly better perspective,” he said Friday. “I think the other board members are going to have to go through that review and then probably get (last year’s evaluation) as a point of comparison to decide if anything at all needs to happen, or if the president’s just allowed to work out the balance of the term of the agreement.”

Mangum said she would not resign.

“The board can do whatever it wants to do,” she said. “I’m here to serve, working for the students, so the board can go line by line, they can extend, they can add, they can change, they can offer options.”

The day before the Friday meeting, a group of former FAMU presidents sent a letter to the board urging trustees not to renew her contract.

“Unfortunately, the disenfranchisement of students, faculty, alumni, staff and community seems to have thrown the university off course,” said the letter, signed by former presidents Frederick Humphries and Fred Gainous and former interim presidents Castell Bryant and Henry Lewis. “We agree that the stalemate that is currently in place creates a culture that will not allow for growth or stability. It is impossible for any university to thrive amid constant dysfunction.”

STORY OF THE WEEK: The South Florida legislative delegation underwent significant changes, with two longtime lawmakers stepping aside and two others deciding to swap their seats.

“You’ve got to know when to hold ‘em,” Kenny Rogers sings in the country music classic. “Know when to fold ‘em. Know when to walk away. And know when to run.”

Two South Florida senators decided to fold ‘em by leaving the Legislature — including one whose retirement followed four decades of public service and an inflammatory comment that could have made her re-election bid particularly tough. Two more lawmakers from Palm Beach County decided to run, but for each other’s seats.

Officials at Florida A&M were deciding whether to walk away from Elmira Mangum, the embattled president of the state’s only historically black public university.

Meanwhile, gambling itself was before the Florida Supreme Court, but largely got lost in a deck full of cases and decisions dealing with everything from the death penalty to the state’s workers’ compensation system.

Supporters of the workers’ comp provision struck down by the justices warned that it would harm business — another area where the Gambler had some advice. “You never count your money when you’re sittin’ at the table. There’ll be time enough for countin’ when the dealin’s done.”

A colleague once compared Sen. Gwen Margolis, D-Miami, to Mount Rushmore for her long record of service and sizable reputation in South Florida. But that reputation took a beating after Margolis sounded dismissive of the heritage of some of her political opponents this week, something that likely led to her decision to end her elected career.

She was elected to the House in 1974, rose to become the first female Senate president in 1990, served on the Dade County Commission and was on her third stint in the Senate when she decided to retire.

“I am guided by the belief that one must leave your community a better place from where you started,” the 81-year-old Margolis said in a statement issued Thursday by her campaign. “Today, I am proud to say that we have done that. The last 40 years have been a blessing because so many milestones and history-making moments were reached on behalf of Miami-Dade and Florida. ”

Margolis didn’t reference the imbroglio over her colorful analysis of the Democratic primary in Senate District 38. The Miami Herald reported that, at a Monday campaign event, Margolis allegedly said it was “reprehensible that three Haitians, some teacher and some lawyer think that they have the right to run against me.”

Three of the remaining five District 38 Democratic primary candidates — accountant Anis Blémur, former state Rep. Phillip Brutus and state Rep. Daphne Campbell — are Haitian-Americans, and some of them started putting pressure on Margolis after the comments became public.

“It is truly sad that Sen. Margolis would stoop that low just because she has competition,” Brutus said. “What is reprehensible is the fact that Gwen Margolis, a public figure, thought it acceptable to attack the Haitian community the way she did.”

The teacher is Don Festge and the lawyer is Jason Pizzo, an attorney from North Miami Beach.

Margolis wasn’t the only female senator from the southern part of the state who decided to leave. Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach, told The Palm Beach Post that she was departing the upper chamber two years earlier than expected to focus on running a nonprofit, the Coalition Against Human Trafficking.

Meanwhile, Rep. Kevin Rader and Sen. Joseph Abruzzo said they would swap seats — with Rader, D-Delray Beach, seeking a spot in the Senate while Abruzzo, D-Boynton Beach, returns to the House.

All the moves were driven to some extent by a court-ordered redistricting plan for the state Senate. Margolis was in a redrawn District 38 because of that decision. Sachs, Abruzzo and Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, were in the middle of trying to figure out how to unscramble a three-incumbent pile-up in the district where they all lived, and part of that involved Abruzzo moving to a district where he didn’t live, but Rader did.

The other branches of government were overwhelmed this week to some extent by the barrage of news coming out of the Florida Supreme Court. Justices dealt with cases on gambling, the death penalty, medical malpractice and the open carrying of firearms.

The gambling case centers on a tiny horse track that is trying to convince the court that it should have slot machines, even without the express approval of the Legislature.

Lawyers for Gretna Racing in Gadsden County and the state traded at-times semantic arguments concerning a 2009 state law that the track said gave it permission to let voters decide whether slots should be allowed at the pari-mutuel.

Some justices seemed frustrated with the close parsing of the state law involved.

“We can get all wrapped up in all the words and phrases and need an English professor to tell us what these things mean,” Justice R. Fred Lewis said.

Almost as complex were the court’s deliberations over whether the state’s new death penalty law is constitutional and, if so, whether it applies to cases that were already in the pipeline when the law passed in March.

But the arguments Tuesday in the case of Larry Darnell Perry, who was convicted of the 2013 murder of his infant son, did little to clear up the murky situation surrounding a January ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, in a case known as Hurst v. Florida, or a new law approved in response.

“Clearly at this stage in our jurisprudence, we want to make sure that the statute is construed in a constitutional manner so that we don’t have another 15 years of death penalty — if the state wants the death penalty, which apparently it does — in flux,” Justice Barbara Pariente said.

Under Florida’s old law, jurors by a simple majority could recommend the death penalty. Judges would then make findings of fact that “sufficient” aggravating factors, not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, existed for the death sentence to be imposed.

That system was an unconstitutional violation of the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in an 8-1 ruling.

Florida’s new law requires juries to unanimously determine “the existence of at least one aggravating factor” before defendants can be eligible for death sentences. The law also requires at least 10 jurors to recommend the death penalty in order for the sentence to be imposed.

The gun case dealt with whether Floridians should be allowed to carry firearms openly, instead of being required to follow the state’s concealed-carry law. On medical malpractice, the issue was whether non-economic damages, commonly known as pain and suffering damages, should be capped.

Justices did rule on a case dealing with workers’ compensation insurance, issuing a 5-2 decision in favor of Bradley Westphal, a St. Petersburg firefighter who suffered a severe back injury while on the job in 2009. The case focused on a workers’ compensation law that led to Westphal’s benefits being cut off after two years, creating what the Supreme Court described as a “coverage gap.”

“As applied to Westphal, the current workers’ compensation statutory scheme does not just reduce the amount of benefits he would receive … but in fact completely cuts off his ability to receive any disability benefits at all,” said the majority opinion written by Pariente and joined fully by Chief Justice Jorge Labarga and Justices Peggy Quince and James E.C. Perry. Lewis wrote a separate concurring opinion.

The Florida Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America quickly issued statements warning that Thursday’s ruling could hurt businesses. Florida Chamber President and CEO Mark Wilson described it as a “further sign that Florida’s workers’ comp system is under attack.”

FAMU: ‘WORKING FOR THE STUDENTS’ OR ‘DYSFUNCTION’?

Also under siege was Mangum, whose week ended with the university president not knowing exactly how much longer she might have at the helm. The Florida A&M University Board of Trustees on Friday delayed a decision about whether to extend Mangum’s contract, now in its third and final year. The deal expires at the end of March.

Two more lawmakers from Palm Beach County decided to run, but for each other’s seats.

Officials at Florida A&M were deciding whether to walk away from Elmira Mangum, the embattled president of the state’s only historically black public university.

Meanwhile, gambling itself was before the Florida Supreme Court, but largely got lost in a deck full of cases and decisions dealing with everything from the death penalty to the state’s workers’ compensation system.

Supporters of the workers’ comp provision struck down by the justices warned that it would harm business — another area where the Gambler had some advice. “You never count your money when you’re sittin’ at the table. There’ll be time enough for countin’ when the dealin’s done.”

A colleague once compared Sen. Gwen Margolis, D-Miami, to Mount Rushmore for her long record of service and sizable reputation in South Florida. But that reputation took a beating after Margolis sounded dismissive of the heritage of some of her political opponents this week, something that likely led to her decision to end her elected career.

She was elected to the House in 1974, rose to become the first female Senate president in 1990, served on the Dade County Commission and was on her third stint in the Senate when she decided to retire.

“I am guided by the belief that one must leave your community a better place from where you started,” the 81-year-old Margolis said in a statement issued Thursday by her campaign. “Today, I am proud to say that we have done that. The last 40 years have been a blessing because so many milestones and history-making moments were reached on behalf of Miami-Dade and Florida. ”

Margolis didn’t reference the imbroglio over her colorful analysis of the Democratic primary in Senate District 38. The Miami Herald reported that, at a Monday campaign event, Margolis allegedly said it was “reprehensible that three Haitians, some teacher and some lawyer think that they have the right to run against me.”

Three of the remaining five District 38 Democratic primary candidates — accountant Anis Blémur, former state Rep. Phillip Brutus and state Rep. Daphne Campbell — are Haitian-Americans, and some of them started putting pressure on Margolis after the comments became public.

“It is truly sad that Sen. Margolis would stoop that low just because she has competition,” Brutus said. “What is reprehensible is the fact that Gwen Margolis, a public figure, thought it acceptable to attack the Haitian community the way she did.”

The teacher is Don Festge and the lawyer is Jason Pizzo, an attorney from North Miami Beach.

Margolis wasn’t the only female senator from the southern part of the state who decided to leave. Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach, told The Palm Beach Post that she was departing the upper chamber two years earlier than expected to focus on running a nonprofit, the Coalition Against Human Trafficking.

Meanwhile, Rep. Kevin Rader and Sen. Joseph Abruzzo said they would swap seats — with Rader, D-Delray Beach, seeking a spot in the Senate while Abruzzo, D-Boynton Beach, returns to the House.

All the moves were driven to some extent by a court-ordered redistricting plan for the state Senate. Margolis was in a redrawn District 38 because of that decision. Sachs, Abruzzo and Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, were in the middle of trying to figure out how to unscramble a three-incumbent pile-up in the district where they all lived, and part of that involved Abruzzo moving to a district where he didn’t live, but Rader did.

The other branches of government were overwhelmed this week to some extent by the barrage of news coming out of the Florida Supreme Court. Justices dealt with cases on gambling, the death penalty, medical malpractice and the open carrying of firearms.

The gambling case centers on a tiny horse track that is trying to convince the court that it should have slot machines, even without the express approval of the Legislature.

Lawyers for Gretna Racing in Gadsden County and the state traded at-times semantic arguments concerning a 2009 state law that the track said gave it permission to let voters decide whether slots should be allowed at the pari-mutuel.

Some justices seemed frustrated with the close parsing of the state law involved.

“We can get all wrapped up in all the words and phrases and need an English professor to tell us what these things mean,” Justice R. Fred Lewis said.

Almost as complex were the court’s deliberations over whether the state’s new death penalty law is constitutional and, if so, whether it applies to cases that were already in the pipeline when the law passed in March.

But the arguments Tuesday in the case of Larry Darnell Perry, who was convicted of the 2013 murder of his infant son, did little to clear up the murky situation surrounding a January ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, in a case known as Hurst v. Florida, or a new law approved in response.

“Clearly at this stage in our jurisprudence, we want to make sure that the statute is construed in a constitutional manner so that we don’t have another 15 years of death penalty — if the state wants the death penalty, which apparently it does — in flux,” Justice Barbara Pariente said.

Under Florida’s old law, jurors by a simple majority could recommend the death penalty. Judges would then make findings of fact that “sufficient” aggravating factors, not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, existed for the death sentence to be imposed.

That system was an unconstitutional violation of the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in an 8-1 ruling.

Florida’s new law requires juries to unanimously determine “the existence of at least one aggravating factor” before defendants can be eligible for death sentences. The law also requires at least 10 jurors to recommend the death penalty in order for the sentence to be imposed.

The gun case dealt with whether Floridians should be allowed to carry firearms openly, instead of being required to follow the state’s concealed-carry law. On medical malpractice, the issue was whether non-economic damages, commonly known as pain and suffering damages, should be capped.

Justices did rule on a case dealing with workers’ compensation insurance, issuing a 5-2 decision in favor of Bradley Westphal, a St. Petersburg firefighter who suffered a severe back injury while on the job in 2009. The case focused on a workers’ compensation law that led to Westphal’s benefits being cut off after two years, creating what the Supreme Court described as a “coverage gap.”

“As applied to Westphal, the current workers’ compensation statutory scheme does not just reduce the amount of benefits he would receive … but in fact completely cuts off his ability to receive any disability benefits at all,” said the majority opinion written by Pariente and joined fully by Chief Justice Jorge Labarga and Justices Peggy Quince and James E.C. Perry. Lewis wrote a separate concurring opinion.

The Florida Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America quickly issued statements warning that Thursday’s ruling could hurt businesses. Florida Chamber President and CEO Mark Wilson described it as a “further sign that Florida’s workers’ comp system is under attack.”

FAMU: ‘WORKING FOR THE STUDENTS’ OR ‘DYSFUNCTION’?

Also under siege was Mangum, whose week ended with the university president not knowing exactly how much longer she might have at the helm. The Florida A&M University Board of Trustees on Friday delayed a decision about whether to extend Mangum’s contract, now in its third and final year. The deal expires at the end of March.

The 13-member board has eight new members since a failed attempt to fire Mangum last fall. At that time, Kelvin Lawson — who was elected chairman of the board Friday — was the author of a motion to remove Mangum for “incurable cause.”

“I think some of us that have been around longer have a slightly better perspective,” he said Friday. “I think the other board members are going to have to go through that review and then probably get (last year’s evaluation) as a point of comparison to decide if anything at all needs to happen, or if the president’s just allowed to work out the balance of the term of the agreement.”

Mangum said she would not resign.

“The board can do whatever it wants to do,” she said. “I’m here to serve, working for the students, so the board can go line by line, they can extend, they can add, they can change, they can offer options.”

The day before the Friday meeting, a group of former FAMU presidents sent a letter to the board urging trustees not to renew her contract.

“Unfortunately, the disenfranchisement of students, faculty, alumni, staff and community seems to have thrown the university off course,” said the letter, signed by former presidents Frederick Humphries and Fred Gainous and former interim presidents Castell Bryant and Henry Lewis. “We agree that the stalemate that is currently in place creates a culture that will not allow for growth or stability. It is impossible for any university to thrive amid constant dysfunction.”

STORY OF THE WEEK: The South Florida legislative delegation underwent significant changes, with two longtime lawmakers stepping aside and two others deciding to swap their seats.

Trump referenced Bush having signed the Republican pledge to support the Republican nominee, but refusing to back Trump after being defeated. “You got to live up to your word,” Trump challenged.

“We’ve had one day and look at this, it’s amazing,” Trump said when he took the stage, referencing the rally having been scheduled just a few days earlier.

Throughout Trump’s speech, he criticized presumptive Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.

“If the system works, she’s really not allowed to run,” Trump said of Clinton because of her criminal investigation into the email scandal. “It’s really unfair to other people. It’s so unfair to other people who did 10 percent of what she did and they end up destroying their lives.”

He also said he’s been told that the first debate between Clinton and himself will be “the most watched debate in the history of television.”

“They say that the election between crooked Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in the history of elections in this country,” he added.

“If the system works, she’s really not allowed to run,” Trump said of Clinton because of her criminal investigation into the email scandal. “It’s really unfair to other people. It’s so unfair to other people who did 10 percent of what she did and they end up destroying their lives.”

He also said he’s been told that the first debate between Clinton and himself will be “the most watched debate in the history of television.”

“They say that the election between crooked Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in the history of elections in this country,” he added.

Fifty people have been killed, including the assailant, and at least 53 injured in an attack inside a gay nightclub in the US state of Florida, authorities said, in the worst mass shooting in US history.

Authorities identified the shooter on Sunday as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old man born in New York with Afghan origins.

Mateen, who was armed with an assault-type rifle and a handgun, was killed in a shootout with at least 11 police officers inside the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.

Ron Hopper, special FBI agent in charge of the Orlando office, confirmed that Mateen was interviewed twice by the agency in 2013, after he made “inflammatory comments” to co-workers alleging possible “terrorist ties”.

In 2014, authorities interrogated Mateen anew for possible ties to an American suicide bomber.

In both cases, the FBI closed the investigations as they turned out to be “inconclusive” at that time, Hopper said.

Hopper also confirmed media reports that Mateen made 911 calls to police early on Sunday, and referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL also known as ISIS) group.

In a televised statement, President Barack Obama condemned the shooting as “an act of terror and an act of hate”, calling the shooter “a person filled with hatred”.

“As Americans, we are united in grief and outrage,” he said, adding that the attack is “a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon” and commit violence in the US.

Orlando Police chief John Mina described the shooting as “one of the worst tragedies we have seen”, adding that police officers “were shaken by what they have seen inside the club”.

“It’s a tragedy not only for the city but the entire nation,” he said. “Just a look into the eyes of our officers told the whole story.”

The injured, many in critical condition, were transferred to nearby hospitals. Among those injured was one police officer, whose kevlar helmet was hit by a round from the suspect.

The suspect exchanged gunfire with a police officer working at the club, which had more than 300 people inside. The gunman then went back inside and took hostages, Mina said.

Around 5am, authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the hostages.

While details of the attack were still emerging, Orlando residents gathered outside the nightclub to pay their respects to the victims.

Al Jazeera’s Andy Gallacher, reporting from the scene, described a banner laid out in the streets where people dipped their hands in paint and made their mark. Across the top of the banner was written, “Today our hearts cry out in unity”.

“Just metres away at the Pulse nightclub, a popular venue for the LGBT community, bodies of the victims are still lying where they fell,” our correspondent said. “Many are yet to be identified.”

As the shooting occurred, the nightclub urged patrons to “get out” and “keep running” in a post on its Facebook page.

One witness, who said he was inside the building during the incident, said he heard about 40 shots being fired.

Christopher Hansen said he was in the VIP lounge of the club when he heard gunshots. He continued to hear shooting even after he emerged and police urged people to back away from the club. He saw the wounded being tended to across the street.

“I was thinking, ‘Are you kidding me?’ So I just dropped down. I just said, ‘Please, please, please, I want to make it out,'” he said. “And when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood. You hope and pray you don’t get shot.”",President Obama calls attack on gay nightclub in Orlando “an act of terror and an act of hate”.

But back then, during the Wild West days of the international political industry, there was more buzz in Washington and Manila about Manafort’s proximity to Marcos during a period of epic spending to support a lavish lifestyle and to curry favor with influential Americans. The lack of a transparent paper trail — combined with the larger than life personas of Marcos and Manafort — spawned a swirl of theories. One example, according to documents, including some published here for the first time: Marcos earmarked huge sums of cash for Reagan’s 1980 and 1984 campaigns — as much as $57 million, according to one claim made to Philippine investigators. There’s no evidence that any cash ever made it into Reagan’s coffers, which would have been illegal since U.S. election laws ban donations from foreigners. And, despite extensive government investigations on both sides of the Pacific into the freewheeling spending of the Marcos regime, there’s never before been much serious inquiry of what ultimately happened to the cash intended for political contributions. The lack of a transparent paper trail — combined with the larger than life personas of Marcos and Manafort — spawned a swirl of theories. In a phone interview this month, Manafort, now 67, acknowledged that for the better part of 30 years, he’s been dealing with speculation that he accepted millions of dollars in Marcos’s cash — either as a bonus or as a donation intended for Reagan. “It was circulating way back when, when people were out to just pass rumors and things about me. It’s old stuff that never had any legs anywhere,” said Manafort. “It’s totally fiction,” he said, asserting that every penny he received from Marcos’ allies was disclosed to the U.S. Justice Department in mandatory filings. “We’d have done everything by the book,” he said, attributing persistent claims to the contrary to rivals and former colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and suggesting that some are reviving the talk now for political purposes. After largely disappearing from the U.S. political spotlight for the past 20 years to build to a portfolio of foreign clients, Manafort reemerged in late March as a key adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. He was quickly promoted to chief strategist and chairman, and has been working to put his international affiliations behind him (when POLITICO asked him to describe his relationship with Marcos, he laughed and said, “I’ve got to go”).

It began vacuuming up clients attracted by its growing stable of well-connected Republican and Democratic lobbyists lured to the firm by gaudy salaries from prominent congressional or executive branch posts. The firm’s partners were boasting of $450,000 annual salaries (not including bonuses for bringing in new clients) by 1986, though Black at the time protested that those figures were exaggerated. Major contracts included Bethlehem Steel, the investment bank Salomon Brothers and the cigarette industry trade group The Tobacco Institute — not to mention Trump. The billionaire real estate developer paid the firm to fight the expansion of Indian casinos that could compete with his Atlantic City gambling business, and to change the flightpath of planes at West Palm Beach International Airport, which he said disturbed guests at his newly purchased Mar-a-Lago club. It was on the international stage, however, that the firm found some of its most lucrative work, landing contracts representing the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Portugal and an anticommunist rebel group in Angola, among others. In 1986, the two firms — Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, and Black, Manafort, Stone and Atwater — combined with Manafort personally to collect $2.4 million from international clients, according to filings with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly’s pitch to win the business from the ruling party of the Bahamas, which at the time was being accused of ties to drug trafficking, spelled out the approach of its principals. The firm’s relationships with State Department officials could be “utilized to upgrade a backchannel relationship in the economic and foreign policy spheres,” according to a portion of the pitch published by TIME magazine in 1986. One of the firm’s associates, Riva Levinson, who worked under Manafort on the Philippines account, recalled that he was not impressed when she informed him that she had to believe in what she was doing. Manafort predicted that “will be my downfall in this business,” she recalled in her memoir, published this month. She wrote that a running joke inside the firm was that its work was “like playing one big game of Stratego: building armies and scheming to take over the world. That is exactly what it feels like working with Manafort. In fact, at times, that is exactly what is going on.” Manafort himself said he had “no idea” when he first connected with Marcos, but emphasized that he followed all disclosure rules.

Peter Kelly, the Democratic partner in the firm, said Manafort was attracted to trappings of wealth and cultivated an aura of an international jet-setter. He would disappear for days or even weeks without telling people at the firm where he was going or what he was doing and would return to submit expenses including Concorde flights to Paris and bills for stays in a suite at the extravagant Hotel de Crillon, according to Kelly and other former employees at the firm. According to interviews and property records, Manafort drove a top-of-line Mercedes sedan and has purchased, built or rented pricey estates in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia; Palm Beach, Florida and the Hamptons, as well a horse farm in Virginia and a condo in Manhattan’s Trump Tower, where his new boss’ campaign headquarters are located. Several former colleagues and associates recall Manafort boasting about paying to relocate the swimming pool outside the home he built in Mount Vernon because he didn’t like the shade/sun balance, but a former Manafort neighbor told POLITICO it was because the pool was causing problems with the home’s foundation as it settled. Manafort has told associates that he’s not drawing a salary from Trump’s campaign, and there don’t appear to be any payments to him in the campaign’s Federal Election Commission filings, leading multiple operatives in and around Trump’s campaign to speculate that Manafort is positioning himself to receive a cut from ad buys, polling or other contract work. Manafort rejected that speculation. “No, no, no, no. I’m a volunteer. I’m at a point in my life where I can volunteer my time,” he told POLITICO. Kelly, in an interview, said Manafort’s driving motivation always seemed to be “to be in the middle of the action. He loved the action. I think that’s what gets him off more than anything. At a certain point, money becomes irrelevant.” Manafort brushed aside questions that he misled his partners, suggesting that politics was motivating the criticism from Kelly, who was a top adviser to Bill Clinton’s presidential campaigns. “Peter Kelly was the only Democrat in the firm at that time, so guess what? He has a vested interest in helping Hillary right now,” said Manafort. “That’s all. He’s playing a game.” But Kelly wasn’t the only former colleague who expressed misgivings about Manafort’s behavior to POLITICO. And Kelly said Manafort sometimes failed to alert the firm of what he was up to, accepting gigs with authoritarian regimes with which some other firm officials felt uncomfortable.

When Marcos arrived in Hawaii, U.S. customs officials seized thousands of pages of financial documents that detailed his stashing and spending of an enormous fortune plundered from the people of the Philippines. Among them: a one-page ledger obtained by POLITICO from a lawyer who sued the Marcos estate. The document, published here for the first time, appears to detail Marcos’ intended donations to U.S. political campaigns in 1980 and 1982, including $50,000 each to the competing 1980 campaigns of Reagan and the Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter. That cash, as well as $75,000 in donations slated for congressional and local candidates between 1979 and 1982, was to have come from a San Francisco-based company that was linked to a Philippine intelligence fund, the ledger suggests. POLITICO was unable to reach the Marcos associate who administered the company, an American citizen who donated tens of thousands of dollars to U.S. campaigns that he claimed came from his own funds. Another document — a letter from to Marcos from a senior aide that was obtained when his opponents ransacked his files — seems to refer to accounts set up for Reagan and his 1980 campaign manager, the late William J. Casey. The letter catalogues other documents, including “1980-SEC-014: Funds to Casey” and “1980-SEC-015: Reagan Funds Not Used,” according to a 1996 report by The Associated Press former investigative reporter Robert Parry. A third document — a whistle-blower letter from a group of anonymous bankers — alleged that the dictator planned to donate $7 million to Reagan’s 1980 campaign, $50 million to his 1984 reelection bid and $10 million to “various candidates” in the 1982 congressional midterm elections, according to contemporary media accounts. The letter was delivered to the Philippine commission that investigated Marcos’ plunder of public resources, the Presidential Commission on Good Government, by a former banker named Antonio Gatmaitan in the days after Marcos stepped down. In an interview, Gatmaitan stood by the claims in the letter, and questioned the degree to which they were investigated by the PCGG, which itself has been the target of corruption allegations, even as it’s recovered an estimated $3.6 billion in Marcos’ assets. “I don’t believe that they took it seriously, because Marcos was gone already by that time,” he said. “That’s typical here. Once the principals are gone, the stories die.” Richard Roger T. Amurao, the acting chairman of the PCGG, said he couldn’t find the letter from the anonymous bankers, nor any records suggesting that the commission investigated its charges or other evidence that Marcos intended to donate to U.S. campaigns.

Charlie Black, Manafort’s lobbying partner, said of the book: “I don’t know where Ed would have gotten that,” adding “I’m pretty confident Paul wasn’t involved in any of that. Paul is a lawyer, so he would have known it was illegal. Plus, he has more integrity than that.” And he said “$10 million was a lot of money in those days and if it had happened, I don’t think we would have seen hide nor hair of Paul again.” In fact, Black said he and Manafort discussed the book when it came out, since it seemed obvious to informed readers that Manafort was the undisclosed lobbyist. But Black said “Paul didn’t sound like he was losing any sleep over it.” As for Zamora, who returned to the Philippine congress after being term-limited out in 2010, he rejected Rollins’ account. “I certainly didn’t do anything like that,” he proclaimed, when reached by phone this month. He asserted he’d never met Manafort and added “I’m not even sure that I had that dinner” with Rollins. Zamora said he and Marcos “never even talked about donating to any presidential campaign.” Pointing out that Marcos also was a lawyer (he boasted of receiving a near-perfect score of 98.8 percent on his bar exam, though that was later disputed), Zamora said Marcos “was careful about complying with election laws, especially American election laws, because you are even more strict than we are.” Besides, Zamora added with bemusement, “How do you carry $10 million in cash? You know, not to sound too familiar with United States currency, but your currency is a little difficult to carry in cash.” Off the top of his head, he calculated that $10 million in $100 bills must weigh “a couple hundred pounds.” (The precise weight is 220 pounds, according to a U.S. Treasury estimate.) Zamora did acknowledge signing a contract with Manafort’s firm on behalf of The Chamber of Philippine Manufacturers, Exporters & Tourism Associations. But he said he only did so at the request of Marcos’s late brother-in-law Benjamin Trinidad Romualdez. “He was the one who asked me to sign for the group of the president,” said Zamora, professing ignorance to Black Manafort’s work or anything about the contract beyond the fact that he signed it.","As Ferdinand Marcos used his fortune to cling to power, he found an ally in Trump’s campaign chairman."

The slaying of Medgar Evers, 37, followed by only hours a plea by President Kennedy for a racial golden rule to put out ""fires of frustration and discord"" among Negroes.

Evers, dying from a rifle slug in the back, was found by police investigating a report of a shooting in the neat, middle class Negro neighborhood where he lived in the Mississippi capital.

The Negro leader died about a quarter hour after being taken to the University of Mississippi medical center.

Evers' neighbor, Houston Wells, said the state NAACP field secretary yelled ""Turn me loose"" before he became unconscious.

Evers' wife, Myrlie, and their three children, Darrell, 9, Denise, 8, and Vandike, 3, were inside the house. Mrs. Evers said she heard her husband drive up and then heard shots. The family rushed outside, she said, and the children ""talked to him and asked him several times to get up.""

Mrs. Evers, who was placed under sedation, said ""This will not stop anything. They will have to kill me and the children and an awful lot of others.""

Detective John Chamblee said a preliminary investigation indicated that Evers, whose house was hit with a Molotov cocktail last month, was shot from a vacant lot across the street.

Chamblee said the rifle slug passed through Evers' body and plowed through a picture window in the house. The spent slug, badly defaced, was found on a kitchen table.

Wells, 39, who lives next door, said he heard the shooting and grabbed a pistol and ran outside to find Evers was lying in Evers' driveway. Wells said he fired a shot to scare the sniper away and then called police before rushing Evers to the hospital.

Evers was carrying an armload of T-shirts bearing the letters NAACP when he was shot. The shirts were scattered in the driveway.

Mayor Allen Thompson interrupted a Florida vacation to return here. He ordered police to use all their facilities to track down the slayer. District Attorney General Robert Kennedy expressed shock and offered services of the FBI.

Cong. William M. Colmer, whose district includes Jackson, told the House that the slaying was a ""dastardly act."" He said it was an inevitable result of ""agitation by politicians, do-gooders and those who sail under the false flag of liberalism.""

The NAACP in New York immediately offered a $10,000 reward ""for information which results in the arrest of and conviction of any person or persons guilty of this crime.""

NAACP Executive Secretary Roy Wilkins said in New York, ""the entire nation has lost a man who believed in America and died defending its principle.""

Wilkins said the slaying of Evers ""demonstrates the blind and murderous hated"" which obsesses too many Mississippians.

Evers, dying from a rifle slug in the back, was found by police investigating a report of a shooting in the neat, middle class Negro neighborhood where he lived in the Mississippi capital.

The Negro leader died about a quarter hour after being taken to the University of Mississippi medical center.

Evers' neighbor, Houston Wells, said the state NAACP field secretary yelled ""Turn me loose"" before he became unconscious.

Evers' wife, Myrlie, and their three children, Darrell, 9, Denise, 8, and Vandike, 3, were inside the house. Mrs. Evers said she heard her husband drive up and then heard shots. The family rushed outside, she said, and the children ""talked to him and asked him several times to get up.""

Mrs. Evers, who was placed under sedation, said ""This will not stop anything. They will have to kill me and the children and an awful lot of others.""

Detective John Chamblee said a preliminary investigation indicated that Evers, whose house was hit with a Molotov cocktail last month, was shot from a vacant lot across the street.

Chamblee said the rifle slug passed through Evers' body and plowed through a picture window in the house. The spent slug, badly defaced, was found on a kitchen table.

Wells, 39, who lives next door, said he heard the shooting and grabbed a pistol and ran outside to find Evers was lying in Evers' driveway. Wells said he fired a shot to scare the sniper away and then called police before rushing Evers to the hospital.

Evers was carrying an armload of T-shirts bearing the letters NAACP when he was shot. The shirts were scattered in the driveway.

Mayor Allen Thompson interrupted a Florida vacation to return here. He ordered police to use all their facilities to track down the slayer. District Attorney General Robert Kennedy expressed shock and offered services of the FBI.

An ""organised and well prepared"" shooter armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, and possibly wearing a bomb, shot at the hundreds of people at the nightclub and police, before taking hostages.

Police are still combing the nearby area for possible explosive devices.

The shooter's motive is not known.

Chief of Police John Mina told reporters that a police officer working at Pulse nightclub responded to shots fired at around 2am and engaged in a gun battle. The suspect returned into the club where he fired more shots and took hostages.

Around 320 people were in the nightclub on Saturday night.

At 5am, after being contacted by patrons in the club's bathroom and other areas, police decided to rescue hostages inside. A SWAT team stormed in, and the shooter was killed in the gun battle that followed.

30 people trapped inside the club were rescued alive. Altogether, at least 42 people have been hospitalised.

One officer sustained an injury to his eye, and police believe his Kevlar helmet saved his life.

The FBI has indicated that it will pursue a ""slow and methodical"" investigation, and is calling for any information from the public that may assist.

Early reports of shots fired outside a nearby hospital and of a second shooter were not accurate, Chief Mina said.",

Police, firefighters and paramedics were called to Pulse at around 2am local time after reports of multiple casualties.

This afternoon they identified the gunman as US citizen Omar Mateen. He was of Afghan descent and from Port St Lucie, Florida.

CBS News reported that Mateen – who died in a shootout with police after the hostage siege – has no apparent criminal history and that authorities are investigating whether he had ties to Islamic extremism.Police speculated that in the region of 20 people inside the club had been murdered and at least 43 people were rushed to hospital to be treated for gunshot wounds.

The mayor of Orlando said ‘many lives’ had been lost as a result of the shooting.

The FBI is treating the incident as an act of terrorism and there were indications that it could have been related to radical Islamism or a hate crime.

Police said the gunman was well-prepared, but not from the local area.

Police said the gunman started a shootout at 2am with a police officer who was on duty at the club before fleeing inside the club where he took hostages.

At 5am the suspect was killed and he was found to have a suspicious device on him along with an assault rifle and a handgun.

An explosion was heard, sparking some scenes of panic. However this was a controlled explosion.

Three hours after the incident started officers were ordered to find cover after more shots were fired at the scene.

One officer was shot and injured in the eye but his Kevlar helmet saved his life.

There were approximately 320 people in the club at the time of the shooting and some people tweeted from inside begging for help.

Victims had to be rushed to hospitals in pickup trucks and police vehicles as paramedics became thinly stretched.

The club posted on Facebook telling people to get out and keep running earlier this morning.

Ricardo J. Negron Almodovar wrote on Facebook: ‘I was there. Shooter opened fire @ around 2:00am.

‘People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran. I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well :(‘

A police dispatcher said: ‘There are injuries. I am not sure if there are any deceased at this time.

‘Officers are going in to search the building and to get people out.

Currently 40 people are believed to have been injured, but according to a paramedic that number is rising as more people are brought out of the club.

Police posted on Twitter to say that multiple injuries had been reported and urged people to ‘stay away from area’.

Gunshots can be heard in this video from outside the club

It was later reported locally that the gunman had moved on to Orlando Regional Medical Centre. Shots were allegedly heard in and around the hospital and no new patients were being admitted. However, the lockdown was later removed and trauma patients were being admitted.

Paramedic Jordan Hubler said: ‘There was a shooter with an assault rifle who shot up the people in the club sometime around 2am. The club is reported to have been at full capacity. The shooter has himself barricaded inside Pulse with multiple hostages.’",At least 43 people have been transferred to hospital including a police officer.

These garments, once primarily worn for cultural and ceremonial purposes, are now being embraced by the fashion world in China and abroad. The fusion of timeless tradition with modern design has sparked a renewed interest in these garments, making them popular for high-end fashion shows and street style.

Chinese dresses, such as the qipao, have been symbols of elegance and grace for centuries. Originating from the Qing Dynasty, the qipao is characterized by its close-fitting silhouette, high collar, and intricate patterns. Similarly, the hanfu, the traditional clothing worn by Han Chinese people, has seen a resurgence due to a growing interest in Chinese cultural heritage. These dresses, once relegated to cultural celebrations or historical reenactments, are now being reinterpreted by contemporary designers and embraced by young fashion enthusiasts. Robes Chinoises’ website (https://robeschinoises.fr) offers a collection of modernized traditional Chinese dresses, capturing the essence of these garments while giving them a fresh twist.

Fashion trends are often cyclical, and the rise of traditional Chinese dresses is a perfect example of this. Designers are taking cues from classic Chinese aesthetics, blending them with modern styles to create a nostalgic and fresh look. The result is a marriage of heritage and innovation, where traditional elements such as silk fabric, floral embroidery, and Mandarin collars are combined with contemporary cuts, colours, and fabrics.

The qipao, for example, has evolved significantly since its inception. Once a garment worn solely by women in the elite classes, it is now a symbol of sophistication and is frequently worn at events ranging from weddings to gala dinners. Modern versions of the qipao feature updated designs, such as asymmetrical hems, shorter sleeves, and bold prints, making it suitable for various occasions. The hanfu, on the other hand, is experiencing a revival in everyday wear. While it was once reserved for special ceremonies, young people in China are now seen sporting hanfu in public spaces, combining traditional styles with modern accessories for a stylish, unique look.

The revival of Chinese dresses is not limited to China. Western designers and fashion houses have also drawn inspiration from Chinese garments, incorporating elements of the qipao and hanfu into their collections. High fashion runways have showcased Chinese-inspired dresses, with designers paying homage to Chinese culture while adapting the designs for a global audience. This cross-cultural exchange has allowed the traditional Chinese dress to gain international recognition, breaking barriers and becoming a symbol of cultural appreciation.

In addition to haute couture, Chinese dresses are making their way into everyday fashion. Global fashion influencers and celebrities are often seen wearing modernized versions of the qipao or hanfu, further fueling the trend. On social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, the hashtag #ChineseFashion has garnered millions of views, showcasing how these dresses are being reimagined and worn by people worldwide. This level of visibility has helped normalize the wearing of Chinese dresses in everyday settings, making them accessible and appealing to a wider audience.

While the resurgence of Chinese dresses in modern fashion is generally seen as a positive development, it has sparked conversations about cultural appropriation. Some critics argue that wearing traditional Chinese garments without understanding their cultural significance can lead to the misrepresentation of Chinese heritage. However, many fashion designers and consumers are trying to approach these garments respectfully, often learning about their history and meaning before incorporating them into their wardrobes.

The key to embracing Chinese dresses in modern fashion lies in understanding their cultural importance. For many, these garments are not just clothes—they symbolize Chinese history, art, and identity. When worn with respect and knowledge, traditional Chinese dresses can serve as a bridge between cultures, fostering appreciation for the rich history they represent.

Looking ahead, it seems that the revival of Chinese dresses in fashion is not just a passing trend. As fashion embraces diversity and cultural expression, traditional Chinese dresses will likely remain influential in the global fashion landscape. Whether through the luxurious silk of a qipao or the flowing elegance of a hanfu, these garments are reclaiming their place in modern wardrobes.

Young Chinese designers are also playing a crucial role in this revival. Many incorporate traditional elements into their collections, ensuring that Chinese fashion continues evolving while honouring its roots. With the support of local and international fashion communities, the future of Chinese dresses looks bright, with endless possibilities for reinvention and innovation.

The resurgence of Chinese dresses represents more than just a revival of fashion; it is a celebration of culture, history, and the global exchange of ideas. As the world becomes more interconnected, the traditional Chinese dress is set to remain a timeless symbol of elegance and cultural pride, appreciated by people across the globe.",

These garments, once primarily worn for cultural and ceremonial purposes, are now being embraced by the fashion world in China and abroad. The fusion of timeless tradition with modern design has sparked a renewed interest in these garments, making them popular for high-end fashion shows and street style.

Chinese dresses, such as the qipao, have been symbols of elegance and grace for centuries. Originating from the Qing Dynasty, the qipao is characterized by its close-fitting silhouette, high collar, and intricate patterns. Similarly, the hanfu, the traditional clothing worn by Han Chinese people, has seen a resurgence due to a growing interest in Chinese cultural heritage. These dresses, once relegated to cultural celebrations or historical reenactments, are now being reinterpreted by contemporary designers and embraced by young fashion enthusiasts. Robes Chinoises’ website (https://robeschinoises.fr) offers a collection of modernized traditional Chinese dresses, capturing the essence of these garments while giving them a fresh twist.

Fashion trends are often cyclical, and the rise of traditional Chinese dresses is a perfect example of this. Designers are taking cues from classic Chinese aesthetics, blending them with modern styles to create a nostalgic and fresh look. The result is a marriage of heritage and innovation, where traditional elements such as silk fabric, floral embroidery, and Mandarin collars are combined with contemporary cuts, colours, and fabrics.

The qipao, for example, has evolved significantly since its inception. Once a garment worn solely by women in the elite classes, it is now a symbol of sophistication and is frequently worn at events ranging from weddings to gala dinners. Modern versions of the qipao feature updated designs, such as asymmetrical hems, shorter sleeves, and bold prints, making it suitable for various occasions. The hanfu, on the other hand, is experiencing a revival in everyday wear. While it was once reserved for special ceremonies, young people in China are now seen sporting hanfu in public spaces, combining traditional styles with modern accessories for a stylish, unique look.

—Orlando’s mayor says Omar Mateen threatened to strap explosives onto his hostages at the Pulse nightclub. He also said the attacker drove around several locations in the city before killing 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub.

—News reports say Mateen’s wife might have been aware of the plot to attack Pulse. She told federal agents she tried to talk him out of Sunday’s attack. The U.S. attorney declined to say if anyone would be charged in the attack.

—President Obama said at present investigators “do not have any information to indicate that a foreign terrorist group directed the attack in Orlando.” But, he added, it’s clear Mateen was radicalized over the Internet.

—Follow the developing story below. All updates are in Eastern Standard Time.

The FBI sought the public’s help Wednesday to construct what led Omar Mateen to select the Pulse nightclub as the target of his attack on Sunday.

‘‘We need your help in developing the most complete picture of what he did and why he did it,’’ FBI agent Ron Hopper said at a news conference.

Lee Bentley, the U.S. attorney, declined to comment on whether charges would be brought against anyone in the case, merely saying investigators were talking to several other people in connection with the attack that killed 49 people. On Tuesday, news reports said Mateen’s wife, Noor Zahi Salman, helped him scout the Pulse nightclub.

Buddy Dyer, the Orlando mayor, said Mateen drove around several locations in the Orlando area Saturday evening, before he picked Pulse.

“What I know concretely is that he was driving around that evening and visited several locations,” Dyer said. He did not elaborate.

And, Dyer said, Mateen had threatened to strap explosives onto the hostages, hastening the decision to send a SWAT team to the location to end the standoff.

What did Omar Mateen’s wife know?

NBC and others are reporting Omar Mateen’s wife, Noor Zahi Salman, might have been aware of the plot to attack Pulse. She told federal agents she tried to talk him out of Sunday’s attack, NBC reported.

News reports say she is cooperating with investigators.

The president, speaking at the White House, reiterated some of what we already know about Omar Mateen.

“We currently do not have any information to indicate that a foreign terrorist group directed the attack in Orlando,” he said. “It is increasingly clear, however, that the killer took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet. He appears to have been an angry, disturbed, unstable young man who became radicalized.”

Obama said lone-wolf actors like Mateen are hard to detect, but “we are doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks.

“We work to succeed 100 percent of the time,” Obama said. “The attacker, as we saw in Orlando, only has to succeed once.”

Obama also took the opportunity to rail against the proposal by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the U.S.

“The Orlando killer, one of the San Bernardino killers, the Fort Hood killer, they were all U.S. citizens,” Obama said. “Are we going to start treating all Muslim Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith? We’ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do republican officials actually agree with this? Because that’s not the america we want.”

We’ll have a story on Obama’s full remarks presently, and will provide a link to it here.

Here are some of the headlines we’re seeing this morning on the attack in Orlando:

Witness: Omar Mateen drank alone at Pulse before attack (The Orlando Sentinel)

What ISIS Wants (The Atlantic)

Meanwhile, the city Orlando has identified all 49 victims of the shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the city.

French and American media are drawing comparisons between the shooting at the nightclub and the terrorist attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris last year, in which 89 people were killed. Like in Paris, the victims of the Orlando massacre were mostly young people in their twenties and thirties, enjoying a night out. Like at the Bataclan, witnesses of the Orlando rampage initially thought the sounds of gunshots were part of the club’s music.

“At first it sounded like it was part of the show, because there was an event going on —we were all just having a good time,” Andy Moss, who was inside the club, told CNN. “But once people started screaming and shots just kept ringing out, you know that it’s not a show any more, and you gotta do what you’ve gotta do ... My first instinct was to run and get out.”

CNN also reported first responders heard the ringing of cellphones when they entered the nightclub after the shooting, the sounds of the relatives and friends of the victims trying to reach them. “That was, of course, the same at Bataclan,” French journalist Anne-Elisabeth Moutet told the BBC. “That was one of the shocks that police came across.”

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee in a speech that’s still going on said: “The only reason the killer was in America in the first place is because we allowed his family to come here.”

Trump used the occasion to criticize Hillary Clinton, his likely Democratic rival in November, as well as President Obama. He called Clinton’s immigration policy “radical” and said he wants one that “promotes American values.”

Earlier this morning, Trump appeared to suggest that Obama was somehow involved in the shooting. “He doesn’t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands—it’s one or the other and either one is unacceptable,” he said.

My colleague David Graham is watching Trump’s remarks and we’ll update this with more from Trump’s speech.

The bodies of the victims were removed from the Pulse nightclub late Sunday night, and authorities spent Monday identifying the dead and notifying their families. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi told CNN Monday afternoon that interpreters have been brought in to speak to relatives because many speak only Spanish.

The city of Orlando has created a page on its website with a list of the victims’ names and their ages. So far, 46 of the 49 victims have been identified. The majority of the victims are men in their twenties and thirties. The youngest was 19, the oldest was 50. Here is the full list:

Interviews with relatives and friends have provided a glimpse into the lives of some of the victims. WFTV, the ABC affiliate in Orlando, spoke to Robert Guerrero, the cousin of Juan Ramon Guerrero, one of the victims. Robert Guerrero said his cousin came out as gay earlier this year. More from WFTV:

The Tampa Bay Times spoke to Rosalia Ramos, the mother of Stanley Almodovar. Ramos had made her son tomato-and-cheese dip to eat after he returned from Pulse. More:

Seddique Mateen Mir, speaking to reporters at his home in Port St. Lucie, Florida, earlier Monday:

Here are more of his remarks, via The New York Times: “The United States is my home and it has always taken care of me and my family. wish I knew what he was doing. I would have arrested him myself.”

The City of Orlando has named all but four of the victims in Sunday’s attack. Full list here.

Hillary Clinton gives her first speech since the shooting

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee described the Orlando shooter as a “lone wolf.” The threat of ISIS is “metastasizing,” Clinton said. “We saw this in Paris and we saw it in Brussels. We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves, radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.”

Clinton began her remarks by saying “today is not a day for politics,” but minutes later she began to list several prescriptions for combating ISIS abroad and gun violence on U.S. soil. Here’s an excerpt:

Clinton was referring to the fact that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was placed on an FBI terrorism watch list in 2013 and 2014 when the agency investigated him for potential ties to terrorism. Mateen was not on a watch list at the time of the shooting. The guns Mateen used in the shooting were purchased legally.

FBI Director James Comey in a news conference detailed what investigators have learned about Mateen. “There are strong indications of radicalization by this killer and a potential of inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations,” Comey said.

Comey purposely did not use Mateen’s name throughout his remarks, saying “part of what motivates sick people to do this kind of thing is some twisted notion of fame or glory, and I don’t want to be part of that for the sake of the victims and their families, and so that other twisted minds don’t think that this is a path to fame and recognition.”

He said investigators are examining Mateen’s electronic devices. He said there is no indication so far that Mateen received instruction from abroad or was part of a terrorist network. Mateen was “radicalized, and at least, in some part, through the internet.” Investigators are “working to understand what role anti-gay bigotry played in motivating this attack,” he said.

“We are looking for needles in a nationwide haystack,” Comey said. “But were also called upon to figure out which pieces of hay that someday become needles.”

Comey said Mateen first came to the attention of FBI in May 2013, when he worked as a security guard at a local courthouse. Mateen had told his coworkers he was a member of terrorist group Hezbollah, his family had ties to al-Qaeda, and he told coworkers that “he hoped law enforcement would raid his apartment and assault his wife and child so he could martyr himself.” The FBI spent 10 months investigating him, which including interviewing him twice, following him, recording his conversations with informants, and surveilling his communications. Mateen said he made those remarks because he felt his coworkers were discriminating against him for being Muslim, and the investigation was dropped.

The FBI looked into him again in July of 2014, when they learned Mateen and the American suicide bomber who died in Syria attended the same mosque in Florida.

Comey also gave more details of the phone calls the shooter made to 911 dispatchers during Sunday’s attack. Mateen dialed 911 twice. The dispatcher called him back after that, and then Mateen pledged loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, and expressed solidarity with the bombers of the 2013 Boston Marathon and an American citizen who carried out a suicide bombing in Syria in 2014.

President Obama says it appears Omar Mateen was radicalized by extremist propaganda disseminated on the Internet. Here’s an excerpt from his remarks at the White House made after he received a security briefing:

The president’s remarks also touched on gun control, the Islamic State, and violence against the LGBT community.

Omar Mateen’s former wife, Sitora Yusufiy, is speaking to reporters about the Orlando gunman, recalling his “instability” and his violence toward her.

Here’s what she said about Mateen, via USA Today:

Yusufiy’s family extricated her from her marriage when Mateen became violent toward her, she said, and they no longer were in contact.

The Orlando Police Department has revised the death toll in Sunday’s shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the city, to 49. The 50th body belonged to the shooter, Omar Mateen, the department said.

Forty-eight of the 49 victims have been identified, the department said, and the next of kin of 24 of the victims have been notified. At a news conference Monday, which was tweeted by the department, Chief John Mina described what happened at Pulse early Sunday morning:

Good morning. New details are emerging about Omar Mateen, the man who killed 50 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.

Here’s how The New York Times begins its story:

We are also learning the names of more of the victims at the popular gay nightclub. The City of Orlando says it will update the list as the families of the victims are notified.

Meanwhile, the Islamic State radio called Mateen “one of the soldiers of the caliphate in America.” What that means isn’t exactly clear: We don’t know if Mateen was affiliated with the group or inspired by it.

We're signing off for the night. Coverage will resume at 6 a.m. Monday morning.

Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks says earlier reports that a man arrested earlier today in Los Angeles intended to harm the L.A. Pride Festival were inaccurate.

The Los Angeles Times has more:

Host James Corden opened tonight’s Tony Awards in New York City on a somber note by paying tribute to the Orlando shooting victims.

The New York Daily News reported that the cast of ""Hamilton,"" a popular Revolutionary War musical, won't use muskets in their performance during tonight's ceremonies out of respect for the victims.

Donald Trump's condolence message also took aim at his likely Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. In a statement, the Clinton campaign fired back against him and his comments on the shooting.

In New York City, two towers will make two different tributes tonight.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday afternoon that One World Trade Center will “be lit [in] the colors of the pride flag in a tribute to LGBT Americans and the lives that were lost.”

At the same time, the Empire State Building announced its upper floors will not be lit at all in memory of the deceased.

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump offering his condolences. He also said President Obama “should step down” and his likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton “should get out of this race for the Presidency” for not calling the attacks “radical Islamic terrorism.”

Trump added that he planned to make a “major speech” on foreign policy on Monday. He did not acknowledge that the victims were members of the LGBT community.

In a subsequent tweet, Trump also seemed to reference his proposed ban on Muslim immigration, which he first suggested last December after the San Bernardino shootings.

In May, Trump said the ban was “just a suggestion.” Mateen was born in New York.

Democratic presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both offered their condolences to the victims in Orlando. Clinton’s statement focused on terrorism, the LGBT community, and gun control:

Sanders’ statement touched on the same themes. He issued it before President Obama and the FBI said they believed the shooting was an act of terror:

The city of Orlando is posting the names of victims whose families have been notified on the city website. Only four names have been released so far.

FBI Special Agent Ronald Hopper definitively identified the gunman as 29-year-old Omar Mateen at an afternoon press conference. He said Mateen died in an exchange of gunfire at the Pulse nightclub. Mateen, who was born in New York, was an American citizen of whom the bureau had been aware since 2013, Hopper said. He’d been investigated and questioned in 2013 and 2014, but the FBI didn’t find enough to merit a continued investigation of Mateen, Hopper said.

Hopper said Mateen had made 911 calls before his death. He declined to elaborate on the content of those calls, but said they had “become federal evidence [and] ...it was general to the Islamic State.” News reports had previously said Mateen had in the 911 calls pledged allegiance to ISIS, as the group is also known.

Trevor Velinor, an assistant special agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, said Mateen had legally purchased both of the weapons used in the attack in the past few days.

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, via its Amaq news agency.

To put this in context, we’ll turn to Rukmini Callimachi, The New York Times reporter, who has been tweeting about the attacks:

The U.K. royal family says it is shocked by the killings. Here’s a tweet from its official account:

CNN and others are reporting that Omar Mateen, the man named by several news organizations and a U.S. congressman as being responsible for the shooting, worked as a security guard for G4S Secure Solutions. Here’s a statement from the firm, via CNN:

“Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history,” President Obama said as he addressed the nation from the White House. He stressed the FBI’s investigation was just beginning and he offered no details on the attacker’s motives or associations. “Although it is early in the investigation, we know enough to say this is an act of terror and an act of hate,” he said.

While paying tribute to the victims, the president also noted the singular role of gay bars and nightclubs in the LGBT community, describing them as “a place of solidarity and empowerment, where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.”

While Obama did address gun violence in general, he spoke with a sense of resignation about the intractable debate over gun control. “This massacre is … a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that let's them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub,” he said. “And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to tactically do nothing is a decision as well.”

“In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,” Obama said. “We will not give in to fear and turn against each other.”

Pope Francis condemned “this new manifestation of homicidal folly and senseless hatred” in a statement about the Orlando shootings, Vatican Radio said.

“Pope Francis joins the families of the victims and all of the injured in prayer and in compassion,” the Vatican’s statement said. “Sharing in their indescribable suffering he entrusts them to the Lord so they may find comfort.”

The Los Angeles Times is reporting a man with guns and possible explosives was arrested in Santa Monica on Sunday. He reportedly told police he was going to the city’s gay-pride rally. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is scheduled to take part in the celebrations in LA. Several cities around the U.S., including Boston and Washington, D.C., held gay-pride celebrations this weekend. Here’s a complete list.

Sunday’s shooting comes during LGBT Pride Month, and law-enforcement agencies in major U.S. cities are stepping up their presence at LGBT sites and events. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said D.C. police will bolster their presence this weekend at Capitol Pride, the region’s annual LGBT-pride event, during Sunday’s festival.

In New York City, the NYPD said it placed its patrol and counter-terrorism units on alert. A New York Daily News reporter tweeted that armed NYPD officers have been placed outside the historic Stonewall Inn.

Florida Governor Rick Scott has declared a state of emergency in Orange County, freeing up more state law-enforcement resources to assist in Orlando.

Addressing reporters in Orlando, Scott said the state “would provide all the resources anyone needs” in response to the shooting.

President Obama will make a statement about the Orlando shooting at 1:30 p.m. ET, the White House says. Vice President Joe Biden has also canceled his planned appearance at a campaign fundraiser in Florida tonight.

OneBlood, a blood-donation organization in Orlando, is asking for donations on its Twitter feed:

But gay men, under current FDA rules, will be unable to donate blood to those in need after the attack.

Mayor Buddy Dyer said 50 people have been killed and 53 others taken to local hospitals.

“There’s blood everywhere,” he said at a news conference, adding the shooter used an assault rifle during the attack. He said he had asked the governor to declare a state of emergency.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said a handgun and an AR-15-type assault rifle was recovered from the scene. He said an unknown number of rounds were fired.

FBI said the investigation was in its early stages, and the bureau was investigating all angles, including whether it was a hate crime and if it was terrorism.

Imam Muhammad Musri, president of American Islam and the Islamic Society of Central Florida, urged the media not to rush to judgment. “It’s our worst nightmare, and we are sorry to know it happened to us,” he said.

Congressman Alan Grayson, Democrat of Florida, at a news conference identified the shooter as Omar Mateen. He said Mateen was in his late 20s. He said the gunman was a U.S. citizen, but that is “not true of some of his family members.” Grayson’s congressional district includes part of Orlando.

USA Today has more on Pulse, the club where the attack took place, and which labels itself as “not just another gay club.” An excerpt:

Multiple news organizations, including CBS News and NBC, citing anonymous law-enforcement sources, have identified the suspect as Omar Mateen, 27, of Port St. Lucie, Florida. We have not independently confirmed their reporting.

The presumptive Republican and Democratic presidential nominees shared their thoughts:

The White House says President Obama has been briefed on the attack.

Multiple people have been killed and at least 42 people are being treated at local hospitals after a gunman opened fire and took hostages at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday, police said. The gunman is dead.

At a news conference Sunday, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said “multiple people are dead inside” the Pulse nightclub in downtown Orlando, but he declined to provide an exact number, saying the number was about 20. Forty-two people have been transported to local hospitals, he said. Mayor Buddy Dyer called it a “crime that will have a lasting effect on our community.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, at the same news conference, called it a “domestic terror incident,” and an FBI official said there are “suggestions that the individual may have leanings towards (Islamist) ideology,” but he added the bureau was pursing other angles as well.

The shooter was found dead inside the club, Mina said. One officer was lightly injured, he said.

The shooter had an assault-type rifle, a handgun, and some type of device on him, he said. Officials at the news conference described the gunman as well-prepared and well-organized. He was not from the area, they said.

Pulse is a popular nightspot that hosts what it calls “Upscale Latin Saturdays” with three DJs and a show a midnight. On its Facebook page, the club warned customers to “get out of pulse and keep running.” A subsequent message said:

The shooting comes a little more than a day after a gunman shot and killed Christina Grimmie, the singer, at a concert venue in the city. Officials at the news conference said the two incidents were not connected.","The FBI is seeking the public’s help to piece together why Omar Mateen selected the Pulse nightclub as his target.

—Orlando’s mayor says Omar Mateen threatened to strap explosives onto his hostages at the Pulse nightclub. He also said the attacker drove around several locations in the city before killing 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub.

—News reports say Mateen’s wife might have been aware of the plot to attack Pulse. She told federal agents she tried to talk him out of Sunday’s attack. The U.S. attorney declined to say if anyone would be charged in the attack.

—President Obama said at present investigators “do not have any information to indicate that a foreign terrorist group directed the attack in Orlando.” But, he added, it’s clear Mateen was radicalized over the Internet.

—Follow the developing story below. All updates are in Eastern Standard Time.

The FBI sought the public’s help Wednesday to construct what led Omar Mateen to select the Pulse nightclub as the target of his attack on Sunday.

‘‘We need your help in developing the most complete picture of what he did and why he did it,’’ FBI agent Ron Hopper said at a news conference.

Lee Bentley, the U.S. attorney, declined to comment on whether charges would be brought against anyone in the case, merely saying investigators were talking to several other people in connection with the attack that killed 49 people. On Tuesday, news reports said Mateen’s wife, Noor Zahi Salman, helped him scout the Pulse nightclub.

Buddy Dyer, the Orlando mayor, said Mateen drove around several locations in the Orlando area Saturday evening, before he picked Pulse.

“What I know concretely is that he was driving around that evening and visited several locations,” Dyer said. He did not elaborate.

And, Dyer said, Mateen had threatened to strap explosives onto the hostages, hastening the decision to send a SWAT team to the location to end the standoff.

What did Omar Mateen’s wife know?

NBC and others are reporting Omar Mateen’s wife, Noor Zahi Salman, might have been aware of the plot to attack Pulse. She told federal agents she tried to talk him out of Sunday’s attack, NBC reported.

News reports say she is cooperating with investigators.

The president, speaking at the White House, reiterated some of what we already know about Omar Mateen.

“We currently do not have any information to indicate that a foreign terrorist group directed the attack in Orlando,” he said. “It is increasingly clear, however, that the killer took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet. He appears to have been an angry, disturbed, unstable young man who became radicalized.”

Obama said lone-wolf actors like Mateen are hard to detect, but “we are doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks.

“We work to succeed 100 percent of the time,” Obama said. “The attacker, as we saw in Orlando, only has to succeed once.”

Obama also took the opportunity to rail against the proposal by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the U.S.

“The Orlando killer, one of the San Bernardino killers, the Fort Hood killer, they were all U.S. citizens,” Obama said. “Are we going to start treating all Muslim Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith? We’ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do republican officials actually agree with this? Because that’s not the america we want.”

We’ll have a story on Obama’s full remarks presently, and will provide a link to it here.

Here are some of the headlines we’re seeing this morning on the attack in Orlando:

Omar Mateen, an ‘Americanized Guy,’ Shows Threat of Lone Terrorists (The New York Times)

Witness: Omar Mateen drank alone at Pulse before attack (The Orlando Sentinel)

What ISIS Wants (The Atlantic)

Meanwhile, the city Orlando has identified all 49 victims of the shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the city.

French and American media are drawing comparisons between the shooting at the nightclub and the terrorist attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris last year, in which 89 people were killed. Like in Paris, the victims of the Orlando massacre were mostly young people in their twenties and thirties, enjoying a night out. Like at the Bataclan, witnesses of the Orlando rampage initially thought the sounds of gunshots were part of the club’s music.

“At first it sounded like it was part of the show, because there was an event going on —we were all just having a good time,” Andy Moss, who was inside the club, told CNN. “But once people started screaming and shots just kept ringing out, you know that it’s not a show any more, and you gotta do what you’ve gotta do ... My first instinct was to run and get out.”

CNN also reported first responders heard the ringing of cellphones when they entered the nightclub after the shooting, the sounds of the relatives and friends of the victims trying to reach them. “That was, of course, the same at Bataclan,” French journalist Anne-Elisabeth Moutet told the BBC. “That was one of the shocks that police came across.”

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee in a speech that’s still going on said: “The only reason the killer was in America in the first place is because we allowed his family to come here.”

Trump used the occasion to criticize Hillary Clinton, his likely Democratic rival in November, as well as President Obama. He called Clinton’s immigration policy “radical” and said he wants one that “promotes American values.”

Earlier this morning, Trump appeared to suggest that Obama was somehow involved in the shooting. “He doesn’t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands—it’s one or the other and either one is unacceptable,” he said.

My colleague David Graham is watching Trump’s remarks and we’ll update this with more from Trump’s speech.

The bodies of the victims were removed from the Pulse nightclub late Sunday night, and authorities spent Monday identifying the dead and notifying their families. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi told CNN Monday afternoon that interpreters have been brought in to speak to relatives because many speak only Spanish.

The city of Orlando has created a page on its website with a list of the victims’ names and their ages. So far, 46 of the 49 victims have been identified. The majority of the victims are men in their twenties and thirties. The youngest was 19, the oldest was 50. Here is the full list:

Interviews with relatives and friends have provided a glimpse into the lives of some of the victims. WFTV, the ABC affiliate in Orlando, spoke to Robert Guerrero, the cousin of Juan Ramon Guerrero, one of the victims. Robert Guerrero said his cousin came out as gay earlier this year. More from WFTV:

The Tampa Bay Times spoke to Rosalia Ramos, the mother of Stanley Almodovar. Ramos had made her son tomato-and-cheese dip to eat after he returned from Pulse. More:

Seddique Mateen Mir, speaking to reporters at his home in Port St. Lucie, Florida, earlier Monday:

Here are more of his remarks, via The New York Times: “The United States is my home and it has always taken care of me and my family. wish I knew what he was doing. I would have arrested him myself.”

The City of Orlando has named all but four of the victims in Sunday’s attack. Full list here.

Hillary Clinton gives her first speech since the shooting

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee described the Orlando shooter as a “lone wolf.” The threat of ISIS is “metastasizing,” Clinton said. “We saw this in Paris and we saw it in Brussels. We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves, radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.”

Clinton began her remarks by saying “today is not a day for politics,” but minutes later she began to list several prescriptions for combating ISIS abroad and gun violence on U.S. soil. Here’s an excerpt:

Clinton was referring to the fact that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was placed on an FBI terrorism watch list in 2013 and 2014 when the agency investigated him for potential ties to terrorism. Mateen was not on a watch list at the time of the shooting. The guns Mateen used in the shooting were purchased legally.

FBI Director James Comey in a news conference detailed what investigators have learned about Mateen. “There are strong indications of radicalization by this killer and a potential of inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations,” Comey said.

Comey purposely did not use Mateen’s name throughout his remarks, saying “part of what motivates sick people to do this kind of thing is some twisted notion of fame or glory, and I don’t want to be part of that for the sake of the victims and their families, and so that other twisted minds don’t think that this is a path to fame and recognition.”

He said investigators are examining Mateen’s electronic devices. He said there is no indication so far that Mateen received instruction from abroad or was part of a terrorist network. Mateen was “radicalized, and at least, in some part, through the internet.” Investigators are “working to understand what role anti-gay bigotry played in motivating this attack,” he said.

“We are looking for needles in a nationwide haystack,” Comey said. “But were also called upon to figure out which pieces of hay that someday become needles.”

Comey said Mateen first came to the attention of FBI in May 2013, when he worked as a security guard at a local courthouse. Mateen had told his coworkers he was a member of terrorist group Hezbollah, his family had ties to al-Qaeda, and he told coworkers that “he hoped law enforcement would raid his apartment and assault his wife and child so he could martyr himself.” The FBI spent 10 months investigating him, which including interviewing him twice, following him, recording his conversations with informants, and surveilling his communications. Mateen said he made those remarks because he felt his coworkers were discriminating against him for being Muslim, and the investigation was dropped.

The FBI looked into him again in July of 2014, when they learned Mateen and the American suicide bomber who died in Syria attended the same mosque in Florida.

Comey also gave more details of the phone calls the shooter made to 911 dispatchers during Sunday’s attack. Mateen dialed 911 twice. The dispatcher called him back after that, and then Mateen pledged loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, and expressed solidarity with the bombers of the 2013 Boston Marathon and an American citizen who carried out a suicide bombing in Syria in 2014.

President Obama says it appears Omar Mateen was radicalized by extremist propaganda disseminated on the Internet. Here’s an excerpt from his remarks at the White House made after he received a security briefing:

The president’s remarks also touched on gun control, the Islamic State, and violence against the LGBT community.

Omar Mateen’s former wife, Sitora Yusufiy, is speaking to reporters about the Orlando gunman, recalling his “instability” and his violence toward her.

Here’s what she said about Mateen, via USA Today:

Yusufiy’s family extricated her from her marriage when Mateen became violent toward her, she said, and they no longer were in contact.

The Orlando Police Department has revised the death toll in Sunday’s shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the city, to 49. The 50th body belonged to the shooter, Omar Mateen, the department said.

Forty-eight of the 49 victims have been identified, the department said, and the next of kin of 24 of the victims have been notified. At a news conference Monday, which was tweeted by the department, Chief John Mina described what happened at Pulse early Sunday morning:

Good morning. New details are emerging about Omar Mateen, the man who killed 50 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.

Here’s how The New York Times begins its story:

We are also learning the names of more of the victims at the popular gay nightclub. The City of Orlando says it will update the list as the families of the victims are notified.

Meanwhile, the Islamic State radio called Mateen “one of the soldiers of the caliphate in America.” What that means isn’t exactly clear: We don’t know if Mateen was affiliated with the group or inspired by it.

We're signing off for the night. Coverage will resume at 6 a.m. Monday morning.

Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks says earlier reports that a man arrested earlier today in Los Angeles intended to harm the L.A. Pride Festival were inaccurate.

The Los Angeles Times has more:

Host James Corden opened tonight’s Tony Awards in New York City on a somber note by paying tribute to the Orlando shooting victims.

The New York Daily News reported that the cast of ""Hamilton,"" a popular Revolutionary War musical, won't use muskets in their performance during tonight's ceremonies out of respect for the victims.

Donald Trump's condolence message also took aim at his likely Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. In a statement, the Clinton campaign fired back against him and his comments on the shooting.

In New York City, two towers will make two different tributes tonight.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday afternoon that One World Trade Center will “be lit [in] the colors of the pride flag in a tribute to LGBT Americans and the lives that were lost.”

At the same time, the Empire State Building announced its upper floors will not be lit at all in memory of the deceased.

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump offering his condolences. He also said President Obama “should step down” and his likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton “should get out of this race for the Presidency” for not calling the attacks “radical Islamic terrorism.”

Trump added that he planned to make a “major speech” on foreign policy on Monday. He did not acknowledge that the victims were members of the LGBT community.

In a subsequent tweet, Trump also seemed to reference his proposed ban on Muslim immigration, which he first suggested last December after the San Bernardino shootings.

In May, Trump said the ban was “just a suggestion.” Mateen was born in New York.

Democratic presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both offered their condolences to the victims in Orlando. Clinton’s statement focused on terrorism, the LGBT community, and gun control:

Sanders’ statement touched on the same themes. He issued it before President Obama and the FBI said they believed the shooting was an act of terror:

The city of Orlando is posting the names of victims whose families have been notified on the city website. Only four names have been released so far.

FBI Special Agent Ronald Hopper definitively identified the gunman as 29-year-old Omar Mateen at an afternoon press conference. He said Mateen died in an exchange of gunfire at the Pulse nightclub. Mateen, who was born in New York, was an American citizen of whom the bureau had been aware since 2013, Hopper said. He’d been investigated and questioned in 2013 and 2014, but the FBI didn’t find enough to merit a continued investigation of Mateen, Hopper said.

Hopper said Mateen had made 911 calls before his death. He declined to elaborate on the content of those calls, but said they had “become federal evidence [and] ...it was general to the Islamic State.” News reports had previously said Mateen had in the 911 calls pledged allegiance to ISIS, as the group is also known.

Trevor Velinor, an assistant special agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, said Mateen had legally purchased both of the weapons used in the attack in the past few days.

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, via its Amaq news agency.

To put this in context, we’ll turn to Rukmini Callimachi, The New York Times reporter, who has been tweeting about the attacks:

The U.K. royal family says it is shocked by the killings. Here’s a tweet from its official account:

CNN and others are reporting that Omar Mateen, the man named by several news organizations and a U.S. congressman as being responsible for the shooting, worked as a security guard for G4S Secure Solutions. Here’s a statement from the firm, via CNN:

“Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history,” President Obama said as he addressed the nation from the White House. He stressed the FBI’s investigation was just beginning and he offered no details on the attacker’s motives or associations. “Although it is early in the investigation, we know enough to say this is an act of terror and an act of hate,” he said.

While paying tribute to the victims, the president also noted the singular role of gay bars and nightclubs in the LGBT community, describing them as “a place of solidarity and empowerment, where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.”

While Obama did address gun violence in general, he spoke with a sense of resignation about the intractable debate over gun control. “This massacre is … a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that let's them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub,” he said. “And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to tactically do nothing is a decision as well.”

“In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,” Obama said. “We will not give in to fear and turn against each other.”

Pope Francis condemned “this new manifestation of homicidal folly and senseless hatred” in a statement about the Orlando shootings, Vatican Radio said.

“Pope Francis joins the families of the victims and all of the injured in prayer and in compassion,” the Vatican’s statement said. “Sharing in their indescribable suffering he entrusts them to the Lord so they may find comfort.”

Interviews with relatives and friends have provided a glimpse into the lives of some of the victims. WFTV, the ABC affiliate in Orlando, spoke to Robert Guerrero, the cousin of Juan Ramon Guerrero, one of the victims. Robert Guerrero said his cousin came out as gay earlier this year. More from WFTV:

The Tampa Bay Times spoke to Rosalia Ramos, the mother of Stanley Almodovar. Ramos had made her son tomato-and-cheese dip to eat after he returned from Pulse. More:

Seddique Mateen Mir, speaking to reporters at his home in Port St. Lucie, Florida, earlier Monday:

Here are more of his remarks, via The New York Times: “The United States is my home and it has always taken care of me and my family. wish I knew what he was doing. I would have arrested him myself.”

The City of Orlando has named all but four of the victims in Sunday’s attack. Full list here.

Hillary Clinton gives her first speech since the shooting

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee described the Orlando shooter as a “lone wolf.” The threat of ISIS is “metastasizing,” Clinton said. “We saw this in Paris and we saw it in Brussels. We face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the so-called lone wolves, radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization.”

Clinton began her remarks by saying “today is not a day for politics,” but minutes later she began to list several prescriptions for combating ISIS abroad and gun violence on U.S. soil. Here’s an excerpt:

Clinton was referring to the fact that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was placed on an FBI terrorism watch list in 2013 and 2014 when the agency investigated him for potential ties to terrorism. Mateen was not on a watch list at the time of the shooting. The guns Mateen used in the shooting were purchased legally.

FBI Director James Comey in a news conference detailed what investigators have learned about Mateen. “There are strong indications of radicalization by this killer and a potential of inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations,” Comey said.

Comey purposely did not use Mateen’s name throughout his remarks, saying “part of what motivates sick people to do this kind of thing is some twisted notion of fame or glory, and I don’t want to be part of that for the sake of the victims and their families, and so that other twisted minds don’t think that this is a path to fame and recognition.”

He said investigators are examining Mateen’s electronic devices. He said there is no indication so far that Mateen received instruction from abroad or was part of a terrorist network. Mateen was “radicalized, and at least, in some part, through the internet.” Investigators are “working to understand what role anti-gay bigotry played in motivating this attack,” he said.

“We are looking for needles in a nationwide haystack,” Comey said. “But were also called upon to figure out which pieces of hay that someday become needles.”

Comey said Mateen first came to the attention of FBI in May 2013, when he worked as a security guard at a local courthouse. Mateen had told his coworkers he was a member of terrorist group Hezbollah, his family had ties to al-Qaeda, and he told coworkers that “he hoped law enforcement would raid his apartment and assault his wife and child so he could martyr himself.” The FBI spent 10 months investigating him, which including interviewing him twice, following him, recording his conversations with informants, and surveilling his communications. Mateen said he made those remarks because he felt his coworkers were discriminating against him for being Muslim, and the investigation was dropped.

The FBI looked into him again in July of 2014, when they learned Mateen and the American suicide bomber who died in Syria attended the same mosque in Florida.

Comey also gave more details of the phone calls the shooter made to 911 dispatchers during Sunday’s attack. Mateen dialed 911 twice. The dispatcher called him back after that, and then Mateen pledged loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, and expressed solidarity with the bombers of the 2013 Boston Marathon and an American citizen who carried out a suicide bombing in Syria in 2014.

President Obama says it appears Omar Mateen was radicalized by extremist propaganda disseminated on the Internet. Here’s an excerpt from his remarks at the White House made after he received a security briefing:

The president’s remarks also touched on gun control, the Islamic State, and violence against the LGBT community.

Omar Mateen’s former wife, Sitora Yusufiy, is speaking to reporters about the Orlando gunman, recalling his “instability” and his violence toward her.

Here’s what she said about Mateen, via USA Today:

Yusufiy’s family extricated her from her marriage when Mateen became violent toward her, she said, and they no longer were in contact.

The Orlando Police Department has revised the death toll in Sunday’s shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in the city, to 49. The 50th body belonged to the shooter, Omar Mateen, the department said.

Forty-eight of the 49 victims have been identified, the department said, and the next of kin of 24 of the victims have been notified. At a news conference Monday, which was tweeted by the department, Chief John Mina described what happened at Pulse early Sunday morning:

Good morning. New details are emerging about Omar Mateen, the man who killed 50 people and wounded 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.

Here’s how The New York Times begins its story:

We are also learning the names of more of the victims at the popular gay nightclub. The City of Orlando says it will update the list as the families of the victims are notified.

Meanwhile, the Islamic State radio called Mateen “one of the soldiers of the caliphate in America.” What that means isn’t exactly clear: We don’t know if Mateen was affiliated with the group or inspired by it.

We're signing off for the night. Coverage will resume at 6 a.m. Monday morning.

Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks says earlier reports that a man arrested earlier today in Los Angeles intended to harm the L.A. Pride Festival were inaccurate.

The Los Angeles Times has more:

Host James Corden opened tonight’s Tony Awards in New York City on a somber note by paying tribute to the Orlando shooting victims.

The New York Daily News reported that the cast of ""Hamilton,"" a popular Revolutionary War musical, won't use muskets in their performance during tonight's ceremonies out of respect for the victims.

Donald Trump's condolence message also took aim at his likely Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. In a statement, the Clinton campaign fired back against him and his comments on the shooting.

In New York City, two towers will make two different tributes tonight.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday afternoon that One World Trade Center will “be lit [in] the colors of the pride flag in a tribute to LGBT Americans and the lives that were lost.”

At the same time, the Empire State Building announced its upper floors will not be lit at all in memory of the deceased.

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump offering his condolences. He also said President Obama “should step down” and his likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton “should get out of this race for the Presidency” for not calling the attacks “radical Islamic terrorism.”

Trump added that he planned to make a “major speech” on foreign policy on Monday. He did not acknowledge that the victims were members of the LGBT community.

In a subsequent tweet, Trump also seemed to reference his proposed ban on Muslim immigration, which he first suggested last December after the San Bernardino shootings.

In May, Trump said the ban was “just a suggestion.” Mateen was born in New York.

Democratic presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both offered their condolences to the victims in Orlando. Clinton’s statement focused on terrorism, the LGBT community, and gun control:

Sanders’ statement touched on the same themes. He issued it before President Obama and the FBI said they believed the shooting was an act of terror:

The city of Orlando is posting the names of victims whose families have been notified on the city website. Only four names have been released so far.

FBI Special Agent Ronald Hopper definitively identified the gunman as 29-year-old Omar Mateen at an afternoon press conference. He said Mateen died in an exchange of gunfire at the Pulse nightclub. Mateen, who was born in New York, was an American citizen of whom the bureau had been aware since 2013, Hopper said. He’d been investigated and questioned in 2013 and 2014, but the FBI didn’t find enough to merit a continued investigation of Mateen, Hopper said.

Hopper said Mateen had made 911 calls before his death. He declined to elaborate on the content of those calls, but said they had “become federal evidence [and] ...it was general to the Islamic State.” News reports had previously said Mateen had in the 911 calls pledged allegiance to ISIS, as the group is also known.

Trevor Velinor, an assistant special agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, said Mateen had legally purchased both of the weapons used in the attack in the past few days.

The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, via its Amaq news agency.

To put this in context, we’ll turn to Rukmini Callimachi, The New York Times reporter, who has been tweeting about the attacks:

The U.K. royal family says it is shocked by the killings. Here’s a tweet from its official account:

CNN and others are reporting that Omar Mateen, the man named by several news organizations and a U.S. congressman as being responsible for the shooting, worked as a security guard for G4S Secure Solutions. Here’s a statement from the firm, via CNN:

“Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history,” President Obama said as he addressed the nation from the White House. He stressed the FBI’s investigation was just beginning and he offered no details on the attacker’s motives or associations. “Although it is early in the investigation, we know enough to say this is an act of terror and an act of hate,” he said.

While paying tribute to the victims, the president also noted the singular role of gay bars and nightclubs in the LGBT community, describing them as “a place of solidarity and empowerment, where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.”

While Obama did address gun violence in general, he spoke with a sense of resignation about the intractable debate over gun control. “This massacre is … a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that let's them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub,” he said. “And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to tactically do nothing is a decision as well.”

“In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,” Obama said. “We will not give in to fear and turn against each other.”

Pope Francis condemned “this new manifestation of homicidal folly and senseless hatred” in a statement about the Orlando shootings, Vatican Radio said.

“Pope Francis joins the families of the victims and all of the injured in prayer and in compassion,” the Vatican’s statement said. “Sharing in their indescribable suffering he entrusts them to the Lord so they may find comfort.”

The Los Angeles Times is reporting a man with guns and possible explosives was arrested in Santa Monica on Sunday. He reportedly told police he was going to the city’s gay-pride rally. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is scheduled to take part in the celebrations in LA. Several cities around the U.S., including Boston and Washington, D.C., held gay-pride celebrations this weekend. Here’s a complete list.

Sunday’s shooting comes during LGBT Pride Month, and law-enforcement agencies in major U.S. cities are stepping up their presence at LGBT sites and events. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said D.C. police will bolster their presence this weekend at Capitol Pride, the region’s annual LGBT-pride event, during Sunday’s festival.

In New York City, the NYPD said it placed its patrol and counter-terrorism units on alert. A New York Daily News reporter tweeted that armed NYPD officers have been placed outside the historic Stonewall Inn.

Florida Governor Rick Scott has declared a state of emergency in Orange County, freeing up more state law-enforcement resources to assist in Orlando.

Addressing reporters in Orlando, Scott said the state “would provide all the resources anyone needs” in response to the shooting.

President Obama will make a statement about the Orlando shooting at 1:30 p.m. ET, the White House says. Vice President Joe Biden has also canceled his planned appearance at a campaign fundraiser in Florida tonight.

OneBlood, a blood-donation organization in Orlando, is asking for donations on its Twitter feed:

But gay men, under current FDA rules, will be unable to donate blood to those in need after the attack.

Mayor Buddy Dyer said 50 people have been killed and 53 others taken to local hospitals.

“There’s blood everywhere,” he said at a news conference, adding the shooter used an assault rifle during the attack. He said he had asked the governor to declare a state of emergency.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said a handgun and an AR-15-type assault rifle was recovered from the scene. He said an unknown number of rounds were fired.

FBI said the investigation was in its early stages, and the bureau was investigating all angles, including whether it was a hate crime and if it was terrorism.

Imam Muhammad Musri, president of American Islam and the Islamic Society of Central Florida, urged the media not to rush to judgment. “It’s our worst nightmare, and we are sorry to know it happened to us,” he said.

Congressman Alan Grayson, Democrat of Florida, at a news conference identified the shooter as Omar Mateen. He said Mateen was in his late 20s. He said the gunman was a U.S. citizen, but that is “not true of some of his family members.” Grayson’s congressional district includes part of Orlando.

USA Today has more on Pulse, the club where the attack took place, and which labels itself as “not just another gay club.” An excerpt:

Multiple news organizations, including CBS News and NBC, citing anonymous law-enforcement sources, have identified the suspect as Omar Mateen, 27, of Port St. Lucie, Florida. We have not independently confirmed their reporting.

The presumptive Republican and Democratic presidential nominees shared their thoughts:

The White House says President Obama has been briefed on the attack.

Multiple people have been killed and at least 42 people are being treated at local hospitals after a gunman opened fire and took hostages at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday, police said. The gunman is dead.

At a news conference Sunday, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said “multiple people are dead inside” the Pulse nightclub in downtown Orlando, but he declined to provide an exact number, saying the number was about 20. Forty-two people have been transported to local hospitals, he said. Mayor Buddy Dyer called it a “crime that will have a lasting effect on our community.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, at the same news conference, called it a “domestic terror incident,” and an FBI official said there are “suggestions that the individual may have leanings towards (Islamist) ideology,” but he added the bureau was pursing other angles as well.

The shooter was found dead inside the club, Mina said. One officer was lightly injured, he said.

The shooter had an assault-type rifle, a handgun, and some type of device on him, he said. Officials at the news conference described the gunman as well-prepared and well-organized. He was not from the area, they said.

Pulse is a popular nightspot that hosts what it calls “Upscale Latin Saturdays” with three DJs and a show a midnight. On its Facebook page, the club warned customers to “get out of pulse and keep running.” A subsequent message said:

The shooting comes a little more than a day after a gunman shot and killed Christina Grimmie, the singer, at a concert venue in the city. Officials at the news conference said the two incidents were not connected.","The FBI is seeking the public’s help to piece together why Omar Mateen selected the Pulse nightclub as his target.

It’s a tried-and-true legal manoeuvre.

Companies that lose big at trial often run across the street to bankruptcy court, looking for protection from their newest – and usually biggest – creditor. In the case of Nick Denton and his web publishing empire, the decision to seek court protection had the added benefit of buying time.



A judge in Florida declined to overturn the US$140 million state court judgment in the Hulk Hogan sex tape case, so the bankruptcy petition stopped the clock, allowing Gawker to focus on selling off its best units, including Gizmodo and Deadspin, to media giant Ziff Davis for US$100 million, according to people familiar with the deal. The sale will take place as a bankruptcy auction, allowing for better bids down the line. In doing so, Gawker sidestepped, for now, paying off Hogan’s invasion-of-privacy verdict in a case funded by Denton’s declared nemesis, tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who has been helping bankroll Hogan’s case and others. Gawker’s lawyers also asked the Manhattan bankruptcy court to shield Denton himself from paying the verdict, as well as other lawsuits, a request that isn’t guaranteed to be granted.

“Forestalling payment on the judgment seems to be the purpose of this bankruptcy,” said Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy expert and law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles. He explained that “a judgment is simply a mature debt”, like the thousands of dollars Gawker owes its law firms, Google and others.

But if a public intellectual, such as a poet, playwright, novelist, musician, actor, or athlete is such, while it may be an issue for those around them, it has little direct effect on the American people.

But if such a person is competing for the Presidency, or is an occupant of the Oval Office, it is a much more disturbing and dangerous scenario, particularly in an age of nuclear weapons, terrorism, and domestic discontent leading to rejection of the established political order. Such is what is now faced with the meteoric rise of businessman Donald Trump, who is seen by many as narcissistic. He displays delusions of grandeur, often seems not to grasp reality, and doesn’t understand the limits the Constitution places on the president and the Congress.

Would Donald Trump be the first President to display such traits of egomania and narcissism? The answer is clearly negative, as one can observe that Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon all had elements in their personalities that resembled the characteristics that Trump clearly has, but none on his – Trumpian – scale.

Andrew Jackson had a mercurial personality, and his temper and belief in his own superiority helped lead to rash actions. When President James Monroe ordered the invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818, Jackson went ahead and burned down Seminole towns, including Tallahassee; and when he found two British nationals (Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambrister) in Spanish Florida, he ordered summary justice, leading to their execution, without consulting President Monroe or Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, causing an international controversy with the nation we had recently engaged in war from 1812-1815. This caused political conflict with both John Quincy Adams and John C. Calhoun (Secretary of War), who became his major political rivals during the next two decades of his national political life. Jackson’s readiness to lead an invasion of South Carolina during the Nullification Crisis in 1832-1833 only was prevented by compromise promoted by Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, another political rival, after their election contest for Jackson’s second term in 1832. Jackson’s repudiation of the Supreme Court ruling concerning the right of Native American to their ancestral lands, which led to the Trail of Tears (one of the most reprehensible Presidential actions in all of American history), undermined the rule of law. His determination to destroy the Second National Bank of the United States, leading to the Panic of 1837, helped to defeat his favored successor, Martin Van Buren, when he ran for reelection in 1840, as Van Buren could not easily repudiate his mentor’s actions on the economy. In many ways, Jackson may have been the most dangerous President until Richard Nixon 140 years later.

Theodore Roosevelt loved public attention so much that he felt a need to comment on everything and everyone in his lifetime. He was boastful on a regular basis and tried to make news headlines in every possible manner. He engaged in what many called “cowboy diplomacy” toward Latin America, with interventions in Cuba and the Dominican Republic, pursuing what came to be called Big Stick Diplomacy. He bragged about “building” the Panama Canal after arranging a treaty that was foisted on the new Panama nation, leading to great resentment in that country. He became engaged in a very divisive and contentious Presidential campaign against his own chosen successor, President William Howard Taft, in 1912, using insults not all that different from what we’ve heard from Donald Trump against his Republican rivals for the 2016 nomination. He was ready to lead troops to fight Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany during the Great War had President Woodrow Wilson, whom TR hated with a passion, allowed it. He craved the praise that foreign governments gave to him when he toured European capitals after his Presidency. He challenged the norms of what a President could do domestically, expanding the definition of Presidential power, seen as significant and historic, but also questioned by many over time. His ego was driven also by his own insecurities, which he had developed in childhood from bouts with asthma and poor eyesight, which made him want to be noticed and respected. Always a colorful character, one has to wonder how he would have led the nation into World War I, had he been elected in 1912. Would he have handled the issue of domestic criticism and opposition any different from fellow progressive Woodrow Wilson, whom history chastises for violating civil liberties?

Lyndon B. Johnson was another colorful character in the Oval Office. He gave his daughters names that corresponded with his own initials: LBJ. He was infamous for being overbearing with legislators in private meetings, and aggressive and belligerent toward critics in the news media and in Congress. He overworked his staff. He lived and breathed politics all the time. He had a reputation of practicing “in your face” politics and intimidated critics of the Vietnam War. His unwillingness, until 1968, to listen to others who advised him to change his Vietnam War policy doomed the United States in Vietnam. His policy led to one of the major failures any President has sustained while in office. Even with his tremendous ego, he also had a clear sense of his own insecurities and weaknesses, and at times, it made him drink and smoke and swear too much. LBJ was a man of great accomplishments, but also great shortcomings, and he was dogged by a desire to be loved by the American people.

Richard Nixon was, without question, the most dangerous man ever to occupy the Presidency. Born into poverty, he never overcame his resentment of wealthy people, such as the Rockefellers and the Kennedys. He had very low self esteem as part of his basic nature, and saw his opponents and critics as his enemies and used the power of the Presidency to gain revenge on them. He gathered loyalists around him who would do his bidding. More than any other President he found it hard to deal with the news media. (One wonders how he would have handled the 24-hour news media of the 21st century.) He worked to cover up much of what he ordered the military to do in Southeast Asia and saw no problem violating morals or ethics when the national interest, as he perceived it, required it. He ordered break-ins and wiretapping on a massive scale and had an “enemies list,” which was used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service to harass his critics. People high up in the government worried that he might declare martial law during Watergate. He didn’t, but we came very close to this threat becoming reality, and that is why Watergate is thought to be the third greatest crisis in American history, after the Civil War, and the Great Depression and World War II.

Now we face the growing danger of Donald Trump, who is perceived by this author (see my previous article about Trump on HNN) as the most dangerous Presidential candidate in American history. Many conservatives, as well as progressives and neutral observers, see Trump as a Fascist, who appeals to the fears, anxieties, and prejudices of those with less education and economic stature. Trump builds up the fear of Muslims and Hispanics with his nativism and racism. He promotes the disrespect of women with his misogyny, and promises everything will be fine in both domestic and foreign policy, even though he has given no real specifics on any of the issues. His bluster and braggadocio are totally out of line for any President, yet Trump seems not to realize that every word he utters leads to false assumptions and confusion that could undermine America’s worldwide image.

His recent comments on foreign policy have caused great alarm among experts in diplomacy, defense and national security. Among other wild statements, he has suggested ending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as the major bulwark of American foreign policy and backed the spread of nuclear weapons to Japan and South Korea. He has praised Vladimir Putin and suggested he’d be willing to meet with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Trump’s use of insults against anyone who is critical of him, and his threats to curb freedom of the press and freedom of speech against his naysayers, is terrifying. The Presidency is not a place for a novice like Trump, who would enter the Presidency as a “blank slate” with no real understanding of major public issues.

The one common theme among Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon are their years in the military and in government and their knowledge, even when they engaged at times in deplorable behavior. But with Donald Trump, who has zero military and government experience, and is the most ignorant Presidential nominee in American history, we are dealing with a candidate who has more of a “mobocracy” following, similar to those who stormed the White House at the Inauguration of Jackson in 1829. It is reasonable to fear that events could unhinge Trump.

The American Republic could be facing its greatest constitutional threat since Richard Nixon in 1974, and yet there is still time to prevent this from happening, and that is the responsibility of all of us in the historical community to make clear to everyone that Donald Trump has no magic potion, and no simple answers to the complex world we live in, and that we can ill afford to put this potential demagogue into the Oval Office.",He’d be the worst.

Shocked clubbers have described the bloody scenes inside a gay nightclub after it was attacked by a gunman.

A lone attacker armed with a gun stormed into the Pulse Club in Orlando, Florida shortly after 2am.

He then began opening fire in the packed club with police saying there are mass casualties.

Orlando Police later confirmed the gunman had been shot dead. It is not yet known how many people have been injured.

Speaking outside, one clubber described the terrifying scene.

He told the Orlando Sentinel: ""I just heard the continuous bang of the gun.

""It was just 'bang,bang, bang' and constant screaming.

""I know that the guy next to me was shot and I thought I could feel liquid but it was blood.

""I then looked around and everybody was falling and dropping and screaming and the privacy fence went down.

""I crawled out and I know that when you hear the banging you are not shot.

""I just know that it was very scary and very emotional. I was not an experience I want to go through again.""

Erickson Robledo said on Facebook: ""My friend is there. He almost got shot.

""He is ok. But he just told me that there could be over 20 dead people. He even help people to get out while they were bleeding.""

The shooting happened at the Pulse Club in Orlando causing people to flee in terror.

Eyewitnesses say the attacker stormed the club before shooting about 20 people.

The gunman is feared to have shot towards the crowd, with about 100 people inside.

Stewart Moore, a local journalist, said the attacker is still inside the club and is feared to be wearing a bomb, the BBC reported.

The club posted on its Facebook page warning revellers to ""get out of pulse and keep running.""

Police have described the incident as ongoing. It is now believed that more than one gunman stormed the club.

Ricardo Negron Almodovar was in the club. He wrote on Facebook: ""I was there.

""Shooter opened fire @ around 2:00am. People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran.

""I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well :( .""

Eyewitness Rosie Feba was in the club with her girlfriend.

She described the moment the shooting happened and said as she ran out of the club she saw a man who had been shot.

Speaking to the Orlando Sentinal, she said: ""Everyone was getting on the floor.

I told her [girlfriend] I didn't think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.""

After firing on people in the club, the gunman held several people hostage and barricaded himself inside Pulse Orlando nightclub.

The fire department bomb squad are at the scene and a controlled explosion was carried out by law enforcement operatives inside the club, say authorities. Shooting was said to have started around 2am with one person telling Sky News: ""People just dropped on the floor. I guess the shooter was shooting at the ceiling because you could see all the glass from the lamps falling.""

The police force described the scene as a ""mass casualty situation"" and said support was coming from local, state and federal agencies. They tweeted that the gunman had been killed just before 6am local time in Florida.

Differing reports have suggested that at least 20-25 people have been injured. Pulse Orlando wrote on their Facebook page ""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running"".

Ricardo Negron Almodovar told BBC News that the shooter opened fire as the Latin-themed club night was closing. ""We heard rapid fire go off. In the room I was in, people went down to the floor. I wasn't able to see the shooter or people get hurt.

""At some point, there was a brief pause, and a group of us got up and went to the exit that leads to the patio area outside. We found an exit and after that... I just ran.""

Rosie Feba told Orlando Sentinel she and her girlfriend were in the club near closing time when, ""she told me someone was shooting. Everyone was getting on the floor. I told her I didn't think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.""

Another eyewitness, Anthony Torres, reported that he heard people screaming that others in the nightclub were dead.",The shooter had barricaded himself inside the nightclub after opening fire on people inside.

(AP) — It had been an evening of drinking, dancing and drag shows. After hours of revelry, the party-goers crowding the gay nightclub known as the Pulse took their last sips before the place closed.

That’s when authorities say Omar Mateen emerged, carrying an AR-15 and spraying the helpless crowd with bullets. Witnesses said he fired relentlessly — 20 rounds, 40, then 50 and more. In such tight quarters, the bullets could hardly miss. He shot at police. He took hostages.

When the gunfire finally stopped, 50 people were dead and dozens critically wounded in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen, who authorities said had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a 911 call shortly before the attack, died in a gun battle with SWAT team members.

Authorities immediately began investigating whether the assault was an act of terrorism and probing the background of Mateen, a 29-year-old American citizen from Fort Pierce, Florida, who had worked as a security guard. The gunman’s father recalled that his son recently got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami and said that might be related to the assault.

Thirty-nine of the dead were killed at the club, and 11 people died at hospitals, Mayor Buddy Dyer said.

Jon Alamo had been dancing at the Pulse for hours when he wandered into the club’s main room just in time to see the gunman. “You ever seen how Marine guys hold big weapons, shooting from left to right? That’s how he was shooting at people,” he said.

“My first thought was, oh my God, I’m going to die,” Alamo said. “I was praying to God that I would live to see another day.”

Pulse patron Eddie Justice texted his mother, Mina: “Mommy I love you. In club they shooting.” About 30 minutes later, hiding in a bathroom, he texted her: “He’s coming. I’m gonna die.” As Sunday wore on, she awaited word on his fate.

At least 53 people were hospitalized, most in critical condition, and a surgeon at Orlando Regional Medical Center said the death toll was likely to climb.

The previous deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. was the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech, where a student killed 32 people before killing himself.

Mateen’s family was from Afghanistan, and he was born in New York. His family later moved to Florida, authorities said.

A law enforcement official said the gunman made a 911 call from the club in which he professed allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The official was familiar with the investigation, but was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The extremist group did not officially claim responsibility for the attack, but the IS-run Aamaq news agency cited an unnamed source as saying the attack was carried out by an Islamic State fighter.

Even if the attacker supported IS, it was unclear whether the group planned or knew of the attack beforehand.

Mateen was not unknown to law enforcement: In 2013, he made inflammatory comments to co-workers and was interviewed twice, according to FBI agent Ronald Hopper, who called the interviews inconclusive. In 2014, Hopper said, officials found that Mateen had ties to an American suicide bomber, but the agent described the contact as minimal, saying it did not constitute a threat at the time.

Asked if the gunman had a connection to radical Islamic terrorism, Hopper said authorities had “suggestions that individual has leanings towards that.”

Mateen purchased at least two firearms legally within the last week or so, according to Trevor Velinor of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

In a separate incident, an Indiana man armed with three assault rifles and chemicals used to make explosives was arrested Sunday in Southern California and told police he wanted to do harm to a gay pride parade.

The Orlando shooting started about 2 a.m., with more than 300 people inside the Pulse.

“He had an automatic rifle, so nobody stood a chance,” said Jackie Smith, who saw two friends next to her get shot. “I just tried to get out of there.”

At 2:09 a.m., Pulse posted on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running.”

Mateen exchanged gunfire with 14 police officers at the club, and took hostages at one point. In addition to the assault rifle, the shooter also had a handgun and some sort of “suspicious device,” the police chief said. About 5 a.m., authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the remaining club-goers, Police Chief John Mina said.

At first, officers mistakenly thought the gunman had strapped explosives to the dead after a bomb robot sent back images of a battery part next to a body, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said. That prevented paramedics from going in until authorities determined the battery was something that fell out of an exit sign or a smoke detector, he said.

The robot was sent in after SWAT team members put explosive charges on a wall and an armored vehicle knocked it down in an effort to rescue hostages.

Just before 6 a.m., the Pulse posted an update on its Facebook: “As soon as we have any information, we will update everyone. Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event. Thank you for your thoughts and love.”

Authorities were looking into whether the shooter acted alone, according to Danny Banks, an agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

“This is an incident, as I see it, that we certainly classify as domestic terror incident,” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.

Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News about his son seeing the men kissing a couple of months ago.

“We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident,” Seddique said. “We are in shock like the whole country.”

Mateen was a security guard with a company called G4S. In a 2012 newsletter, the firm identified him as working in West Palm Beach. In a statement sent Sunday to the Palm Beach Post, the company confirmed that he had been an employee since September 2007. State records show that Mateen had held a firearms license since at least 2011.

President Barack Obama called the shooting an “act of terror” and an “act of hate” targeting a place of “solidarity and empowerment” for gays and lesbians. He urged Americans to decide whether this is the kind of “country we want to be.”

Authorities said they had secured a van owned by the suspect outside the club. Meanwhile, a SWAT truck and a bomb-disposal unit were on the scene of an address associated with Mateen in Fort Pierce, about 120 miles southeast of Orlando.

Across the country, police departments stepped up patrols in neighborhoods frequented by the LGBT community.

Another 53 injured at Florida nightclub in worst mass shooting in US history

“Today, I’m praying for all those impacted by last night’s horrific attack on an LGBT nightclub in Orlando. Our nation stands in solidarity with the victims, their families and the City of Orlando. “While we are still learning about the shooter’s motivation, this is an act of terror and yet another mass shooting in our nation. It is also an attack on the LGBT community. “We must take every step to keep America safe, which means targeting and taking out terrorists while keeping guns out of the wrong hands. It’s time for Congress to finally act on gun violence and ban military-style weapons, put limits on clips and magazine sizes, ban those on the terrorist watch-list from purchasing firearms and require background checks on all gun sales. “We know that the shooter in Orlando used a high-powered weapon that allowed him to fire a large number of bullets in rapid succession. This shooting is now the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.” Casey will host a press conference tomorrow following his meeting with LGBT community leaders in Pittsburgh to discuss steps he feels the U.S. government must take immediately to address safety concerns across the country from commonsense gun laws to ongoing acts of hate. “Details are still emerging, but the massacre in Orlando has all of the hallmarks of a terrorist attack and is being investigated as one. Early indications are that the shooter was U.S. born, but may have believed in a radical Islamic agenda similar to that of ISIS. “There can be no question that there is evil in the world and that it is at war with the West. We had better wake up to that reality and understand that there are already aspiring terrorists in our midst. “My prayers are with the victims and their families and with our brave law enforcement officers on the front lines in this fight.” In accordance with President Obama’s proclamation, Gov. Tom Wolf has ordered all United States and Pennsylvania flags at the Capitol Complex, Commonwealth facilities, and all public buildings and grounds throughout the state lowered to half-staff, effective immediately. This order is to mark respect for the victims of the attack at an LGBT club that took place early this morning in Orlando, Florida. “Frances and I send our thoughts and prayers to the victims, their families, and the entire Orlando community for the tragic and senseless terror attack and hate crime that occurred early this morning in Florida. I ask all Pennsylvanians to participate in this tribute on behalf of all who were lost and injured.” Flags should be flown at half-staff until sunset on June 16, 2016 per President Obama’s proclamation. ‎”My heart goes out to the loved ones of those murdered at the nightclub in Orlando this morning. “Law enforcement officials are investigating this shooting as an act of terrorism, and it appears to have taken many lives. “I extend my condolences to the family and friends of those killed and am praying for the wounded who are undergoing medical treatment.”","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — It had been an evening of drinking, dancing and drag shows. After hours of revelry, the party-goers crowding the gay nightclub known as the Pulse took their last sips before the place closed.

Orlando has declared a state of emergency.

“This was an act of terror, and an act of hate,” President Obama said just after 2 p.m. “This could have been any one of our communities.”

The shooter had an AR-15 type assault rifle, a handgun and possibly a “suspicious” device, according to the sheriff. The suspicious device possibility was later discarded, as officials said all the murders were conducted with the assault weapon and the handgun. Police say the assailant was not from Orlando. The shooter held some people hostage before he was killed by police. The club, in a statement, said it was at capacity, with some 300 people, when the attack broke out.

“Everyone get out of pulse and keep running,” a message on Pulse’s Facebook page stated shortly after the attack began.

In an early-morning news conference, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings called the shooting a “domestic act of terrorism.” An FBI official said the gunman may have had “leanings” toward Islamist extremism. “We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings towards that, that particular ideology,” the FBI’s Agent Ronald Hopper of the agency’s Tampa division said at the first news conference. “But right now we can’t say definitively, so we’re still running everything around.”

By the 10:30 news conference, police were saying that they could not yet determine whether it was an act of terrorism or a hate crime. And by 1 p.m., reports based on alleged interviews with the shooter’s family in Port St. Lucie were connecting the attack to a hate crime–that the shooter was motivated by hate for gay people, which may explain why he traveled the 100-mile distance from his home to a well-publicized, highly attended LGBT event in Orlando.

The FBI confirmed that the shooting was carried out by Omar Mateen, of Port St. Lucie, who had twice been interviewed by the FBI, in 2013 and 2014, to follow up on allegations that he’d made statements of sympathy to ISIS. There was no evidence to pursue the case beyond those interviews, the FBI said in a 3:15 p.m. news conference, finding his alleged ties “inconclusive.” He was “not under current investigation at the time of this incident and he was not under surveillance,” Hopper said. He had bought the two firearms involved in today’s shooting within the last few days, officials said. He had been working for an American security firm for nine years–a firm that had contracts with federal government agencies to provide them security.

Speaking to media at about 11:45 a.m., U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said: “I asked the FBI if there was any connection to Islamic radicalism. There appears to be. But they are naturally cautious and waiting throughout to see if this is [as] the facts emerge. I have checked with intelligence staff and they do believe that there is some connection to ISIS, but I might say this is not official. I asked the FBI what I should convey, and because of the nature of this shooting, they have asked me to ask anybody that knows anything about the shooter, especially in the Ft. Pierce St. Lucie area, to please come forth with the information. This appears to be, unfortunately, since it’s the largest mass shooting, an act of terrorism. But the facts, we can’t say that totally yet.”

Nelson was in Orlando, near the scene of the massacre. He does not appear to have been informed about the potential motivations of the shooter’s hatred for gay people, though hatred for gays–and violence toward gays–and Islamist fanaticism are not necessarily mutually exclusive: Islamist regimes such as the Taliban or Iran and terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS have notorious records of brutality and atrocities toward gay, lesbian and transgender people, wherever they’ve held sway. But so far officials and analysts have stressed that there is no evidence of more than possible “sympathizing” between the Orlando shooter and Islamists–and even that link has not been confirmed, though officials have also reported that he made a phone call before the shooting pledging his allegiance to ISIS.

Hours after the attacks, the New York Times reported, “the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre, in a statement released over an encrypted phone app used by the group, stating that the attack ‘was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,’ according to a transcript provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist propaganda.” CNN, however, said it was not ISIS itself that took direct responsibility, but an Arab news agency citing a source and attributing the attack to ISIS.

None of the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the United States since 9/11 have been carried out by affiliates of either ISIS or al-Qaeda, but rather by lone wolves inspired by the organizations. (The holy month of Ramadan began on June 5.)

At 1:40 p.m., KABC, the ABC affiliate in Los Angeles, was reporting that authorities took a suspect in custody in Santa Monica “after discovering an arsenal in his car that included tannerite powder, assault weapons and a camouflage outfit.” The man was taken in after a traffic stop. “Officers found five pounds of tannerite-type powder, assault weapons, long rifles, clips loaded and taped together and a camouflage outfit along with a security badge.” The Los Angeles mayor said that incident is unrelated to the attack in Orlando.

NBC News reported that it had contacted the man it said is the shooter’s father, who told NBC: “We are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren’t aware of any action he was taking. We are in shock, like the whole country.” His son, he said, was “angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami a couple months ago.”

Around 9:20 a.m., CBS News and ABC News identified the attacker as Omar Mateen, 27, a U.S. citizen and resident of Port St. Lucie. He is a 2001 graduate of Spectrum High School who earned his associates degree in 2006. The assailant’s vehicle has been located near the nightclub. Television stations were showing live images of a robot, used in situations involving potential bombs, processing the vehicle around 9:45 a.m. The FBI’s Hopper told media in a 10:25 a.m. news conference that the agency had confirmed the identity of the shooter, but was not yet releasing it officially pending notification to next-of-kin.

A marriage certificate filed with the St. Lucie Clerk of Court lists Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, born Nov. 16, 1986 in New York, as having married Sitora Alisherzoda Yusufiy, now 27, a Port St. Lucie resident who was born in Uzbekistan. The marriage took place on March 31, 2009. He was employed as a security guard for federal properties and was licensed to cart weapons.

“Federal, state and local law enforcement are at what may be the home of the assailant in the Orlando mass shooting early Sunday, according to law enforcement officials,” St. Lucie County’s TCPalm website was reporting at mid-morning. “They are at a home in the 2500 block of South 17th Street, Fort Pierce, said police spokesman Ed Cunningham.” The home is registered to a Omar Mateen. Property records indicate Mateen owns the property at 2513 S 17th St., #107.

According to police, the shooting began inside the club, where a law enforcement officer, working security at the club off duty, attempted to confront the gunman. There was a brief confrontation outside the club before the gunman returned inside and took more than two dozen hostages. Police Chief John Mina said in a brief news conference this morning that law enforcement decided to rescue the hostages at about 5 a.m., triggering a “controlled explosion” in the process. One law enforcement officer was injured.

Police say there is no reason to believe that there is any additional threat to the Orlando area. People who’d been at the club during the shooting and who survived were bused to Orlando police headquarters for interviews.

“There was some communication” with the gunman before the gunman went back into the club, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at the 10:30 news conference, “but we’re not going to release that right now.” He added, referring to police at the scene in the early part of the confrontation: “Once the initial shots were stopped, they were dealing with a hostage situation. So in that time, we need to set up, reevaluate, reassess what’s happening, and make sure that all the pieces are in place, we have enough staffing to take care of the situation, we have armored vehicles to come to the scene, and those were crucial in the rescue of those hostages.”

Referring to the tally of victims, Mina said, “Just based on what the initial officers saw, without jeopardizing any more safety, they thought there were about at least 20, but now it’s up to 50, so definitely one of the worst tragedies.” He said there was an initial shooting at 2:02 a.m., “numerous shots fired, and then there were gunshots exchanged between the SWAT team and the suspect at 0500 hours,” that is, 5 a.m. But it’s not known, he said, when the majority of the victims were killed.

The 10:30 news conference also featured Imam Muhammad Musri, who leads the Islamic Society of Central Florida and is the national president of American Islam, underscoring the growing likelihood that the shooter is a Muslim, though officials at the news conference did not make reference to ties to Islamist terrorism. “I’m here today to stand as a faith leader with our law enforcement community and our city leadership in this hour of horror that was brought upon our city,” Musri said, praising law enforcement and urging members of all faith to help where they can in the investigation. “No one could have predicted this, no one could have prepared for it. This could have happened anywhere,” he said, adding: “I want to also caution many in the media from rushing into judgment, and from sensationalizing the story, because we do not want the story to be shifted from the focus where it is. It’s a horrible tragedy. We are mourning. We are sad. We are heartbroken. And it’s not really time for any sensational news and rushing to judgment.”

“I was there,” Ricardo Negron Almodovar said on the club’s Facebook page around 3 a.m., as the gunman was still in the club. “Shooter opened fire @ around 2:00am. People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran. I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well.” He said he never had a look at the shooter. “My eyes were on the floor and as soon as there was a break, people started running out the back, including myself.”

“My daughter is in there. Please keep praying for them,” Lilbia Carmen said as the attack was unfolding. “She’s waiting for cops to be able to come out. I was on the [phone] and all I hear is shot guns.” Two hours later, she posted: “She’s out. Thanks so much for your prayers towards my princess and myself! My life is back!!! Thank you God for hearing our prayers!”

Martha Bonilla wrote: “Sadly my cousin was in their and has been shot I pray he makes it praying for him. For those that made it out I’m happy that you are all ok.. My thoughts and prayers are with all of [you].” Erickseon Robledo wrote: “My friend is there. He almost got shot. He is ok. But he just told me that there could be over 20 dead people. He even help people to get out while they were bleeding.”

It is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States, nealry doubling the death toll of the October 1991 shooting in Killeen Texas, when 27 people were killed. Florida had not known a mass-shooting since June 18, 1990, when James E. Pough, upset that his car had been repossessed, murdered seven employees and a customer at a General Motors office, a day after he had killed a man and a woman elsewhere.

But Sunday’s shooting is evoking unnerving memories of the last mass shooting at a nightclub: the Friday, Nov. 13 assault on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, where 90 people were killed by ISIS-inspired French-born terrorists as part of a larger operation targeting several areas of the city. Authorities in Orlando, however, were quick to reassure residents that Sunday’s attack was limited to Pulse. The venue is one of the largest and most popular gay clubs in Central Florida, and the attack, coincidentally or purposely, took place in the midst of Gay Pride Month.

“This is some shitty news to hear after going to Pride,” Douglas Gonzalez wrote. “My thoughts are with the victims and hope all the victims make a speedy recovery. And rest in piece to any of the people who died from this horrible attack. THIS is what us the LGBT community have fought all our lives and will continue to fight against! And to the religious assholes saying ‘doing God’s work,’ how fucking dare you! This is why we must teach people to sympathize and more importantly empathize with others! This and all the crimes that befall our community remind me that there is still work to be done.”

“The Equality Florida family is here in tears of sadness and anger that this has happened,” Nadine Smith, co-founder and president of Equality Florida, the LGBT advocacy organization, said. “If we can help, let us know. We are monitoring the news and stand ready to assist.”

“Many lives were lost and many more individuals were impacted by witnessing the crime,” Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “We are a strong, resilient community, tonight we had a crime that will have a lasting effect on our community, we need to stay strong.” Twice as many people visit Orlando every year–60 million, drawn in large part by Disney’s parks–than do Paris.

Gov. Rick Scott’s office said around 9 a.m. that the governor was heading to Orlando. Another press conference is expected around 10:15 a.m. Authorities said they’d hold a news conference about every two hours today.

Orlando police and the Orange County Sheriff’s Office were involved in the “initial entry” into the club, the sheriff said.

Pulse opened in July 2004 in what used to be Dante’s restaurant, featuring three rooms–a smokers bar, a dance floor and an ultra-lounge. It calls itself “Orlando’s Latin Hotspot,” and was holding one of its “Upscale Latin Saturdays” party last night.

“We are certainly having our share of violence in two successive nights,” Sen. Nelson said. “We’ve had two killings. The singer performing live at the plaza, shot down two nights ago, and then this horrific act. So, what is happening to our country? We are going to have to dig down deep and ask ourselves who we are as a people. We’ve got to think of ourselves as the common denominator of American, not a hyphenated American or off on some cause, and that’s what we’ve got to explore deep inside at this point.”","50 people have been killed and 53 wounded in a mass shooting by a lone gunman at Pulse Orlando, a gay nightclub on South Orange Avenue, at 2 o'clock this morning.

Orlando has declared a state of emergency.

“This was an act of terror, and an act of hate,” President Obama said just after 2 p.m. “This could have been any one of our communities.”

The shooter had an AR-15 type assault rifle, a handgun and possibly a “suspicious” device, according to the sheriff. The suspicious device possibility was later discarded, as officials said all the murders were conducted with the assault weapon and the handgun. Police say the assailant was not from Orlando. The shooter held some people hostage before he was killed by police. The club, in a statement, said it was at capacity, with some 300 people, when the attack broke out.

“Everyone get out of pulse and keep running,” a message on Pulse’s Facebook page stated shortly after the attack began.

In an early-morning news conference, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings called the shooting a “domestic act of terrorism.” An FBI official said the gunman may have had “leanings” toward Islamist extremism. “We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings towards that, that particular ideology,” the FBI’s Agent Ronald Hopper of the agency’s Tampa division said at the first news conference. “But right now we can’t say definitively, so we’re still running everything around.”

By the 10:30 news conference, police were saying that they could not yet determine whether it was an act of terrorism or a hate crime. And by 1 p.m., reports based on alleged interviews with the shooter’s family in Port St. Lucie were connecting the attack to a hate crime–that the shooter was motivated by hate for gay people, which may explain why he traveled the 100-mile distance from his home to a well-publicized, highly attended LGBT event in Orlando.

The FBI confirmed that the shooting was carried out by Omar Mateen, of Port St. Lucie, who had twice been interviewed by the FBI, in 2013 and 2014, to follow up on allegations that he’d made statements of sympathy to ISIS. There was no evidence to pursue the case beyond those interviews, the FBI said in a 3:15 p.m. news conference, finding his alleged ties “inconclusive.” He was “not under current investigation at the time of this incident and he was not under surveillance,” Hopper said. He had bought the two firearms involved in today’s shooting within the last few days, officials said. He had been working for an American security firm for nine years–a firm that had contracts with federal government agencies to provide them security.

Speaking to media at about 11:45 a.m., U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said: “I asked the FBI if there was any connection to Islamic radicalism. There appears to be. But they are naturally cautious and waiting throughout to see if this is [as] the facts emerge. I have checked with intelligence staff and they do believe that there is some connection to ISIS, but I might say this is not official. I asked the FBI what I should convey, and because of the nature of this shooting, they have asked me to ask anybody that knows anything about the shooter, especially in the Ft. Pierce St. Lucie area, to please come forth with the information. This appears to be, unfortunately, since it’s the largest mass shooting, an act of terrorism. But the facts, we can’t say that totally yet.”

Nelson was in Orlando, near the scene of the massacre. He does not appear to have been informed about the potential motivations of the shooter’s hatred for gay people, though hatred for gays–and violence toward gays–and Islamist fanaticism are not necessarily mutually exclusive: Islamist regimes such as the Taliban or Iran and terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS have notorious records of brutality and atrocities toward gay, lesbian and transgender people, wherever they’ve held sway. But so far officials and analysts have stressed that there is no evidence of more than possible “sympathizing” between the Orlando shooter and Islamists–and even that link has not been confirmed, though officials have also reported that he made a phone call before the shooting pledging his allegiance to ISIS.

Hours after the attacks, the New York Times reported, “the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacre, in a statement released over an encrypted phone app used by the group, stating that the attack ‘was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,’ according to a transcript provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist propaganda.” CNN, however, said it was not ISIS itself that took direct responsibility, but an Arab news agency citing a source and attributing the attack to ISIS.

None of the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the United States since 9/11 have been carried out by affiliates of either ISIS or al-Qaeda, but rather by lone wolves inspired by the organizations. (The holy month of Ramadan began on June 5.)

At 1:40 p.m., KABC, the ABC affiliate in Los Angeles, was reporting that authorities took a suspect in custody in Santa Monica “after discovering an arsenal in his car that included tannerite powder, assault weapons and a camouflage outfit.” The man was taken in after a traffic stop. “Officers found five pounds of tannerite-type powder, assault weapons, long rifles, clips loaded and taped together and a camouflage outfit along with a security badge.” The Los Angeles mayor said that incident is unrelated to the attack in Orlando.

NBC News reported that it had contacted the man it said is the shooter’s father, who told NBC: “We are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren’t aware of any action he was taking. We are in shock, like the whole country.” His son, he said, was “angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami a couple months ago.”

Around 9:20 a.m., CBS News and ABC News identified the attacker as Omar Mateen, 27, a U.S. citizen and resident of Port St. Lucie. He is a 2001 graduate of Spectrum High School who earned his associates degree in 2006. The assailant’s vehicle has been located near the nightclub. Television stations were showing live images of a robot, used in situations involving potential bombs, processing the vehicle around 9:45 a.m. The FBI’s Hopper told media in a 10:25 a.m. news conference that the agency had confirmed the identity of the shooter, but was not yet releasing it officially pending notification to next-of-kin.

A marriage certificate filed with the St. Lucie Clerk of Court lists Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, born Nov. 16, 1986 in New York, as having married Sitora Alisherzoda Yusufiy, now 27, a Port St. Lucie resident who was born in Uzbekistan. The marriage took place on March 31, 2009. He was employed as a security guard for federal properties and was licensed to cart weapons.

“Federal, state and local law enforcement are at what may be the home of the assailant in the Orlando mass shooting early Sunday, according to law enforcement officials,” St. Lucie County’s TCPalm website was reporting at mid-morning. “They are at a home in the 2500 block of South 17th Street, Fort Pierce, said police spokesman Ed Cunningham.” The home is registered to a Omar Mateen. Property records indicate Mateen owns the property at 2513 S 17th St., #107.

According to police, the shooting began inside the club, where a law enforcement officer, working security at the club off duty, attempted to confront the gunman. There was a brief confrontation outside the club before the gunman returned inside and took more than two dozen hostages. Police Chief John Mina said in a brief news conference this morning that law enforcement decided to rescue the hostages at about 5 a.m., triggering a “controlled explosion” in the process. One law enforcement officer was injured.

Police say there is no reason to believe that there is any additional threat to the Orlando area. People who’d been at the club during the shooting and who survived were bused to Orlando police headquarters for interviews.

“There was some communication” with the gunman before the gunman went back into the club, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at the 10:30 news conference, “but we’re not going to release that right now.” He added, referring to police at the scene in the early part of the confrontation: “Once the initial shots were stopped, they were dealing with a hostage situation. So in that time, we need to set up, reevaluate, reassess what’s happening, and make sure that all the pieces are in place, we have enough staffing to take care of the situation, we have armored vehicles to come to the scene, and those were crucial in the rescue of those hostages.”

Referring to the tally of victims, Mina said, “Just based on what the initial officers saw, without jeopardizing any more safety, they thought there were about at least 20, but now it’s up to 50, so definitely one of the worst tragedies.” He said there was an initial shooting at 2:02 a.m., “numerous shots fired, and then there were gunshots exchanged between the SWAT team and the suspect at 0500 hours,” that is, 5 a.m. But it’s not known, he said, when the majority of the victims were killed.

The 10:30 news conference also featured Imam Muhammad Musri, who leads the Islamic Society of Central Florida and is the national president of American Islam, underscoring the growing likelihood that the shooter is a Muslim, though officials at the news conference did not make reference to ties to Islamist terrorism. “I’m here today to stand as a faith leader with our law enforcement community and our city leadership in this hour of horror that was brought upon our city,” Musri said, praising law enforcement and urging members of all faith to help where they can in the investigation. “No one could have predicted this, no one could have prepared for it. This could have happened anywhere,” he said, adding: “I want to also caution many in the media from rushing into judgment, and from sensationalizing the story, because we do not want the story to be shifted from the focus where it is. It’s a horrible tragedy. We are mourning. We are sad. We are heartbroken. And it’s not really time for any sensational news and rushing to judgment.”

“I was there,” Ricardo Negron Almodovar said on the club’s Facebook page around 3 a.m., as the gunman was still in the club. “Shooter opened fire @ around 2:00am. People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran. I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well.” He said he never had a look at the shooter. “My eyes were on the floor and as soon as there was a break, people started running out the back, including myself.”

“My daughter is in there. Please keep praying for them,” Lilbia Carmen said as the attack was unfolding. “She’s waiting for cops to be able to come out. I was on the [phone] and all I hear is shot guns.” Two hours later, she posted: “She’s out. Thanks so much for your prayers towards my princess and myself! My life is back!!! Thank you God for hearing our prayers!”

Martha Bonilla wrote: “Sadly my cousin was in their and has been shot I pray he makes it praying for him. For those that made it out I’m happy that you are all ok.. My thoughts and prayers are with all of [you].” Erickseon Robledo wrote: “My friend is there. He almost got shot. He is ok. But he just told me that there could be over 20 dead people. He even help people to get out while they were bleeding.”

It is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States, nealry doubling the death toll of the October 1991 shooting in Killeen Texas, when 27 people were killed. Florida had not known a mass-shooting since June 18, 1990, when James E. Pough, upset that his car had been repossessed, murdered seven employees and a customer at a General Motors office, a day after he had killed a man and a woman elsewhere.

But Sunday’s shooting is evoking unnerving memories of the last mass shooting at a nightclub: the Friday, Nov. 13 assault on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, where 90 people were killed by ISIS-inspired French-born terrorists as part of a larger operation targeting several areas of the city. Authorities in Orlando, however, were quick to reassure residents that Sunday’s attack was limited to Pulse. The venue is one of the largest and most popular gay clubs in Central Florida, and the attack, coincidentally or purposely, took place in the midst of Gay Pride Month.

“This is some shitty news to hear after going to Pride,” Douglas Gonzalez wrote. “My thoughts are with the victims and hope all the victims make a speedy recovery. And rest in piece to any of the people who died from this horrible attack. THIS is what us the LGBT community have fought all our lives and will continue to fight against! And to the religious assholes saying ‘doing God’s work,’ how fucking dare you! This is why we must teach people to sympathize and more importantly empathize with others!

At least 50 people were killed and more than 50 others were wounded when a gunman opened fire and took hostages at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning.

The shooter, identified by several law enforcement sources as Omar Mateen, 29, was killed in a shootout with law enforcement after a three-hour siege.

The massacre — the worst mass shooting in the history of the United States — began when the gunman stormed the Pulse Nightclub about 2 a.m. ET with a handgun and a Sig Sauer MCX, an AR-15-style rifle, officials said.
• The gunman called 911 before the attack, expressing fealty to ISIS. He twice had been investigated by federally authorities for alleged comments he made about terrorism, but both investigations were closed.
• The names of the first victims identified in the shooting include seven men between the ages of 20 and 36 years old.
• Mateen had security and firearm licenses and the gunman's weapons were legally purchased within the past week.
• President Barack Obama called the attack ""an act of terror and hate.""

The carnage ended about 5 a.m. ET, when 11 Orlando police officers and three Orange County sheriff's deputies stormed the nightclub and exchanged fire with Mateen, authorities said. City officials said about 300 people were in the club at the time of the shooting.

FBI evidence specialists arrived Sunday night at Mateen's home in a condominium that had been evacuated shortly after dawn, authorities told NBC News. They took their time in case Mateen's unit might be booby-trapped, but authorities said late Sunday that no devices were found, and residents were allowed back home about midnight.

Seddique Mir Mateen, Mateen's father, told NBC News that ""this has nothing to do with religion"" in spite of reports that his son had declared his allegiance to ISIS.

A law enforcement official told NBC News there is no indication that Omar Mateen was in touch with terrorists overseas and nothing to indicate this was a directed attack. Also, several officials say, there's no sign that anyone else was involved in the attack, either in helping Mateen or egging him on.

The father said his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thought that might be related to the shooting.

""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock, like the whole country,"" Seddique Mir Mateen said.

Law enforcement sources told NBC News that Omar Mateen was born in New York in 1986 and was listed as living in Fort Pierce, about 125 miles south of Orlando on Florida's Atlantic coast. Mateen had active security officer and firearm licenses, according to Florida records, and his family said he worked in security.

The FBI first looked into Mateen in 2013 because of a statement he had made about radical Islamic propaganda, law enforcement officials told NBC News. Ron Hopper, an assistant FBI special agent in charge of Orlando operations, said the investigation began after Mateen made offensive comments to co-workers. He was interviewed twice, but the investigation was closed after the FBI wasn't able to confirm that he had ties to radical Islam, Hopper said.

The FBI interviewed him again in 2014 when it learned that he might have a connection to a U.S. suicide bomber, but the investigation was closed because the FBI determined that ""contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship,"" Hopper said.

Law enforcement officials told NBC News that Mateen swore allegiance to the leader of ISIS in a 911 phone call shortly before the shooting, in which he also mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

Mateen legally bought the two guns used in the shooting in the past week, said Trevor Velinor, an assistant special agent in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Tampa.

Marriage records show he was married in Port St. Lucie in 2009, and his family said he had a 3-year-old son.

Police said that Mateen was a U.S. citizen but some of his family members aren't. They wouldn't say where those family members were from.

Meanwhile, a man who answered the phone at Mateen's address, Mustafa Abasin, told NBC News: ""We are in shock, and we are sad."" He wouldn't say how he knew Mateen, but he said he was helping investigators.

Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, whose district includes the area of the massacre, said the attack was ""more likely than not ideologically motivated.""

""It's no coincidence that the attack took place where it did and when it did,"" Grayson said. ""It might be that we've seen the commission of an awful hate crime.""

Grayson said investigators were searching Mateen's home and combing the nightclub. Processing the gruesome scene would ""take hours,"" Grayson said, adding: ""There is blood everywhere.""

The first victims were identified Sunday afternoon. Officials said more names would be released as family members of the dead were notified.

""We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured,"" Rasha Mubarak, Orlando regional coordinator for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement. ""The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence.""

President Barack Obama said Sunday afternoon that the massacre is ""a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub.""

""And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be,"" Obama said. ""And to actively do nothing is a decision, as well.""

""This is an especially heartbreaking day for our friends fellow Americans who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,"" Obama said, calling the attack ""an act of terror and an act of hate.""

Obama said the FBI was leading the investigation.

Police initially said about 20 people were dead, but Orlando Police Chief John Mina said that once authorities were able to get into the club, many more victims were discovered. Mina called the attack ""one of the worst tragedies we've seen.""

Mina said a uniformed officer working extra duty initially traded gunfire with the shooter, who officials say was armed with at least two firearms.

""The officer engaged in a gun battle with that suspect. The suspect at some point went back inside the club, and more shots were fired. This did turn into a hostage situation,"" Mina said.

Officials decided ""to go in on a rescue"" just after 5 a.m. Mina said, adding that an officer was injured after being shot in the head.

""It appears his helmet saved his life,"" he said. ""So he has an injury to his eye, but it looks like the bullet did hit his helmet.""

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the incident ""could definitely be classified as domestic terrorism.""

Florida Gov. Rick Scott traveled to Orlando on Sunday morning and declared a state of emergency in the city.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, families and all those affected by this horrific tragedy. We are a strong and resilient state and we will devote every resource available to assist with the shooting in Orlando,"" Scott said in a statement.

Police also had previously reported on Twitter that there was a ""controlled explosion"" at the scene. Mina later clarified that the noise was caused by a device intended to distract the shooter. Several officials told NBC News that, despite earlier concerns, Mateen did not have any explosives with him. Some bomb-sniffing dogs had alerted earlier, but nothing was found.

Revelers described scenes of horror inside the club. One witness told MSNBC that they had to crawl over bodies to escape.

A post to the club's Facebook page about 2 a.m. warned ""everyone get out of Pulse and keep running."" Witness video from outside showed dozens of first responders at the scene and several victims on the ground.

""It was tragic,"" club-goer Christopher Hansen said. ""I wasn't sure if it was the music, because ... it went with the beat almost until you heard just too many shots.""

""It was just like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang — and that's when you just know chaos is just — it was in turmoil,"" he added.

Mina Justice was outside the club trying to contact her 30-year-old son, Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other patrons to hide. He then texted her: ""He's coming.""

""The next text said: 'He has us, and he's in here with us,'"" she told The Associated Press. ""That was the last conversation.""

Witness Anthony Torres posted to Facebook that he and his friends made it out of the club ""just barely as we started to hear fire being shot.""

""They are just pulling people out in stretchers loading them up,"" he said, referring to first responders. ""Omg please god let everyone make it.""

""People are screaming that people are dead,"" Torres wrote in another post.

The shooting at the nightclub comes during a series of national celebrations that mark LGBT Pride Month.

Barbara Poma, the owner of Pulse, said in a statement Sunday that she was ""devastated.""

""Pulse, and the men and women who work there, have been my family for nearly 15 years,"" Poma said. ""From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community. I want to express my profound sadness and condolences to all who have lost loved ones. Please know that my grief and heart are with you.""","At least 50 people are dead and more than 50 others are wounded after a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, early Sunday morning."

At least 50 people were killed and more than 50 others were wounded when a gunman opened fire and took hostages at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning.

Seddique Mir Mateen, Mateen's father, told NBC News that ""this has nothing to do with religion"" in spite of reports that his son had declared his allegiance to ISIS.

A law enforcement official told NBC News there is no indication that Omar Mateen was in touch with terrorists overseas and nothing to indicate this was a directed attack. Also, several officials say, there's no sign that anyone else was involved in the attack, either in helping Mateen or egging him on.

The father said his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thought that might be related to the shooting.

""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock, like the whole country,"" Seddique Mir Mateen said.

Law enforcement sources told NBC News that Omar Mateen was born in New York in 1986 and was listed as living in Fort Pierce, about 125 miles south of Orlando on Florida's Atlantic coast. Mateen had active security officer and firearm licenses, according to Florida records, and his family said he worked in security.

The FBI first looked into Mateen in 2013 because of a statement he had made about radical Islamic propaganda, law enforcement officials told NBC News. Ron Hopper, an assistant FBI special agent in charge of Orlando operations, said the investigation began after Mateen made offensive comments to co-workers. He was interviewed twice, but the investigation was closed after the FBI wasn't able to confirm that he had ties to radical Islam, Hopper said.

The FBI interviewed him again in 2014 when it learned that he might have a connection to a U.S. suicide bomber, but the investigation was closed because the FBI determined that ""contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship,"" Hopper said.

Law enforcement officials told NBC News that Mateen swore allegiance to the leader of ISIS in a 911 phone call shortly before the shooting, in which he also mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

Mateen legally bought the two guns used in the shooting in the past week, said Trevor Velinor, an assistant special agent in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Tampa.

Marriage records show he was married in Port St. Lucie in 2009, and his family said he had a 3-year-old son.

Police said that Mateen was a U.S. citizen but some of his family members aren't. They wouldn't say where those family members were from.

Meanwhile, a man who answered the phone at Mateen's address, Mustafa Abasin, told NBC News: ""We are in shock, and we are sad."" He wouldn't say how he knew Mateen, but he said he was helping investigators.

Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, whose district includes the area of the massacre, said the attack was ""more likely than not ideologically motivated.""

""It's no coincidence that the attack took place where it did and when it did,"" Grayson said. ""It might be that we've seen the commission of an awful hate crime.""

Grayson said investigators were searching Mateen's home and combing the nightclub. Processing the gruesome scene would ""take hours,"" Grayson said, adding: ""There is blood everywhere.""

The first victims were identified Sunday afternoon. Officials said more names would be released as family members of the dead were notified.

""We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured,"" Rasha Mubarak, Orlando regional coordinator for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement. ""The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence.""

President Barack Obama said Sunday afternoon that the massacre is ""a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub.""

""And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be,"" Obama said. ""And to actively do nothing is a decision, as well.""

""This is an especially heartbreaking day for our friends fellow Americans who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,"" Obama said, calling the attack ""an act of terror and an act of hate.""

Obama said the FBI was leading the investigation.

Police initially said about 20 people were dead, but Orlando Police Chief John Mina said that once authorities were able to get into the club, many more victims were discovered. Mina called the attack ""one of the worst tragedies we've seen.""

Mina said a uniformed officer working extra duty initially traded gunfire with the shooter, who officials say was armed with at least two firearms.

""The officer engaged in a gun battle with that suspect. The suspect at some point went back inside the club, and more shots were fired. This did turn into a hostage situation,"" Mina said.

Officials decided ""to go in on a rescue"" just after 5 a.m. Mina said, adding that an officer was injured after being shot in the head.

""It appears his helmet saved his life,"" he said. ""So he has an injury to his eye, but it looks like the bullet did hit his helmet.""

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the incident ""could definitely be classified as domestic terrorism.""

Florida Gov. Rick Scott traveled to Orlando on Sunday morning and declared a state of emergency in the city.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, families and all those affected by this horrific tragedy. We are a strong and resilient state and we will devote every resource available to assist with the shooting in Orlando,"" Scott said in a statement.

Police also had previously reported on Twitter that there was a ""controlled explosion"" at the scene. Mina later clarified that the noise was caused by a device intended to distract the shooter. Several officials told NBC News that, despite earlier concerns, Mateen did not have any explosives with him. Some bomb-sniffing dogs had alerted earlier, but nothing was found.

Revelers described scenes of horror inside the club. One witness told MSNBC that they had to crawl over bodies to escape.

A post to the club's Facebook page about 2 a.m. warned ""everyone get out of Pulse and keep running."" Witness video from outside showed dozens of first responders at the scene and several victims on the ground.

""It was tragic,"" club-goer Christopher Hansen said. ""I wasn't sure if it was the music, because ... it went with the beat almost until you heard just too many shots.""

""It was just like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang — and that's when you just know chaos is just — it was in turmoil,"" he added.

Mina Justice was outside the club trying to contact her 30-year-old son, Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other patrons to hide. He then texted her: ""He's coming.""

""The next text said: 'He has us, and he's in here with us,'"" she told The Associated Press. ""That was the last conversation.""

Witness Anthony Torres posted to Facebook that he and his friends made it out of the club ""just barely as we started to hear fire being shot.""

""They are just pulling people out in stretchers loading them up,"" he said, referring to first responders. ""Omg please god let everyone make it.""

""People are screaming that people are dead,"" Torres wrote in another post.

The shooting at the nightclub comes during a series of national celebrations that mark LGBT Pride Month.

Barbara Poma, the owner of Pulse, said in a statement Sunday that she was ""devastated.""

""Pulse, and the men and women who work there, have been my family for nearly 15 years,"" Poma said. ""From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community. I want to express my profound sadness and condolences to all who have lost loved ones.

At least 50 people were killed and more than 50 others were wounded when a gunman opened fire and took hostages at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning.

The shooter, identified by several law enforcement sources as Omar Mateen, 29, was killed in a shootout with law enforcement after a three-hour siege.

The massacre — the worst mass shooting in the history of the United States — began when the gunman stormed the Pulse Nightclub about 2 a.m. ET with a handgun and a Sig Sauer MCX, an AR-15-style rifle, officials said.
• The gunman called 911 before the attack, expressing fealty to ISIS. He twice had been investigated by federally authorities for alleged comments he made about terrorism, but both investigations were closed.
• The names of the first victims identified in the shooting include seven men between the ages of 20 and 36 years old.
• Mateen had security and firearm licenses and the gunman's weapons were legally purchased within the past week.
• President Barack Obama called the attack ""an act of terror and hate.""

The carnage ended about 5 a.m. ET, when 11 Orlando police officers and three Orange County sheriff's deputies stormed the nightclub and exchanged fire with Mateen, authorities said. City officials said about 300 people were in the club at the time of the shooting.

FBI evidence specialists arrived Sunday night at Mateen's home in a condominium that had been evacuated shortly after dawn, authorities told NBC News. They took their time in case Mateen's unit might be booby-trapped, but authorities said late Sunday that no devices were found, and residents were allowed back home about midnight.

Oh, I guess if hes a US citizen then theres nothing to see here. Move along ... Now, now, was not the San Ber-do Shooter an U.S. Citizen? Me thinks he was... I bet there is an recent Muslim assistant to be named... 



No, no if he is a citizen then it’s “domestic”. You know the new kind of redneck that faces East to pray while using a confederate flag as his prayer mat. On the weekends he enjoys attending Trump rallies, cross burnings, collecting guns and ammo and, did I mention, attending Trump rallies. 



US Citizen born here with 



An intolerant Democrat from the religion of peace shoots up bunch of Democrat from the LGBT community. Predictable reaction blaming the gun and not the hatred and intolerance of this radical jihadist a-hole to follow from Obama and the left. No mention will be made that this sub-human piece of garbage was a Democrat... Anywhere. May his 72 virgins be a bunch of gay dudes... Now that would be irony. 



It’s so much bigger than that. The islam problem is not any US person’s fault. They’re saying this guy was a citizen, possibly came in under Hussein. But the fact that we have to kick all of them out (or worse) is something not even Trump would handle. So in essence it’s all our faults for not having the balls to get rid of them entirely. What has to happen is they are removed from here and their native lands mass nuked or ramp up the VX production. Anything else is immoral and makes us just as much at fault as Hussein or Hillary. 



Omar Mateen. Why that's a name as American as apple pie. Other outlets reporting that his parents were from Afghanistan. For most of U.S. history, immigration was seen in terms of people, mostly from Europe, coming here to seek a better life in the ""new world."" These people would by and large integrate into U.S. society and contribute to the betterment of United States. While they brought some of the old culture with them, they considered themselves American first and they were welcomed. We are seeing a different kind of immigration lately. Many immigrants now hate America and they want to come here to change it. Not only are they not interested in our culture but they don't even want to speak our language. They want to avail themselves of our generous social services and welfare but they don't want to contribute. In fact, their long term aim is to destroy us. And yet we keep letting them in.",

FBI reviewing past investigations of Orlando gunman to see if they missed clues FBI agents scrambled Monday to recover data from Mateen’s electronic media — cellphones, computers and other devices, hoping to find clues as to what sparked the massacre and whether he has contacts with any known extremists, according to current and former FBI officials. This phase of the investigation — a deep dive into Mateen’s planning, contacts, communications and other evidence — will take at least a few weeks. The FBI is also combing records associated with their last two investigations of Mateen to see if they missed important clues. Both investigations, in 2013 and 2014, were closed after agents determined he had no associations with terrorism. FBI agents questioned Mateen twice in 2013 after being told his co-workers at a security company suspected he might have ties to terrorists. His co-workers said that Mateen had made frightening claims that he had ties to terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, a U.S. law enforcement official said. FBI agents closed that investigation after concluding that Mateen didn’t understand how Al Qaeda operated and had not committed a crime. He told investigators he had been lying and blustering about his terrorist ties. Director James B. Comey told reporters last October that the FBI had conducted more than 900 terrorism investigations, although only a fraction had uncovered active plots. About 90 people had been charged with terror-related crimes. In April, Comey said that the pace had fallen somewhat. He said the number of Americans offering support to Islamic State or seeking to travel abroad to join the group had dropped from six to 10 individuals a month in early 2015 to about one a month. Most terrorism investigations are closed after agents conclude that tipsters were wrong or were seeking to harm someone else’s reputation, such as a former spouse. In the 2013 investigation, Mateen was placed on the FBI’s terrorist screening database, which the FBI describes on its website as “a single database of identifying information about those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity.” A suspect on the database is not barred from boarding a plane or purchasing a weapon. The list serves instead as a clearinghouse for federal and state law enforcement agencies to share information and keep track of potential threats. Mateen was removed from that database after the bureau closed its investigation into him. In 2014, agents again questioned Mateen after learning he had attended the same mosque as Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, an American who later joined Islamic State and was killed in Syria. The FBI conducted an intensive investigation into Abu-Salha, a Florida resident, because he was the first American known to have carried out a suicide bombing for Islamic State. The investigation into Mateen’s relationship with Abu-Salha revealed that the two men likely knew each other by sight but were not friends and likely barely acquaintances, an official said. The FBI “determined that contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time,” Ronald Hopper, an FBI official, told reporters in Orlando. James McJunkin, a former top FBI counter-terrorism official, said the bureau will closely examine how it conducted that investigation because it might show gaps that could have pointed to a more careful vetting of Mateen. Even if faults are found in that investigation, McJunkin said, people can radicalize over time and Mateen may have been a very different person in 2014 than he was in recent weeks. “You are asking the FBI to have a crystal ball that this guy was going to go in and buy an AR-15 and cause all this carnage,” McJunkin said. “There is no way any agency can be expected to do to leave no holes in a free society.” “These guys don’t start off as hardened jihadis,” he added.","Forty-nine people are dead and at least 53 injured in the deadliest shooting in American history after Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old U.S. citizen, opened fire and took hostages inside the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

The Canadian company, Mont Saint-Sauveur International Inc. in Quebec, had raised the money through an EB-5 offering to make improvements at Jay Peak. The federal EB-5 program offers a path to citizenship for foreign nationals who invest $500,000 in projects in the United States that create jobs in depressed regions of the country.

Quiros negotiated the sale between Mont Saint-Sauveur and his Q Resorts over six months from January through June 2008, closing the deal on June 23 for $25.7 million.

In a document filed in federal court in Miami, where Quiros and his former partner, Newport resident Bill Stenger are facing fraud allegations, the SEC says Mont Saint-Sauveur representatives wrote a letter on June 18, 2008, explaining that the $21.9 million being transferred to Q Resorts as part of the sale were EB-5 investor funds.

""The letter further stated the investor money ... could not be used in any way to pay for Q Resorts' purchase of Jay Peak,"" the SEC writes.

The Canadians could not have been any more clear. To no avail, according to the SEC.

""Despite the fact that (Mont Saint-Sauveur International) clearly explained to Quiros and Stenger they could not use investor money to purchase Jay Peak, Quiros — aided by transfers that Stenger made — did exactly that,"" the SEC states. ""Over the next two months Quiros, through Q Resorts, used $21.9 million of investor funds ... to fund the vast majority of his purchase of Jay Peak.""

In an interview with the Burlington Free Press on Saturday, Bill Stenger denied knowing the investor funds were being used to purchase Jay Peak.

""The transfers were made as part of the start-up and creation of a new company,"" Stenger said.

Ariel Quiros could not be reached for comment on Saturday.

Bill Stenger had worked for Mont Saint-Sauveur since 1984, managing Jay Peak, and the $21.9 million in investor funds was being held in escrow accounts at People's United Bank, where Stenger was a signatory on all accounts, according to the SEC.

In preparation for the closing of the sale of Jay Peak, Ariel Quiros asked representatives of Mont Saint-Sauveur to open brokerage accounts at Raymond James in Florida with Quiros' former son-in-law. The Canadians agreed and Stenger opened the accounts, according to the court document.

The SEC points out in its court filing that the agreements with the EB-5 investors stipulated their money could only be put into FDIC-insured bank accounts, and as a brokerage firm, Raymond James was not a bank, and was not FDIC-insured. But eight days after he opened the first escrow account, the SEC alleges Stenger signed an amendment to the agreement as general partner, removing the requirement of an FDIC-insured bank account.

""This cleared the way for the transfer of investor funds to Raymond James accounts,"" the court document states.

Stenger failed to amend a second investor agreement removing the requirement for FDIC backing, yet later transferred $75 million raised from 150 investors into Quiros' Raymond James account, violating the terms of that agreement, according to the SEC.

Worse still, according to the SEC, Stenger gave up control of the money transferred to Quiros' accounts in Florida.

""Stenger had no signatory or other authority over the Raymond James accounts,"" the court document states. ""Rather, Quiros opened all of the Raymond James accounts, and had sole authority over them. Once the Raymond James accounts received transfers from the People's Bank accounts, it was solely Quiros who directed use of the funds.""

The SEC alleges that Stenger, as the ""sole principal"" of the partnerships formed with the foreign investors, ""knew he was supposed to control investor funds.""

""Yet he willingly allowed Quiros to take control of the funds, abdicating the responsibilities clearly laid out for him in the limited partnership agreements,"" the court document states.

Stenger told the Free Press his focus was on the construction and creation of the Hotel Jay, Penthouse Suites, water park and ice arena at Jay Peak, all of which were completed and ""properly built.""

""I was not paying attention to the funding because I had no reason to believe it was not being used properly,"" Stenger said.

Officers said in a Twitter message that there were ""multiple injuries"" at the Pulse nightclub and local media reported that between seven and 20 people had been shot.

The dance club urged patrons to ""get out"" and ""keep running"" in a post on its Facebook page.

According to the police chief John Mina, an Orlando police officer engaged in a gun battle with the suspect. Many people have been killed and about 42 people were taken to hospital. Mina described the shooting as a ""domestic terrorism"" incident. Law enforcement are investigating whether the shooter was a ""lone wolf,"" or if there were more gunmen.

Several patrons had posted on social media that a gunman was holed up inside and holding hostages. One man who said he was inside the club posted that the shooting broke out around 2 am and that he heard about 40 shots being fired.

Javer Antonetti, 53, told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper that he was near the back of the dance club when he heard the gunfire.



""There were so many (shots), at least 40,"" he said. ""I saw two guys and it was constant, like 'pow, pow, pow,'.""

Police said they had carried out a ""controlled explosion"" at the club hours after the shooting broke out, but did not say why that was done. They described the scene as a ""fluid situation.""

Video posted online showed a large number of police and emergency vehicles outside the nightclub. Bomb sniffing dogs were also on the scene, CNN reported.

• Clinton calls for ""statesmanship, not partisanship"" after Orlando

Politicians were quick to offer their somber support for people in Orlando.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton personally took to Twitter to weigh in on the ""devastating news"" from Florida early Sunday morning.

After more information of the shooting came out, Clinton issued another statement some hours later, declaring the murders ""an act of terror"" and ""also an act of hate.""

""For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home,"" she said. The former secretary of state specifically commented on the attack of an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month.

""To the LGBT community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them. We will keep fighting for your right to live freely, openly and without fear. Hate has absolutely no place in America,"" she said.

She concluded her statement with a call for stricter gun control reforms, saying the incident ""reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.""

According to a campaign press release, Clinton's June 15 campaign event in Green Bay, Wisconsin will be postponed. President Obama was scheduled to attend.

Donald Trump, the Republican party's presumptive nominee, also commented on the ""really bad shooting"" via the social media platform.

A few hours later, Trump sent another message on Twitter asking, ""When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?'

And in another message, Trump touted the ""congrats"" he had received for ""being right on radical Islamic terrorism.""



Just minutes before President Obama was scheduled to address reporters from the White House regarding the Orlando shooting, Trump once again fired off another critical tweet:

Trump also tweeted out unconfirmed reports of the shooter declaring ""Allah hu Akbar"" as he opened fire on the nightclub.



In a longer statement sent out by his campaign Sunday afternoon, Trump repeated his call for the president to step down, slamming the chief executive for having ""disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam.'"" He called on Clinton to get out of the general election race for the same reason.

""Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen - and it is only going to get worse,"" he said. ""I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.""

Trump further implied that he would decrease immigration from the Middle East because ""since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.""

""Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term,"" he charged. ""And we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.""

Trump further tweeted that he ""called"" the attack and ""asked for the ban"" of any Muslims entering the U.S.

The suspected shooter, Omar S. Mateen, was an American citizen born in New York to Afghan parents, according to the FBI.

Responding to Trump, Clinton's communication director slammed the billionaire in her own statement Sunday evening.

""Donald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes and self-congratulations,"" Jennifer Palmieri wrote of his response to the Orlando shooting. ""Trump has offered no real plans to keep our nation safe and no outreach to the Americans targeted, just insults and attacks. In times of crisis more than ever, Americans are looking for leadership and deserve better.""

Speaking to NBC's ""Meet the Press"" early Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders called the murders ""horrific"" and ""unthinkable.""

""Our -- just -- hopes go out to all those who were shot that they can recover,"" Sanders said, before discussing his previous support for bans on selling automatic firearms in the U.S.

""Twenty-five years ago, I believed that in this country that we should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people,"" the Vermont senator added. ""We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of those who should not have them: criminals, people who are mentally ill. So that struggle continues.""

Gary Johnson, the Libertarian party's presidential nominee and a former governor of New Mexico, called the slaughter ""both cowardly and infuriating"" but warned against politicizing the situation.

""In this immediate aftermath of what is clearly a tragic and despicable attack, our thoughts must be with the victims. Regardless of what the motivation is ultimately found to be, this violence against innocent people simply going about their lives is both cowardly and infuriating,"" Johnson said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. ""We must allow the authorities to do their jobs, understand how this attack came about, and then respond accordingly. It is not a time to either politicize or jump to conclusions.""

The Orlando shooter put up a protracted gun battle with police, according to a U.S. intelligence source. He was heavily armed with an assault rifle, a handgun, and a ""device"" of some kind that officials believed was a threat.

President Obama was briefed Sunday morning by Lisa Monaco, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism top homeland security officials, according to a statement from the White House press secretary. The president requested to receive regular updates on the situation as the FBI, the Orlando police, and other federal officials continue to carry out their investigation.

Appearing from the White House Sunday afternoon, the president addressed reporters on the shooting.

""This was an act of terror and an act of hate,"" Mr. Obama said. ""The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism."" He acknowledged that it was an ""especially heartbreaking day"" for the LGBT community.

Of the suspected shooter, the president said that ""what is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred."" Mr. Obama named the Orlando massacre as ""the most deadly shooting in American history"" and noted that the killer was armed with at least two guns. He said the day further served as a reminder ""of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on"" a weapon.

He also seemed to chastise legislators for their inability to agree on passing stricter gun reforms.

""We have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be -- and to actively do nothing is a decision as well,"" Mr. Obama said.

The president issued a proclamation Sunday for the American flag to be flow at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds (including military posts, naval stations, U.S. embassies and facilities abroad) until sunset of June 16.

Vice President Joe Biden was also briefed Sunday by his national security advisor.

In a statement from the vice president's spokesperson, Biden ""offered his prayers for all those killed and injured in the shooting and sends his condolences to all the families and loved ones of the victims.""

In a statement from the vice president himself, Biden offered his own prayers and condolences for the Orlando shooting victims but noted that ""our prayers are not enough to end these kinds of senseless mass shootings.""

""The violence is not normal,"" he said, ""and the targeting of our lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans is evil and abhorrent.""

He is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to receive regular updates as well. The vice president, who was scheduled to attend a fundraiser for Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz in Miami Sunday, will instead head to Washington, D.C.

Other local politicians offered up their own prayers for the families of the shooting victims, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who pledged to ""devote every resource available"" to assist.

The Republican governor declared a state of emergency later in the day.

In an extended statement, Scott commented on the ""act of terror.""

""This is a time of great tragedy, and in every tragedy, there is a flood of sadness, confusion and despair,"" he said. ""But, this is an attack on our people. An attack on Orlando. An attack on Florida. An attack on America. An attack on all of us.""

He also issued a warning against those who may try to commit other mass acts of violence: ""To the people who did this or may be thinking about doing something similar: you don't want to commit an act of terror in our state. In Florida, our justice system is swift and our penalties are severe. We are at a 45-year crime low and proud to be a safe state for our 20 million residents and 100 million tourists.""

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, once a candidate for president, tweeted out his own call for central Florida residents to donate blood after several dozens were rushed to local hospitals.

Rubio, who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released a fuller statement later in the day discussing the threat of domestic terrorism.

""Confronting the threat of violent homegrown ‎radicalization is one of the greatest counterterrorism challenges our law enforcement and intelligence community faces,"" he said. ""‎We must do more at every level of government and within our own communities to identify and mitigate this cancer on our free society and prevent further loss of innocent life.""","Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton speak out, after terror incident in Florida; Obama, Biden, other politicians respond"

An investigation is ongoing into the reason for the rampage, and authorities are looking into the possibility that it is terrorism-related.
• Clinton calls for ""statesmanship, not partisanship"" after Orlando

Politicians were quick to offer their somber support for people in Orlando.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton personally took to Twitter to weigh in on the ""devastating news"" from Florida early Sunday morning.

After more information of the shooting came out, Clinton issued another statement some hours later, declaring the murders ""an act of terror"" and ""also an act of hate.""

""For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home,"" she said. The former secretary of state specifically commented on the attack of an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month.

""To the LGBT community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them. We will keep fighting for your right to live freely, openly and without fear. Hate has absolutely no place in America,"" she said.

She concluded her statement with a call for stricter gun control reforms, saying the incident ""reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.""

According to a campaign press release, Clinton's June 15 campaign event in Green Bay, Wisconsin will be postponed. President Obama was scheduled to attend.

Donald Trump, the Republican party's presumptive nominee, also commented on the ""really bad shooting"" via the social media platform.

A few hours later, Trump sent another message on Twitter asking, ""When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?'

And in another message, Trump touted the ""congrats"" he had received for ""being right on radical Islamic terrorism.""



Just minutes before President Obama was scheduled to address reporters from the White House regarding the Orlando shooting, Trump once again fired off another critical tweet:

Trump also tweeted out unconfirmed reports of the shooter declaring ""Allah hu Akbar"" as he opened fire on the nightclub.



In a longer statement sent out by his campaign Sunday afternoon, Trump repeated his call for the president to step down, slamming the chief executive for having ""disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam.'"" He called on Clinton to get out of the general election race for the same reason.

""Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen - and it is only going to get worse,"" he said. ""I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.""

Trump further implied that he would decrease immigration from the Middle East because ""since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.""

""Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term,"" he charged. ""And we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.""

Trump further tweeted that he ""called"" the attack and ""asked for the ban"" of any Muslims entering the U.S.

The suspected shooter, Omar S. Mateen, was an American citizen born in New York to Afghan parents, according to the FBI.

Responding to Trump, Clinton's communication director slammed the billionaire in her own statement Sunday evening.

""Donald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes and self-congratulations,"" Jennifer Palmieri wrote of his response to the Orlando shooting. ""Trump has offered no real plans to keep our nation safe and no outreach to the Americans targeted, just insults and attacks. In times of crisis more than ever, Americans are looking for leadership and deserve better.""

Speaking to NBC's ""Meet the Press"" early Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders called the murders ""horrific"" and ""unthinkable.""

""Our -- just -- hopes go out to all those who were shot that they can recover,"" Sanders said, before discussing his previous support for bans on selling automatic firearms in the U.S.

""Twenty-five years ago, I believed that in this country that we should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people,"" the Vermont senator added. ""We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of those who should not have them: criminals, people who are mentally ill. So that struggle continues.""

Gary Johnson, the Libertarian party's presidential nominee and a former governor of New Mexico, called the slaughter ""both cowardly and infuriating"" but warned against politicizing the situation.

""In this immediate aftermath of what is clearly a tragic and despicable attack, our thoughts must be with the victims. Regardless of what the motivation is ultimately found to be, this violence against innocent people simply going about their lives is both cowardly and infuriating,"" Johnson said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. ""We must allow the authorities to do their jobs, understand how this attack came about, and then respond accordingly. It is not a time to either politicize or jump to conclusions.""

The gunman, who reportedly used an assault rifle and handgun in what appeared to be a planned attack, wounded 42 others in the rampage and took hostages before being killed in a firefight with SWAT forces.

The shooting is being investigated as an act of terrorism, the Associated Press reports:

Police Chief John Mina also said the shooter had some sort of ""suspicious device."" He said the suspect exchanged gunfire with an officer working at the club around 2 a.m., then went back inside and took hostages. Around 5 a.m., authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the hostages, and the suspect then died in a gunfight with those officers. Mina said police have not determined an exact number of casualties, but that ""approximately 20"" people were dead inside the club. Florida Department of Law Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Danny Banks said during a news conference that the mass shooting is being investigated as an act of terrorism. He says authorities are looking into whether this was an act of domestic or international terror, and if the shooter was a lone wolf.

The Democratic National Committee held two days of open hearings this week in Washington, D.C., on the platform, inviting experts to testify. The hearings, which will also take place in other cities, got underway the same week that it became clear that Clinton had secured her position as the party’s presumptive presidential nominee.

Much of the back and forth Thursday afternoon, when the committee considered foreign policy, was about whether the committee should describe Israel’s presence in the West Bank as an “occupation.”

Sanders, the Independent senator from Vermont who remains in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, appointed five members to the 15-member committee, including three who have advocated for Palestinian rights in the past: Cornel West, a philosopher who backs for the boycott Israel movement; James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute, and Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn. Clinton appointed six committee members.

West said during the hearing that the party’s platform should include the word “occupation,” suggesting that to do otherwise would mean being “beholden” to American Israel Public Affairs Committee. AIPAC staffers were in the room, as were staffers from other pro-Israel groups, including J Street.

Sanders, the first Jewish candidate to win major party nominating contests, said last month that he wanted Palestinian rights reflected in the platform. The most recent platform, from 2012, advocates for a two-state solution, but casts it in terms of preserving Israel’s security.

Howard Berman, a former congressman from California with extensive foreign affairs experience, who is one of four appointees by the DNC chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said listing the grievances of both sides would bog down the platform. “I could come up with a list, if we want this platform to get into it, of issues of (Palestinian) incitement,” he said.

Robert Wexler, a former Florida congressman who appeared before the committee as an expert witness representing Clinton’s views, said that to include the word “occupation” would prejudge the outcome of negotiations, which is not the role of the party.

Zogby countered that the 2012 platform says that “Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel,” a statement that also prejudges the outcome of negotiations.

Wexler told JTA in an interview after the hearing that introducing “occupation” to the platform would be inflammatory. “To insert language with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that is inflammatory and that prejudges items that are to be negotiated at the negotiating table, the Democratic platform is not the place to do that,” Wexler, the president of the Center for Middle East Peace, said.

The drafting committee’s platform will be presented to the full committee during the convention in late July in Philadelphia. Party officials are eager not to repeat the scene in 2012, when the full platform committee, under fire by pro-Israel groups for not including Jerusalem in the original draft, voted to add recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. The motion passed, but there was loud booing during the session.

Wendy Sherman, a Clinton appointee who is a former deputy secretary of state, counseled against exacerbating intra-party disagreements on the issue, arguing that the platform should focus on distinguishing Democrats from Republicans, who have retreated from two-state advocacy.

“Only a two-state solution can provide Palestinian sovereignty and dignity and provide Israelis with the secure and recognized borders of a Jewish democratic state,” she said during the hearing. “Our differences are really with the Republican party in how we prosecute peace.”

Matt Duss, the director of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, appearing as an expert witness, said failure to recognize the occupation as such ran counter to American values.

“We must recognize that Israel’s continued occupation of Palestinian territories and its daily restrictions on the most basic political and civil liberties of the Palestinian people run contrary to fundamental American values,” he said.

Wexler, in his interview after testifying, said that while the platform could be tweaked, Clinton’s views – which he said included not prejudging the outcome by referencing an “occupation” – would prevail because she is the nominee.

“There was a winner of the Democratic primaries and her name is Hillary Clinton, and Hillary Clinton has a decades long policy regarding Israel,” he said.

Wexler in his testimony also said that the platform should reject bids to delegitimate Israel, including through the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.","WASHINGTON — The Democratic Party’s platform drafting committee tussled over whether to use the word “occupation” in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian issue, reflecting divisions between the Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton camps that could play out at the convention.

— -- Politicians are weighing in on news of the deadly terror attack in a Florida nightclub early this morning.

President Obama was briefed on the ""tragic shooting,"" according to the White House.

Other politicians started responding when it was first believed that there were 20 fatalities, but officials have now reported that at least 50 people were killed and 53 others were treated for injuries.

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was the first candidate to tweet about the incident, which officials have called an ""act of terror,"" though it remains unclear if it was a domestic or international terror attack.

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also tweeted her thoughts, signing the message with an ""-H"" which is used to denote tweets she writes herself.

Sen. Bernie Sanders called the shooting ""horrific"" and ""unthinkable"" during an appearance on ""Meet the Press.""

""We have got to do everything that we can to prevent guns from falling into the hands of people who should not have them,"" Sanders said.

Rep. Alan Grayson, whose district includes the area of Orlando where the shooting occurred, offered his thoughts for the victims.

""Words cannot express the horror, pain and sadness that we feel about this terrible loss. I commend the Orlando police for their heroic efforts to save the lives of those who could be saved,"" Grayson said in a statement.

Other Florida politicians also tried communicating with their constituents, including both Gov. Rick Scott and Sen. Marco Rubio who tweeted their prayers. Scott said that the state would ""devote every resource available to assist"" and Rubio called for action.

On ABC News' “This Week,” Terry DeCarlo, the executive director for GLBT Center of Central Florida, said that it remains unclear whether the club was targeted specifically because it is a gay nightclub.

“There’s a lot of traumatized people here right now. We have mobilized our center, we’ve thrown open our doors. We have counselors heading there right now,” he said.

“This is just a tragic situation, we’re trying to find out exactly what’s going on and wrap our heads around how something like this could possibly happen,“ DeCarlo said.

“It is an LGBT nightclub, it’s one of the largest LGBT nightclubs here in Orlando. We cannot say that it was a specific hit on an LGBT nightclub right at the present time. The police are working on that,” DeCarlo added.

Pope Francis weighed in on the massacre, issuing a statement by Holy See press officer Father Federico Lombardi.

""The terrible massacre that has taken place in Orlando, with its dreadfully high number of innocent victims, has caused in Pope Francis, and in all of us, the deepest feelings of horror and condemnation, of pain and turmoil before this new manifestation of homicidal folly and senseless hatred,"" the statement reads.

Here’s what we know,"Around 50 people were killed and at least 53 wounded this morning (June 12) when a gunman opened fire in a popular gay nightclub in downtown Orlando. Mayor Buddy Dyer announced the casualties, higher than the 20 deaths originally reported, at a press conference this morning and said he’s asked Governor Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency. The death toll makes the shooting the worst in US history, police said. The Virginia Tech shooting in 2007 killed 32.

The Islamic State news agency has issued a statement saying they’re responsible for the attack, Florida Senator Bill Nelson said at a press conference. The connection to Islamic State has not been confirmed, and Nelson said it remains a possibility that Mateen was a lone wolf, but that authorities will be investigating links to Islamic State.

The FBI said in a press conference that Mateen had been known to authorities since 2013, and the FBI had interviewed him twice. He was not under current investigation or surveillance.

Before carrying out the attack, Mateen reportedly called 911 in Florida and swore his allegiance to the head of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Law enforcement officers have also said Mateen was known to authorities before he carried out the attack.

Officials classified the shooting as a “terror incident.” They said the shooter was “organized and well-prepared,” had an AR-15 assault rifle and handgun, and was not from Orlando. Police chief John Mina also said the shooter had a “suspicious device.” The shooter has been identified as Omar S. Mateen, law enforcement sources have told CBS News. Mateen, a U.S. citizen from Port St. Lucie, was born to Afghan parents in 1986. He worked as a professional security officer and had a license to carry a firearm. The AR-15 semi-automatic rifle Mateen was found with was also used in the Sandy Hook and San Bernardino shootings.

President Obama, speaking at the White House this morning, said that the investigation is ongoing. “We know enough to say this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” he said. “We are still learning all the facts.”

Obama said “the most deadly shooting in American history” is a further reminder of how easy it is to buy weapons and commit shootings at “schools, houses of worship, movie theaters, and nightclubs.” He added that, “We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

The President said that that shooting is an attack on America, and a “heartbreaking day for all of our fellow Americans who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.” He added that, “The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub. It’s a place of solidarity and empowerment.”

Florida congressman Alan Grayson said that it was “more likely than not” that the attack was ideological, and that it was “no coincidence” the attack took place at a gay club. Asked whether Mateen had any help, Grayson said there was “no evidence of that at this point.” Officials have said they’re still determining whether this was a hate crime or an act of terrorism.

Mir Seddique, Mateen’s father told NBC News, “this has nothing to do with religion.” Seddique said his son saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and became angry. He believes that this may be related to the shooting.

When asked about any links between the shooter and radical Islam, an FBI official said there were “suggestions” the gunman “might have leanings towards that particular ideology,” but it was too early to confirm anything. Orange County sheriff Jerry Demings called the shooting a “domestic terrorism incident.”

The gunman entered the Pulse nightclub, which was filled with more than 300 people for a “Latin Night” event, and began shooting at around 2am. He exchanged fire with a police officer working at the club, before taking hostages in a back room. Three hours later, police set off a “controlled explosion” to distract Mateen and sent in a SWAT team. Mateen was killed in a shootout with officers. Police have since ensured that the club is free of any devices are working to identify victims in the nightclub. The FBI has said there is “no information to suggest there is any further threat” to other areas of the city.

Jon Alamo, who was inside the club, told AP news agency “I heard 20, 40, 50 shots. The music stopped.” A bouncer knocked down a partition between the club area and an area in the back where only workers are allowed, allowing those inside to escape through the back of the club.",This story was updated at 2:14pm ET

At least 20 people are dead and 42 injured in an attack on a nightclub in Orlando, Florida:

About 20 people were killed and at least 42 people were wounded when a gunman armed with an assault rifle and a handgun opened fire inside a downtown Orlando nightclub about 2 a.m., Police Chief John Mina said. The police said they had classified the attack as a “terror incident.” The gunman was not from the Orlando area and was organized and well-prepared, they said. The gunman was found dead inside the Pulse nightclub, one of the largest in Orlando, about 5 a.m. after a shootout with the police, Chief Mina said. The chief said it was difficult to assess the number of clubgoers who were killed because, as of 7:15 a.m., many of the bodies had not been removed. The shooting began inside the club, the chief said, and continued outside when an officer working at Pulse attempted to confront him. The gunman then went back into the club, resumed shooting and took hostages. At 5 a.m., Chief Mina said, the police decided to rescue the hostages, detonating a “controlled explosion” to help clear the club. At least nine officers were involved in the shooting with the gunman. One of them was slightly injured, the authorities said. The police called it a “mass casualty” event. The wounded were taken to three area hospitals. The police also said the gunman was carrying a “device,” and that officers were searching the club for possible explosives. On its Twitter feed, the Police Department asked residents to “stay away from area” and said that it was seeking support from local state and federal agencies. Later, employees in the area were asked to stay home if possible. The club itself posted a message on its Facebook page about 3 a.m.: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.” Customers streamed out of the club into a chaotic situation with little idea of where to go. “Cops were saying, ‘Go, go, clear the area,’ ” Christopher Hansen told an Orlando television station. “You don’t know who’s what and who’s where.” As the sun came up, helicopter-shot video showed a situation that seemed to be under control, although windows on one side of the club appeared to be shot out. Phone camera videos shot at the scene show police cars, ambulances and other emergency vehicles outside the club on South Orange Avenue in downtown Orlando. Streets around the the club were shut down for several blocks. In one video, shots could clearly be heard as men and women ran from Pulse. Some of the clubgoers told local television reporters that the music was so loud it was difficult, at first, to distinguish the shots from the pulsing beat. More than 100 people were believed inside the club when the shooting began about 2 a.m. Many of the wounded were taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, about three blocks from the club, which was placed on lockdown after receiving several gunshot victims. “Only essential workers are being allowed access into the building,” the hospital said in a statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, Arnold Palmer Hospital and Winnie Palmer Hospital have also been placed on lockdown,” the statement added. On Pulse’s Facebook page, club officials promised to post updates as they came in: “As soon as we have any information, we will update everyone.” “Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event,” the nightclub post0 said. “Thank you for your thoughts and love.”

More from the Orlando Sentinel:

Twenty people are dead at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in what investigators are calling an act of terrorism, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at a morning news conference. A gunman took scores of people hostage overnight inside the nightclub; about 42 people were taken to area hospitals, Mina said. Officers killed the gunman, who has not been identified, in a shoot out and referred to him as a “lone wolf.” He was carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and was possibly wearing an explosive ”device.” The Orange County Sheriff’s Office hazardous device team is now searching the area. About 30 people were “saved during the rescue,” Mina said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting. Agents say they cannot rule this out as an act of domestic terrorism and that the suspect, who is not from Orlando, may have leanings toward extreme Islamic ideologies. Dozens of emergency vehicles surrounded the chaotic scene at the club at 1912 S. Orange Ave. after the 2 a.m. shooting and rescue squads were transporting multiple victims to area hospitals. Some victims were transported to Orlando Health, which established a family information center early this morning, asking family members to go to at 52 West Underwood St. Several family members stood outside the North entrance of ORMC awaiting news. A relative of one victim, who did not want her name used, said she got a call at 3 a.m. about the shooting. Her friend and the friend’s brother-in-law were at the club. “He got shot twice and he’s in there, but we don’t know anything about her. So we’re just waiting here.” Florida Hospital wouldn’t confirm if any patients have been transported there this morning, but said they can check on names for families. Witnesses said they heard at least 40 shots fired inside the club and estimated that at least 20 people had been shot. Police reported just before 6 a.m. that the shooter inside the club was dead. Mina said his officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect in two shootings. Nine officers were involved in the shooting and one sustained an injury to his head and was saved by his helmet. The Orlando Fire Department called for its bomb squad and hazardous material team to the scene after 3 a.m. Police K-9 dogs are searching the area around nearby Orlando Regional Medical Center with an armed deputy in head-to-toe military gear. Emergency workers were seen taking victims away from the scene in large trucks–in one case, an emergency worker was doing chest compressions on one of the victims. Just after the shooting, Pulse Orlando’s posted a note to its own page that said, “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.” The popular gay bar was full of people at the time of the incident. Emotional witnesses and family members of those who were in the club surrounded the area around the club after the shooting, that one witness said lasted the duration of an entire song. Javer Antonetti, 53, went out to the club with his brother. He was towards the back of the room when he heard shots ring out. ”There were so many, at least 40,” he said. “I saw two guys and it was constant, like ‘pow, pow, pow,’ ” he said. He said he ran out of the club. His brother is on crutches and was stuck inside. Antonetti said authorities were able to help save his brother, who he says is uninjured but still near the club. ”I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “Police told me he’s safe but he’s still stuck back there.” He’s waiting near Orlando Regional Medical Center. Antonetti noticed when he made it out safe that he has blood smears on his shirt. He said he doesn’t know how they got there and didn’t see how many were injured. Another witness, Rosie Feba, said she took her girlfriend to the club for the first time Saturday night. It was near closing time. “She told me someone was shooting. Everyone was getting on the floor,” Feba said. “I told her I didn’t think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.” Feba and her girlfriend ran out of the club. On the way out, they saw a man who had been shot. Feba grabbed him. Others around her called 911. Some of the man’s blood stained the sleeve of her striped T-shirt. Both Feba and her girlfriend were unharmed, but shaken. They waited in a CVS parking lot for more information.

Obviously, at this early stage of the investigation, mere hours after the hostage situation at the club had ended, it’s far too early to say exactly what kind of attack actually occurred over night. The fact that the attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism is, to a large degree, a procedural step that allows the Federal Bureau Of Investigation to step in and take over the investigation. It may turns out that the shooter in this case, who at least for now appears to have acted alone, was not motivated by a political or religious ideology but rather by a personal vendetta of some kind such as in the case of the countless work place shootings that we have seen over the years, or by some other personal situation. Given the fact that the nightclub in this case was known to cater predominantly to Orlando’s gay and lesbian community, it may be that this was an attack specifically targeting the LGBT community or that it was motivated by some perverted political motivation related to gay rights. Finally, of course, it may well be the case that the shooter in this case was motivated by jihadist terrorism in which case the next question would be whether he (or she, although the police seem to be indicating the shooter was male without specifically saying so as of yet) was acting alone or after having made contact with international terrorist groups of one kind or another. The answers to all of these questions will be revealed in the coming hours and days, presumably.

What we do know is that the shooter, apparently acting alone, arrived at the club shortly before closing time when the remaining patrons were ordering their final drinks or otherwise preparing to leave. Given that the club was described as being ‘packed’ at the time shooting started, this suggests that the shooter had planned to take advantage of the confusion of a large crowd already making its way toward the exits in order to inflict mass casualties, although that’s mere speculation at this point. We know that the shooter was carrying a rifle, a handgun, and was found with some kind of ‘device,’ which police are still investigating. And, we know that there was a hostage situation inside the club that lasted roughly three hours before police stormed the club and killed the gunman. A crime and terrorism analyst on CNN this morning suggested that the fact that the shooteer hunkered down for a three hour standoff suggests that this may not have been jihadist inspired terrorism, the unspoken truth being that both the shooters at the Bataclan in Paris and in San Bernardino took steps to kill as many people as possible rather than taking hostages and making demands, That’s just speculation at this point, though, and we won’t really know anything until the shooter is identified and we know more about their motivations. Beyond all of this, we know that 50 people are dead and more than 40 are being treated for injuries related to the shooting, and that’s it.

Update: CBS News is reporting, and The Washington Post and NBC News have seemingly confirmed, the identity of the shooter as Omar Mateen, a 29 year-old American citizen from from Port St. Lucie, Florida. CBS is also reporting that authorities are ”leaning towards Islamic terrorism” as the motivation for the attack.

Update #2: Authorities are now reporting that there are 50 people dead, and 53 injured. That would make this the worst mass shooting in American history, surpassing even the Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook shootings:

I have updated the post title accordingly.

Update #3: From NBC Nightly News, comes the report that Mateen apparently called 911 to pledge loyalty to ISIS prior to the attack, as well as other news about what may have motivated the attack on this specific target:

The gunman who opened fire at a gay Florida nightclub early Sunday, shooting over 100 people, had called 911 moments before to pledge allegiance to the leader of ISIS, law enforcement sources told NBC News. But as investigators try to determine if extremism motivated Omar Mateen, 29, to attack the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, his family believes he was pushed over the edge by pure hate against the LGBT community. Various law enforcement officials have identified the shooter as Mateen, who was born in New York and lived in Port St. Lucie on Florida’s eastern shores. The attack, which claimed at least 50 lives, is considered the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. While authorities are still investigating what motivated the gunman, the shooting is being considered an act of terrorism. Mateen, who was carrying a handgun and AR-15-type rifle, died after a SWAT team stormed the club, police said. The shooter, who worked in security, according to the family, had active security officer and firearms licenses, records show. Records also show he had filed a petition for a name change in 2006 from Omar Mir Seddique to Omar Mir Seddique Mateen. Because of his name and heritage, there were immediate questions about Mateen’s possible ties to Islamic fundamentalism — but his father said it may have been a recent incident involving two men showing each other affection that set the gunman off. “We were in Downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music. And he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry,” Mir Seddique, told NBC News on Sunday. “They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said, ‘Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that.’ And then we were in the men’s bathroom and men were kissing each other.” “We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident,” Seddique said. “We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.” Seddique added, “This had nothing to do with religion.” Driving the point home that religion was a consideration in the mind of investigators, at a 10:30 a.m. news conference Saturday, officials brought a member of the Muslim community to speak. Police did not explicitly say Mateen was Muslim, but Islamic groups put out statements against the carnage. “We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,” the Council on American-Islamic Relations Orlando Regional Coordinator Rasha Mubarak said in a statement.

It’s also being reported that Mateen was “known” to the FBI and other Federal authorities, but apparently was not under any form of active surveillance prior to the attack.

Update #4: President Obama addressed the nation from the Briefing Room this afternoon:

Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder — a horrific massacre — of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city. Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people. I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisors. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I’ve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation. We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We’ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us. This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need — they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come. We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm’s way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It’s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough. This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends — our fellow Americans — who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub — it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans. Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well. In the coming hours and days, we’ll learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families — that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more — as a country — by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us. As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts — friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us. May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love. Thank you.","An overnight shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida has left 20 people dead and at least 42 injured."

What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us. This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need — they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come. We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm’s way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It’s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough. This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends — our fellow Americans — who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub — it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans. Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well. In the coming hours and days, we’ll learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families — that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more — as a country — by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us. As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts — friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us. May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love. Thank you.","An overnight shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida has left 20 people dead and at least 42 injured."

At least 20 people are dead and 42 injured in an attack on a nightclub in Orlando, Florida:

About 20 people were killed and at least 42 people were wounded when a gunman armed with an assault rifle and a handgun opened fire inside a downtown Orlando nightclub about 2 a.m., Police Chief John Mina said. The police said they had classified the attack as a “terror incident.” The gunman was not from the Orlando area and was organized and well-prepared, they said. The gunman was found dead inside the Pulse nightclub, one of the largest in Orlando, about 5 a.m. after a shootout with the police, Chief Mina said. The chief said it was difficult to assess the number of clubgoers who were killed because, as of 7:15 a.m., many of the bodies had not been removed. The shooting began inside the club, the chief said, and continued outside when an officer working at Pulse attempted to confront him. The gunman then went back into the club, resumed shooting and took hostages. At 5 a.m., Chief Mina said, the police decided to rescue the hostages, detonating a “controlled explosion” to help clear the club. At least nine officers were involved in the shooting with the gunman. One of them was slightly injured, the authorities said. The police called it a “mass casualty” event. The wounded were taken to three area hospitals. The police also said the gunman was carrying a “device,” and that officers were searching the club for possible explosives. On its Twitter feed, the Police Department asked residents to “stay away from area” and said that it was seeking support from local state and federal agencies. Later, employees in the area were asked to stay home if possible. The club itself posted a message on its Facebook page about 3 a.m.: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.” Customers streamed out of the club into a chaotic situation with little idea of where to go. “Cops were saying, ‘Go, go, clear the area,’ ” Christopher Hansen told an Orlando television station. “You don’t know who’s what and who’s where.” As the sun came up, helicopter-shot video showed a situation that seemed to be under control, although windows on one side of the club appeared to be shot out. Phone camera videos shot at the scene show police cars, ambulances and other emergency vehicles outside the club on South Orange Avenue in downtown Orlando. Streets around the the club were shut down for several blocks. In one video, shots could clearly be heard as men and women ran from Pulse. Some of the clubgoers told local television reporters that the music was so loud it was difficult, at first, to distinguish the shots from the pulsing beat. More than 100 people were believed inside the club when the shooting began about 2 a.m. Many of the wounded were taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, about three blocks from the club, which was placed on lockdown after receiving several gunshot victims. “Only essential workers are being allowed access into the building,” the hospital said in a statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, Arnold Palmer Hospital and Winnie Palmer Hospital have also been placed on lockdown,” the statement added. On Pulse’s Facebook page, club officials promised to post updates as they came in: “As soon as we have any information, we will update everyone.” “Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event,” the nightclub post0 said. “Thank you for your thoughts and love.”

More from the Orlando Sentinel:

Twenty people are dead at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in what investigators are calling an act of terrorism, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at a morning news conference. A gunman took scores of people hostage overnight inside the nightclub; about 42 people were taken to area hospitals, Mina said. Officers killed the gunman, who has not been identified, in a shoot out and referred to him as a “lone wolf.” He was carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and was possibly wearing an explosive ”device.” The Orange County Sheriff’s Office hazardous device team is now searching the area. About 30 people were “saved during the rescue,” Mina said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is assisting. Agents say they cannot rule this out as an act of domestic terrorism and that the suspect, who is not from Orlando, may have leanings toward extreme Islamic ideologies. Dozens of emergency vehicles surrounded the chaotic scene at the club at 1912 S. Orange Ave. after the 2 a.m. shooting and rescue squads were transporting multiple victims to area hospitals. Some victims were transported to Orlando Health, which established a family information center early this morning, asking family members to go to at 52 West Underwood St. Several family members stood outside the North entrance of ORMC awaiting news. A relative of one victim, who did not want her name used, said she got a call at 3 a.m. about the shooting. Her friend and the friend’s brother-in-law were at the club. “He got shot twice and he’s in there, but we don’t know anything about her. So we’re just waiting here.” Florida Hospital wouldn’t confirm if any patients have been transported there this morning, but said they can check on names for families. Witnesses said they heard at least 40 shots fired inside the club and estimated that at least 20 people had been shot. Police reported just before 6 a.m. that the shooter inside the club was dead. Mina said his officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect in two shootings. Nine officers were involved in the shooting and one sustained an injury to his head and was saved by his helmet. The Orlando Fire Department called for its bomb squad and hazardous material team to the scene after 3 a.m. Police K-9 dogs are searching the area around nearby Orlando Regional Medical Center with an armed deputy in head-to-toe military gear. Emergency workers were seen taking victims away from the scene in large trucks–in one case, an emergency worker was doing chest compressions on one of the victims. Just after the shooting, Pulse Orlando’s posted a note to its own page that said, “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.” The popular gay bar was full of people at the time of the incident. Emotional witnesses and family members of those who were in the club surrounded the area around the club after the shooting, that one witness said lasted the duration of an entire song. Javer Antonetti, 53, went out to the club with his brother. He was towards the back of the room when he heard shots ring out. ”There were so many, at least 40,” he said. “I saw two guys and it was constant, like ‘pow, pow, pow,’ ” he said. He said he ran out of the club. His brother is on crutches and was stuck inside. Antonetti said authorities were able to help save his brother, who he says is uninjured but still near the club. ”I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “Police told me he’s safe but he’s still stuck back there.” He’s waiting near Orlando Regional Medical Center. Antonetti noticed when he made it out safe that he has blood smears on his shirt. He said he doesn’t know how they got there and didn’t see how many were injured. Another witness, Rosie Feba, said she took her girlfriend to the club for the first time Saturday night. It was near closing time. “She told me someone was shooting. Everyone was getting on the floor,” Feba said. “I told her I didn’t think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.” Feba and her girlfriend ran out of the club. On the way out, they saw a man who had been shot. Feba grabbed him. Others around her called 911. Some of the man’s blood stained the sleeve of her striped T-shirt. Both Feba and her girlfriend were unharmed, but shaken. They waited in a CVS parking lot for more information.

Obviously, at this early stage of the investigation, mere hours after the hostage situation at the club had ended, it’s far too early to say exactly what kind of attack actually occurred over night. The fact that the attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism is, to a large degree, a procedural step that allows the Federal Bureau Of Investigation to step in and take over the investigation. It may turns out that the shooter in this case, who at least for now appears to have acted alone, was not motivated by a political or religious ideology but rather by a personal vendetta of some kind such as in the case of the countless work place shootings that we have seen over the years, or by some other personal situation. Given the fact that the nightclub in this case was known to cater predominantly to Orlando’s gay and lesbian community, it may be that this was an attack specifically targeting the LGBT community or that it was motivated by some perverted political motivation related to gay rights. Finally, of course, it may well be the case that the shooter in this case was motivated by jihadist terrorism in which case the next question would be whether he (or she, although the police seem to be indicating the shooter was male without specifically saying so as of yet) was acting alone or after having made contact with international terrorist groups of one kind or another. The answers to all of these questions will be revealed in the coming hours and days, presumably.

What we do know is that the shooter, apparently acting alone, arrived at the club shortly before closing time when the remaining patrons were ordering their final drinks or otherwise preparing to leave. Given that the club was described as being ‘packed’ at the time shooting started, this suggests that the shooter had planned to take advantage of the confusion of a large crowd already making its way toward the exits in order to inflict mass casualties, although that’s mere speculation at this point. We know that the shooter was carrying a rifle, a handgun, and was found with some kind of ‘device,’ which police are still investigating. And, we know that there was a hostage situation inside the club that lasted roughly three hours before police stormed the club and killed the gunman. A crime and terrorism analyst on CNN this morning suggested that the fact that the shooteer hunkered down for a three hour standoff suggests that this may not have been jihadist inspired terrorism, the unspoken truth being that both the shooters at the Bataclan in Paris and in San Bernardino took steps to kill as many people as possible rather than taking hostages and making demands, That’s just speculation at this point, though, and we won’t really know anything until the shooter is identified and we know more about their motivations. Beyond all of this, we know that 50 people are dead and more than 40 are being treated for injuries related to the shooting, and that’s it.

Update: CBS News is reporting, and The Washington Post and NBC News have seemingly confirmed, the identity of the shooter as Omar Mateen, a 29 year-old American citizen from from Port St. Lucie, Florida. CBS is also reporting that authorities are ”leaning towards Islamic terrorism” as the motivation for the attack.

Update #2: Authorities are now reporting that there are 50 people dead, and 53 injured. That would make this the worst mass shooting in American history, surpassing even the Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook shootings:

I have updated the post title accordingly.

Update #3: From NBC Nightly News, comes the report that Mateen apparently called 911 to pledge loyalty to ISIS prior to the attack, as well as other news about what may have motivated the attack on this specific target:

The gunman who opened fire at a gay Florida nightclub early Sunday, shooting over 100 people, had called 911 moments before to pledge allegiance to the leader of ISIS, law enforcement sources told NBC News. But as investigators try to determine if extremism motivated Omar Mateen, 29, to attack the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, his family believes he was pushed over the edge by pure hate against the LGBT community. Various law enforcement officials have identified the shooter as Mateen, who was born in New York and lived in Port St. Lucie on Florida’s eastern shores. The attack, which claimed at least 50 lives, is considered the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. While authorities are still investigating what motivated the gunman, the shooting is being considered an act of terrorism. Mateen, who was carrying a handgun and AR-15-type rifle, died after a SWAT team stormed the club, police said. The shooter, who worked in security, according to the family, had active security officer and firearms licenses, records show. Records also show he had filed a petition for a name change in 2006 from Omar Mir Seddique to Omar Mir Seddique Mateen. Because of his name and heritage, there were immediate questions about Mateen’s possible ties to Islamic fundamentalism — but his father said it may have been a recent incident involving two men showing each other affection that set the gunman off. “We were in Downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music. And he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry,” Mir Seddique, told NBC News on Sunday. “They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said, ‘Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that.’ And then we were in the men’s bathroom and men were kissing each other.” “We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident,” Seddique said. “We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.” Seddique added, “This had nothing to do with religion.” Driving the point home that religion was a consideration in the mind of investigators, at a 10:30 a.m. news conference Saturday, officials brought a member of the Muslim community to speak. Police did not explicitly say Mateen was Muslim, but Islamic groups put out statements against the carnage. “We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,” the Council on American-Islamic Relations Orlando Regional Coordinator Rasha Mubarak said in a statement.

It’s also being reported that Mateen was “known” to the FBI and other Federal authorities, but apparently was not under any form of active surveillance prior to the attack.

Update #4: President Obama addressed the nation from the Briefing Room this afternoon:

Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder — a horrific massacre — of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city. Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people. I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisors. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I’ve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation. We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We’ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us. This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need — they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come. We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm’s way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It’s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough. This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends — our fellow Americans — who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub — it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans. Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well. In the coming hours and days, we’ll learn about the victims of this tragedy.

A gunman opened fire and took hostages at the popular nightclub, Pulse Orlando, at about 2 a.m. before being killed in a gun battle with authorities. The FBI says the attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism.

President Barack Obama was briefed about the shooting early Sunday and has directed federal officials to provide “any necessary assistance to pursue the investigation and support the community,” Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims,” the statement said. Vice President Joe Biden also sent his condolences and is “closely monitoring the situation,” his spokesperson said in a statement.

But as presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders explained to Chuck Todd on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday, the real culprit, according to Sanders, is gun control — or more precisely, lack thereof.

“I believe that in this country, we should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people,” Sanders said, according to an emailed statement from NBC. “We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them, criminals, people who are mentally ill.”

The Vermont senator called the shooting “horrific” and “unthinkable,” adding that he believes there to exist “a very broad consensus in this country” between most, but not all, gun owners who believe “we have got to do everything that we can to prevent guns from falling into the hands of people who should not have them. That means expanding the instant background checks, it means doing away with the gun show loophole, it means addressing the straw man provision.”

Sanders has traditionally taken a less aggressive stance on gun rights than has his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, maintaining that individual states should legislate on the issue but that certain measures should remain in place to keep guns out of the wrong hands. At the time of writing, Sanders was the first and only candidate to have framed the shooting as a problem of gun control.

The shooter has been as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old man from Port St. Lucie, Florida. So far, no information is available on the provenance of the weapons he used. The shooting, which left an estimated 50 people dead and 53 wounded during Pulse’s Upscale Latin Saturday event, comes in the middle of LGBT Pride Month.","Early Sunday morning, a gunman walked into Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and opened fire.

President Obama was briefed on the “tragic shooting,” according to the White House.

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was the first candidate to tweet about the incident, which officials have called an “act of terror,” though it remains unclear if it was a domestic or international terror attack.

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also tweeted her thoughts, signing the message with an “-H” which is used to denote tweets she writes herself.

Rep. Alan Grayson, whose district includes the area of Orlando where the shooting occurred, offered his thoughts for the victims.

“Words cannot express the horror, pain and sadness that we feel about this terrible loss. I commend the Orlando police for their heroic efforts to save the lives of those who could be saved,” Grayson said in a statement.

Approximately 20 people were killed in the shooting, according to the Orlando police chief. The mayor of Orlando told ABC News’ “Good Morning America” that the number is “probably” higher.

On ABC News’ “This Week,” Terry DeCarlo, the executive director for GLBT Center of Central Florida, said that it remains unclear whether the club was targeted specifically because it is a gay nightclub.

“There’s a lot of traumatized people here right now. We have mobilized our center, we’ve thrown open our doors. We have counselors heading there right now,” he said.

Overview

 Forty-nine people are dead and 53 injured after a well-organized and well-prepared gunman opened fire and took hostages inside a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, at about 2 a.m. Sunday morning. (The FBI revised the number of victims down from 50 to 49 Monday.) Authorities are calling the attack, which is the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, an “act of domestic terrorism.” The gunman, identified as 29-year-old U.S. citizen and Florida resident Omar Mateen, was found dead inside the club following a shootout with a police SWAT team at around 5 a.m. He was armed with an AR-15-type assault rifle, handgun, knife, and “some kind of device.” Law enforcement officials have indicated that they suspect the attacker has ties to Islamic extremism, and it has been reported that Mateen made a 911 call and declared his allegiance to ISIS and called the Boston Marathon bombers his “homeboys” prior to the attack. Since the target was a gay nightclub, the attack is also the worst ever attack on the U.S. LGBT community, as well as the deadliest hate crime in modern American history.

The Attack and Aftermath

 About 320 people were inside the Pulse nightclub when the gunman entered the club and started shooting, just before last call around 2 a.m. Witnesses reported hearing as many as 40 shots as they tried to rush to safety, with some crawling away on the floor across broken glass and bottles, and others hiding in a restroom. An off-duty police officer working security at the club initially engaged in a gun battle with the shooter but was apparently unable to stop him. The shooter then opened fire on the crowd. The club, which was hosting its weekly Latin Night, quickly posted a frantic message on their Facebook page warning patrons, “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.” The gunman eventually took about five patrons hostage in a bathroom and holed up inside.

Once police arrived, they apparently established communication with the gunman. Orlando police chief John Mina, at a Monday press briefing, described the shooter as “cool and calm” in his conversations with cops. Mina said no shots were fired, but Mateen brought up his allegiance to ISIS and his admiration for the Tsarnaev brothers, reports the Times. He told police that he had explosives on his person, which prompted law enforcement to act. Those boasts turned out to be false; Mateen only had firearms.

At around 5 a.m., police conducted a raid to rescue the hostages. Officers tried to blow a hole in the wall with explosives. That failed to breach the wall, so they drove an armored vehicle into the building to break through and set the hostages free. Mateen also emerged and was killed in the resulting firefight. Some 30 hostages were rescued at that time, mostly from an isolated room that the killer could not enter, and which police ultimately breached using an armored car.

One SWAT team member was shot in the head during the rescue, but was saved by his Kevlar helmet:

The New York Times has constructed a rough timeline of the attack based on what information has emerged so far. And in this video, compiled by The Guardian, a variety of witnesses describe what the attack and aftermath were like:

In these videos posted via social media, victims can be seen being treated by first responders outside the club, and a barrage of gunfire can be heard, presumably between police and the gunman during the SWAT raid:

By the end, roughly one out of every three people at the club were either injured or killed in the attack.

The Suspected Shooter and His Possible Motivations

 According to the Washington Post and multiple other news organizations, the suspected attacker has been identified “by relatives and law enforcement officials” as 29-year-old Omar Amir Siddiq Mateen, a U.S. citizen who resided roughly 125 miles south of Orlando in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, where he worked for a private security company called G4S. Late Monday night the company released a statement saying Mateen was employed at a gated retirement community and had undergone background checks.

Mateen was born in New York, in 1986, but eventually moved to Florida with his family. His parents had emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan. Mateen’s father, Seddique Mateen, told NBC that, “We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.”

In 2006, Mateen earned an associate’s degree in criminal justice technology from Indian River State College. He had then been working for the G4S private security firm since 2007. Bloomberg reports that G4S is a major U.S. government contractor, particularly with the Department of Homeland Security. About 15 percent of its employees are rescreened every year, though it’s unclear if Mateen was subject to a re-check. Its armed guards, including Mateen, carry weapons on the job and receive firearms training. The weapon he used at work was reportedly not involved in the attack.

Mateen was well-organized and well-prepared for the clearly premeditated attack, and was armed with both an AR-15-type assault weapon, a handgun, and a knife. He wasn’t wearing or carrying an explosive device, despite what he initially told police. Florida records indicate that Mateen was licensed as a security officer in the state, and also had a firearms license. An official at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms announced on Sunday that Mateen had legally purchased two firearms within the last week or so. Authorities believe those were the weapons he used in the attack.

Ed Henson, the owner of the gun shop where the shooter purchased his weapons, said Mateen raised no red flags and passed all his state and federally mandated background checks without incidence. “An evil person came in here, and legally purchased two firearms from us,” Henson said. “If he hadn’t purchased them from us, I’m sure he would have gotten them from another local gun store in the area.” He added that he wished he had “picked no place.”

Nothing is yet known about how the gunman chose his target, but witnesses have come forward to say they’ve seen Mateen at the gay nightclub on multiple occasions — possibly going back years before his deadly attack. The Orlando Sentinel spoke to four club regulars who recognized the gunman from past visits to Pulse:

Another regular, Chris Callen, told the Canadian Press that Mateen had been “going to the bar for at least three years.” They said he came with a friend to drink and let loose. Callen and Smith, who also gave an interview to the Canadian outlet, recalled an incident where Mateen had threatened fellow clubgoers:

Another witness said that Mateen had messaged him on Jack’d, a gay social-networking site, three months ago. “When he first contacted me, he was saying things like, ‘What clubs are popping and things of that sort, what are good places to go?” the man told ABC News. “And I remember telling him, ‘Oh, you can just look it up online because I don’t go out that much.”

Orlando police chief Mina said he had no knowledge of those reports, according to the Sentinel.

CBSN reported that Pulse night club had at least appeared on the killer’s browsing history days before the attack, and the owner of another large gay club in Orlando told the East Orlando Post that he received a Facebook friend request from Mateen last week, which he rejected. He says the FBI is now reviewing his security footage to see if Mateen ever scouted that club. It’s therefore possible Mateen could have also contacted or visited other gay clubs in his search for an ideal target.

At the same time, law-enforcement sources told CBS News that Mateen apparently enrolled in the “Fundamental Islamic Knowledge Seminary,” an online course operated by an imam named Abu Taubuh, also known as Marcus Robertson, who preaches anti-gay sermons.

Mateen allegedly scouted other targets in the Orlando area, specifically Walt Disney World, sources told The Wall Street Journal. The killer visited the resort and theme park, though it’s unclear when he visited, and which specific location he had gone to see.

Regarding Mateen’s motivation for the attack, NBC News reports that law-enforcement officials say Mateen declared his allegiance to the leader of ISIS in a 911 call. He also referred to the Tsarnaev brothers as his “homeboys,” though investigators say there’s no proof he ever had contact with either of the Boston Marathon bombers. Earlier, during a Sunday-morning press conference, an FBI spokesman cautioned that they were investigating multiple leads, but also indicated that, “We do have suspicions that the individual may have leanings toward [a jihadist] ideology.” Florida senator Bill Nelson and Florida representative Adam Schiff have both indicated that law-enforcement officials told them that they believe there is a link between Mateen and ISIS, but Nelson also stressed that such connections remain unconfirmed, as the investigation is ongoing. Indeed, officials have not officially confirmed any link between Mateen and any organized terrorist groups.

There were originally no indications that ISIS or any other terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the attack, and if the gunman was motivated by a jihadist ideology, he also could have been acting as a “lone wolf,” as ISIS has instructed its followers to conduct such attacks. Later on Sunday, an ISIS claim for the attack did emerge, though that doesn’t mean anyone in the organization helped plan the attack, or even knew about it before it happened.

Here is the full statement, published in the New York Times and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group:

ISIS had also recently made their annual call for followers to take advantage of the holy month of Ramadan to conduct attacks.

According to law enforcement sources who spoke with both NBC News and the Daily Beast, Mateen was a “known quantity” to federal authorities, and had previously been investigated for having Islamic extremist views. Per The Guardian, the FBI eventually detailed those investigations in a press conference on Sunday afternoon, with special agent Ron Hopper explaining that:

FBI director James Comey said Mateen told authorities that he made those connections up because he was fed up with his co-workers, “who were were discriminating against him and teasing him because he was Muslim.”

They investigated him again in 2014, after Mateen suggested he had a relationship with American suicide bomber Omar Abu Salah, but the FBI found that “contact was minimal and didn’t to constitute a substantive relationship or threat at that that time.”

Mateen was briefly married, from 2009 to 2011, and in an interview with the Washington Post, his ex-wife said that he was abusive, and did not seem interested in radical Islam. She also questioned his mental health:

She adds that her parents, after they learned of his abuse, came to Florida and pulled her out of the house, and she never spoke to Mateen again. She believes “they literally saved my life.”

One of Mateen’s former co-workers, Daniel Gilroy, told the New York Times he “wasn’t shocked” when he heard about what had happened in Orlando. “I saw it coming,” he said. “He talked about killing people all the time. He was just agitated about everything, always shaken … always mad,” Gilroy said, adding that Mateen was prone to using racial, sexual, and ethnic slurs.

Mateen’s father also indicated to NBC that he believes his son may have been motivated by homophobia, not religious extremism. “This has nothing to do with religion,” he told them. He said Mateen had become enraged after seeing two men kissing in Miami a few months ago, and that he believed that incident may be related to the attack.

With regards to Mateen’s father, the Washington Post notes that he hosts a somewhat incoherent political television show related to Afghan politics, in which he at least once expressed support for the Afghan Taliban:

A state of emergency has been declared in Orlando so that law-enforcement officials can focus on the investigation, according to Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer. Mateen’s residence in Port Saint Lucie was searched by authorities on Sunday morning as was a house belonging to his relatives, also in Port Saint Lucie. Prosecutors said Monday that investigators had conviscated electronic and criminal evidence from the gunman’s residence, and are looking into possible accomplices. “I do want to let you know that we have no reason to believe that anyone connected to this crime is placing the public in imminent danger at this time,” said U.S. Attorney for Central Florida, Lee Bentley III, on Monday. “That there is an investigation of other persons. We’re working as diligently as we can on that. We have teams of prosecutors, as well as teams of agents working around the clock, getting search warrants, getting court orders. If anyone else was involved in this crime, they will be prosecuted.”

To complicate matters, authorities received reports of a potential break-in at Mateen’s condo Monday morning, not long after the FBI had wrapped up their raid. Witnesses noticed that the back sliding door was partially open. The lock had apparently been broken.

Comey, who refused to call the shooter by name, said Monday that no evidence existed at this point to indicate the shooter had direct instructions from a terrorist network to carry out the attack, or that he had even been in contact with ISIS or another radical group. Comey added: “It is also not entirely clear just what terrorist group he aspired to support. Although he made clear his affinity, at the time of the attack for ISIL, and generally, in the time leading up to the attack for radical Islamist groups.

President Obama echoed Comey’s assertions, saying Mateen was likely radicalized by online propaganda. He called it one of the administration’s biggest challenges” in the fight to defeat ISIS. “Countering this extremist ideology is increasingly going to be just as important that we’re disrupting more extensive plots engineered from the outside,” he said.

“It’s not an either-or; it’s a both-and,” Obama continued. “We have to go after these terrorist organizations and hit them hard. We have to counter extremism. We also have to make sure that it is not easy for somebody who decides they want to harm people in this country to be able to obtain weapons.”

The Victims

 Initially, 20 people were reported to have been killed, but the toll was later updated to 50 killed and 53 wounded. On Monday, the FBI said the total number of victims stood at 49. (The original number of 50 dead included the gunman.) That revised total came after authorities were able make sure the club was cleared of potential explosives and safely access the entire building, discovering the additional victims. Most of the victims — 39 people, including the shooter — were found dead inside the club, reports the Times. Authorities found two bodies outside the club, and at least nine people died on the way to the hospital. The updated total makes the attack the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, and it was already the worst-ever attack on the U.S. LGBT community.

The media is beginning to learn more about those killed in the attack, and Orlando authorities have identified almost all of the victims, and notified next of kin for a little more than two dozen of those killed. Officials have begun to release the names of those vicitms. The city of Orlando is posting the names of the dead on its website after the families have been contacted.

The portraits of those murdered are beginning to emerge. Because it was Latin Night at Pulse, many of the victims were Latino. Officials have put out a call for volunteer translators to help contact families of the deceased, many of whom are Spanish speakers. The youngest killed was 19; the oldest 50. They included 22-year-old Luis Vielma, who worked at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, and 34-year-old Edward Sotomayor Jr. who had organized the first-ever gay cruise to Cuba in April. At least one New Yorker died in the attack, a social worker and aspiring nurse, 25-year-old Enrique Rios. One victim, 30-year-old Eddie Jamoldroy Justice, texted his mom that he loved her and was in the bathroom: “He’s coming,” he wrote. “I’m gonna die.”

Orlando health officials said 43 of the 53 hurt in the attack are still hospitalized as of Monday morning. The hospital said five people remain in “grave” condition. With the exception of those people who died en route, none of those admitted to the hospital since have died of their wounds.

The many people injured in the attack were taken to three area hospitals, and there are multiple heartbreaking reports of family members trying to locate their loved ones throughout the morning. Indeed, one of the most harrowing details to emerge after the attack is that law-enforcement investigators said that after they entered the club, they had to tune out the sound of cell phones going off among the dead, presumably as frantic friends and family members tried to call the victims to see if they were okay.

Medical officials asked area residents to donate blood in the wake of the attack (locations to do that can be found here) and the response was overwhelming — though many have pointed out that, despite this attack striking the LGBT community, FDA rules still prohibit gay men from donating blood if they have been sexually active within the past year.

In addition, police have have set up a hotline (407-246-4357) for family members who believe a loved one may be one of the victims. Facebook has also activated its safety-check feature for Orlando-area users. Orlando authorities have also asked the public not to hold any large-scale vigils for a while, as the city’s resources are still stretched too thin following the attack.

But vigils sprung up in other cities, including one outside Stonewall Inn in New York City, which is set to be named a national monument to gay rights.

The Location

 The venue where the attack occurred, the Pulse nightclub, is one of the largest clubs in Orlando, Florida, and caters to the LGBT community. One of the DJs playing Saturday night told the Times, “This is a nice club, decent, people come from all over to dance and have a good time. Young people. A lot of young people were there last night.” A former Pulse dancer who spoke with McClatchy DC explained in more detail:

He added that the only reason there were fewer people in the club when the attack happened on Saturday night was because it was close to closing time and most patrons had already left.

Here is a 2008 video that shows the interior of Pulse:

The Political Response

 Barack Obama addressed the nation on Sunday afternoon regarding the attack, which he called both “an act of terror and an act of hate.” He also highlighted how horrifying it was that the target was a gay club, which he called “a place of solidarity and empowerment” for the LGBT community, and connected the shooting to the larger problem of gun violence in America, adding that:

Vice-President Biden also released a written statement following the tragedy in which he called the shooting “an act of pure hate and unspeakable terror:”

Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have both responded to the tragedy, first on Twitter, and with more substantive statements later on Sunday:

Clinton would later release a larger statement, in which she focused a little more on the terrorism element than Obama had, but still essentially echoed his remarks:

Hillary Clinton gave a national-security speech in Cleveland Monday and called for an “intelligence surge” to help identify lone-wolf attackers.

And as might be expected from someone who called for a ban on Muslim immigrants following the San Bernardino terrorist attack last year, Trump’s comments had a sharper political edge from the start, as he quickly used the attack for a kind of self-gratifying told-you-so moment:

Trump then released a statement regarding the attacks late Sunday afternoon, first trying to suggest that terrorism is a result of political correctness, focusing on how President Obama did not use the term “radical Islam” in his address to the nation (and suggesting he resign because of it):

Trump also defaulted to his larger, de facto Islamophobic argument about how Middle Eastern immigrants, i.e. Muslims, shouldn’t be let into the U.S.:

Monday morning on Fox & Friends, Trump lobbed accusations at Obama for the attack: “People cannot — they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can’t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There’s something going on. It’s inconceivable.” And more was to come.

Trump delivered a speech at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire where he reiterated his “not going to have a country anymore” line unless the United States started adopting some of his suggestions to screen and temporarily ban Muslims. “I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so,” Trump said. “When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.” Here are his remarks:

Several hours after the attacks Ted Cruz also released a statement that echoed Trump’s. “Enough is enough,” he said. “What we need is for every American — Democrat and Republican — to come together, abandon political correctness, and unite in defeating radical Islamic terrorism.” He also warned that the Obama administration — and liberals in general — would “try to exploit this terror attack to undermine the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms of law-abiding Americans.”

The suspected gunman in what is the worst terror attack on US soil since the al-Qaeda attacks of September 11th, 2001, was named as Omar Seddique Mateen (29), a US citizen born in New York to Afghan parents who lived in Fort Pierce, about 120 miles southeast of Orlando, on Florida’s east coast.

US president Barack Obama called the attack on the Pulse nightclub “a horrific massacre” and “an act of terror and an act of hate.

“Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history,” Mr Obama said during a brief statement from the White House in which he again raised concerns about the ease of access to weapons in the United States.

“ The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well,” he said.

The Orlando suspect called 911 before the attack and pledged allegiance to Islamic State, US law enforcement officials quoted by US media said.

He also referenced the brothers who carried out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, a Massachusetts State Police spokesman said.

“He pledged allegiance to Isis and referenced the Tsarnaev brothers,” state police spokesman David Procopio said in an e-mail. The Tsarnaev brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar killed three people and injured more than 260 in the April 15, 2013, attack.

The death toll eclipsed the 32 people killed by a lone gunman, student Seung-Hui Cho, at Virginia Tech university campus in April 2007. Another 53 people were injured in Sunday’s attack.

While investigators were still treating the attack as an act of terrorism, Mr Mateen’s family suggested that the attack by the married father of one may have been a hate crime aimed at the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

The suspect’s father, Mir Seddique told NBC News that his son, who worked as a security guard, became enraged when he saw two men kissing in front of his wife and three-year-old son on a recent trip to Bayside, a popular entertainment area in downtown Miami.

“We are apologising for the whole incident,” Mr Seddique said. “We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.” He added: “This had nothing to do with religion.”

US media reported that Mr Seddique had been investigated previously by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014.

The attack on the nightclub, packed with about 300 patrons at the time in what is LGBT Pride month, began at 2.02am local time (7.02am in Ireland) on Sunday when a police officer working at the club exchanged fire with a gunman who then went inside and took hostages. About three hours later, a SWAT police team raided the club and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who was holed up with hostages in a part of the club, killing him.

Inside, police found scores dead and injured. Dr Mike Cheatham, a trauma surgeon at Orlando Regional Medical Centre, where 46 of the injured were taken, said that most were in critical condition. “I think we will see the death told rise,” he told the Associated Press.

Orlando police chief John Mina said that the gunman used an assault rifle, an AR-17 semi-automatic with large capacity rounds of bullets that has become a signature of US mass shootings, and a handgun.

He also had “some type of device on him.” Police later carried out a controlled explosion on the device. “It appears he was organised and well-prepared,” Mr Mina told reporters.

The suspect's ex-wife told the Washington Post that Mr Seddique was mentally unstable and violent towards her during a two-year marriage that ended in 2011.

“He was not a stable person,” said the woman, who did not want to be named. “He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.”

Relatives of club patrons caught up in the attacked recalled dramatic moments as they found themselves cornered by the suspected gunman. Mina Justice told the Associated Press that her son Eddie texted when the attack began and asked her to contact the police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide and then texted her: “He’s coming.”

“The next text said: ‘He has us and he’s in here with with us,’” she said. “That was the last conversation.” During the attack, the nightclub posted a message on Twitter: “Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running.”

The Irish embassy in Washington DC said it was monitoring developments but hadn’t received any requests for consular assistance.

Hillary Clinton, Democratic nominee for the White House, said she joined Americans in praying for the victims of the attack in Orlando, their families and the first responders who did everything they could to save lives.

“This was an actor of terror.... This was also an act of hate. The gunman attacked an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. To the LGBT community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them. We will keep fighting for your right to live freely, openly and without fear. Hate has absolutely no place in America,” she said.

Her rival, Bernie Sanders, said all Americans were horrified, disgusted and saddened by the horrific atrocity in Orlando.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he was “right on radical Islamic terrorism” and called for toughness and vigilance.

Trump made the statement on Twitter after the attack in Orlando.

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,” he tweeted. “We must be smart.”

President Michael D. Higgins said he wanted to express his sincerest condolences to the families of all those bereaved and affected by the tragedy.

In a statement on Sunday evening he said: “ Our thoughts are with the people of Florida and the community in Orlando and Orange County at this difficult time. The loss of innocent life on such a horrendous scale is truly shocking and challenges us all.”

It was the second deadly shooting at an Orlando night spot in as many nights.

The shooting in Orlando at Pulse, which bills itself as “the hottest gay bar” in the city and was packed with more than 300 people, was reported minutes after 2 a.m. Sunday. In addition to those killed inside the club, at least 42 people were taken to area hospitals. Dozens of party-goers remained hostages in the club for several hours after the initial shooting, prompting SWAT teams to pour inside. Shortly after 6 a.m. local time, Orlando police tweeted that the gunman had been killed.

The gunman, whose identity was not immediately released, “may have leanings” toward radical Islam, FBI Special Agent in Charge Ron Harper said when asked by Fox News whether the suspect had ties to Jihadist terror groups. Harper said the investigation is looking into possible threats made previously by the suspect in connection to radical Islam groups. He said the agency is still investigating and has yet to confirm any role a terror group may have played in the mass shooting.

“There are allegations the individual made threats in the past to having ties to terrorist organizations,” Harper told Fox News.

“At this time we’re looking at all angles right now,” Harper said. “We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings toward [radical Islam], that particular ideology. But right now we can’t say definitively so we’re still running everything around.”

The incident “is being investigated as an act of terrorism,” said Danny Banks, special agent in charge at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, who added that “around 20” people are believed dead inside the nightclub.

Banks said the suspected shooter – who was armed with an “assault-type rifle” and a handgun — also was dead inside the club, where he was shot and killed at around 5 a.m. in a shootout with SWAT team officers who were called in “to rescue hostages,” Chief John Mina of the Orlando Police Department said.

“It appears he was organized and well-prepared,” the chief said, adding that the shooter had an assault-type weapon, a handgun and “some type of (other) device on him.”

On Sunday afternoon, President Barack Obama addressed the nation from the White House, opening by offering condolences to those affected.

“We pray for their families who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando who have endured a terrible attack on their city,” Obama said. “Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. As Americans, we stand are united in grief, in outrage and in resolve to defend our people.”

Obama mentioned nothing about Islamic terrorism, but pointed out that the shooter had access to an assault rifle.

“This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub,” he said. “And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

At least 9 officers were involved in raiding the nightclub, and one officer was injured, according to Banks. The injured officer was hit by a bullet and his Kevlar helmet saved his life, Banks said.

Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer credited law enforcement with saving more lives by their heroic efforts.","50 people are confirmed dead, at least 53 more injured after a mass shooting shortly after 2 a.m. at Pulse, a gay Orlando nightclub. Police investigating shooter's ties to radical Islamic terrorism."

About 20 minutes before the killings, Mateen called 911 to pledge his allegiance to ISIS. He gave his full name to the operator, and mentioned the Boston bombers, according to multiple sources who spoke to law enforcement.

Mateen had purchased a ""long gun"" and a handgun within a week of the Orlando attack, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said. The weapons were purchased legally, despite Mateen being investigated for possible terrorist ties several years ago.

The FBI first became aware of Mateen in 2013, when he made threats to co-workers, ""including possible ties to terrorist activities,"" an FBI spokesman said Sunday.

One of those co-workers, Daniel Gilroy, who worked with Mateen as a security guard, said he ""complained multiple times that he was dangerous."" Mateen showed anger toward black people, gay people, Jewish people and women, Gilroy told the LA Times.

""You meet bigots,"" Gilroy told the publication. ""But he was above and beyond. He was always angry, sweating, just angry at the world.""

Abusalha -- who lived Fort Pierce, Florida, as did Mateen -- was the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. Mateen's contact with Abusalha was deemed ""minimal"" and did not pose a threat at the time, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper.

The gunman's father, Seddique Mateen, said his son grew upset after seeing two gay men kissing. The father later said in a Facebook video that ""God himself will punish those involved in homosexuality,"" The Washington Post reported. He described Mateen as ""a good son.""

""He was not a stable person,"" Sitora Yusifiy, Mateen's ex-wife, told The Washington Post. Their short-lived marriage came to an end after Mateen became abusive toward her and her family had to ""rescue"" her, she said.

Wasserman Shultz's tenure at the DNC has been a major topic of conversation as the primary election season has come to an end, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders reportedly working on her ouster in his negotiations with rival Hillary Clinton's campaign.

In the West Virginia resolution, Wasserman Shultz was criticized for what delegates termed ""dissension and disarray in the Party.""

The resolution noted Wasserman Shultz has overseen the ""worst electoral defeat in decades, ""adding that the party ""has lost more state legislative races than at any time since 1928.""

The Florida congresswoman was dinged for her management of the Democratic primary debate schedule and for ""creating the perception in the public eye of favoring one candidate over others, which results in lowering trust in the Democratic Party.""

West Virginia Democrats also called for either elimination of superdelgates by the 2020 election or linking their votes to the results of state elections.

Pulse, which is one of the biggest nightclubs in Orlando, was holding a Latin-themed event that was nearing its end when a man opened fire. There were more than 300 people inside at the time. ""He had an automatic rifle, so nobody stood a chance,"" said Jackie Smith, who saw two friends next to her get shot. ""I just tried to get out of there."" At 02:09, the nightclub posted on its Facebook page, external: ""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running."" The gunman, who was carrying an AR-15-type assault rifle and a handgun, exchanged fire near the entrance with a police officer who was working at the nightclub. Additional officers arrived at the scene and a second gun battle ensued inside, forcing the gunman back. He took several people hostage in a bathroom at the back of the building, and told the police he had explosives. At this point, police were able ""to save and rescue dozens and dozens of people and get them out of the club,"" according to Orlando police chief John Mina. With the gunman holed up in the bathroom, police secured the building and began preparing to breach the external wall of the bathroom with explosives.

Police chiefs made the decision to storm the building at about 05:00 local time (09:00 GMT), detonating the explosives to create large holes on the building's rear wall. Mr Mina said dozens of people who had taken shelter in another bathroom were able to escape through these holes before the gunman himself emerged. After another gun battle with police, he was shot dead. At least 49 people were killed in the attack, making it the worst mass shooting in recent US history.

Who was the gunman?

FBI Special Agent Ron Hopper told reporters that Mateen had been interviewed by FBI officers twice in 2013 following inflammatory comments to colleagues asserting ties to the so-called Islamic State group (IS). The investigation ended after officers were unable to substantiate the claims. However, Mateen was questioned again in 2014 about a potential connection to Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, an American known to have carried out a suicide bombing in Syria. Mateen's ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, said that he was violent and mentally unstable and had beaten her repeatedly while they were together. It appears that he remarried after that divorce, and had a three-year-old son with his second wife, according to the Miami Herald, external. Investigators are looking at whether his second wife, Noor Zahi Salman, knew about the plot ahead of time, and are considering charges. She told the FBI her husband said he was going to see friends, though she thought he was going to carry out an attack at the night club, officials have told the US media. There are also media reports that she said she was with him when he bought ammunition and a holster, and drove him to Pulse once to scope it out.

Was there an IS link?

The group has said it was behind the attack, but the extent of its involvement is not clear. An FBI spokesman said Mateen phoned emergency services during the attack and pledged allegiance to IS. The group had called for its supporters to launch attacks on the West during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, that began last week. But US President Barack Obama said there was no evidence yet of any contact between the gunman and Islamic State. He said it was an example of ""homegrown extremism"" and it appeared Mateen was inspired by content he saw online.

What have eyewitnesses said?

There were more than 300 people inside the club at the time of the shooting. Some have been speaking about what they witnessed. Jon Alamo said he was at the back of one of the club's rooms when a man holding a weapon entered. ""I heard 20, 40, 50 shots,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""The music stopped."" Rob Rick said the attack happened just as ""everybody was drinking their last sip"". He dropped to the ground and crawled to a DJ booth when he heard shots. Janiel Gonzalez said it was ""complete chaos"" as the gunman opened fire.

""People were screaming 'Help me, help me, I'm trapped!'"" he told AFP. ""People were getting trampled. There was no clear exit sign at the club, so we didn't know which door to take or where to go."" ""All you saw is people running and screaming and there were bodies in the parking lot where bodies were being tagged,"" Christopher Hansen told CNN. ""It was like a scene from a horror movie."" Angel Colon said he was shot three times in the leg and survived the attack.

What is the political reaction?

US President Barack Obama said this was an act of terror and an act of hate, but authorities were investigating whether there were links to extremist groups. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, called on the president to resign for not using the words ""Islamic terrorism"" and once again called for a ban on all Muslims coming to the United States. Mr Obama, visibly angry, said that is ""not the America we want"". ""If we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims with a broad brush and imply that we are at war with an entire religion, then we are doing the terrorists' work for them,"" he said.",At least 49 people are killed and dozens injured by a gunman who opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

You know they’ll be handing out candy and sweets next. 



Officials said the Islamist killer was on their radar. With all those who were ""on the RADAR"", it makes one wonder why they ever turn the RADAR on.... 



Yet NBC law enforcement expert Jim Cavanaugh calls it DOMESTC Terrorism. Well of course it was. The perp was born here, slaughtered here, and is a citizen. It has to be something else that compelled him to terror. Hmmmm, what could it be? Was he a member of some violent cult? Did he read any green book with directions to violence? Did he express sympathy to any people or groups that were also violent? Whatever could be that ""thing"", that commonality that they share I wonder. 



This proves Trump is right and makes Hillary and Obama look like lying traitors. The media will be working overtime trying to come up with a way to blame this on Trump's ""hateful rhetoric"" towards Muslims.",

Officials said the Islamist killer was on their radar.

An ISIS twitter account posted this photo Sunday morning. (Is this the killer?)



You know they’ll be handing out candy and sweets next. 



Officials said the Islamist killer was on their radar. With all those who were ""on the RADAR"", it makes one wonder why they ever turn the RADAR on.... 



Yet NBC law enforcement expert Jim Cavanaugh calls it DOMESTC Terrorism. Well of course it was. The perp was born here, slaughtered here, and is a citizen. It has to be something else that compelled him to terror. Hmmmm, what could it be? Was he a member of some violent cult? Did he read any green book with directions to violence? Did he express sympathy to any people or groups that were also violent? Whatever could be that ""thing"", that commonality that they share I wonder. 



This proves Trump is right and makes Hillary and Obama look like lying traitors. The media will be working overtime trying to come up with a way to blame this on Trump's ""hateful rhetoric"" towards Muslims.",

ISIS made a major declaration three days ago that it was targeting Florida.



Shoebat.com reported on the threat three days ago.

 ISIS Muslim terrorists released a statement on their plan to attack Florida, and even put out a list with the names of people in Florida that they plan on killing. According to one report:

A pro-Isis group has released a hit list with the names of more than 8,000 peoplemostly Americans.

More than 600-people live in Florida, and one security expert believes that many of those targeted live in Palm Beach County and on the Treasure Coast.

The “United Cyber Caliphate” that hacked U.S. Central Command, 54,000 Twitter accounts and threatened President Barack Obama is the same pro-Isis group that’s reportedly created a “kill list” with the names, addresses and emails of thousands of civilian Americans.

Reports of the list came to light online when Vocativ reported the list was shared via the encrypted app, Telegram, and called on supporters to kill.

Former FBI agent-turned lawyer Stuart Kaplan says the threat is especially alarming, because the people on this list are civilians who don’t have the security necessary to protect themselves.

“It’s going to create some hysteria,” he said…","          On Saturday night an Islamist extremist murdered 50 people at a “Pulse” gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida."

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the shooter had an assault-style rifle, a handgun and “some type of device.” Mina added, “It appears he was organized and well-prepared.” Law enforcement sources told CBS News that the shooter was Omar Mateen, a U.S. citizen from Port St. Lucie, Florida.

A FBI agent from the Orlando field office said there are “suggestions” that the suspect may have had “leanings” toward radical Islamic ideology. “We can’t say definitively, so we’re still running everything to ground,” he added.

The gunman was killed by police following the attack, which occurred at about 2 a.m. inside the Pulse Nightclub.

Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said at a news conference Sunday morning that at least 50 were killed in the attack and 53 others wounded. Officials said earlier Sunday that the gunmen killed approximately 20 people and wounded 42 inside the club.

During remarks from the White House Sunday afternoon, President Obama called the attack an ""act of terror.""

""We know enough to say this was an act of terror and an act of hate,"" Obama said. ""The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. ... What is clear is he was a person filled with hatred.""

Multiple outlets have identified the gunman as Omar Mateen, citing law enforcement officials. CBS News reported that Mateen is a U.S. citizen from Port St. Lucie, Florida, born to Afghan parents in 1986. Reports have indicated that the suspect pledged allegiance to ISIS, the terror group that claimed responsibility for devastating attacks in Paris and Brussels.

Authorities classified the shooting as a ""domestic terror incident."" Ron Hopper, an FBI agent in charge of the investigation, indicated Sunday morning that the gunman may have had connections to jihadist terror groups.

""At this time we’re looking at all angles right now,"" Hopper stated at a news conference, according to ABC News. ""We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings towards that, that particular ideology. But right now we can’t say definitively, so we’re still running everything around.""

FBI officials noted that the gunman was ""organized and well-prepared."" He was not from the area, officials said.

A police officer who was working as a security guard at the club exchanged fire with the shooter at about 2 A.M., after which the suspect began taking hostages inside of the club. The gunman was armed with an assault rifle, a handgun, and what officials described as ""some kind of device."" A SWAT team entered the club to rescue the hostages at about 5 A.M., officials said, and the gunmen was killed in a fire fight with the officers.

There were more than 300 people inside the club at the time of the attack.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on CNN that he had been informed the suspect pledged allegiance to ISIS.

""What I’ve heard from the Department of Homeland Security this morning is that, according to local police, he made a pledge of allegiance to ISIL,"" Schiff said, using another name for the terror group.

""[He] was heard praying in a foreign language, and I don’t know if this was at some point during the course of the shooting, but that's what I'm hearing, obviously second-hand, coming ultimately from local police,"" he said.

Schiff said that the circumstances of the attack were ""highly indicative"" of an attack inspired by ISIS, though he added that it is unclear whether the attack was directed by the group.

NBC News later reported that Mateen phoned 911 moments before Sunday morning’s attack to pledge allegiance to ISIS.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is currently investigating the attack as an act of terrorism and looking to determine whether it is ""domestic or international"" terrorism.

The governor of Florida declared a state of emergency following the attack.

The White House said in a statement around 9 a.m. that President Obama had been briefed on the shooting by Lisa Monaco, his adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims. The President asked to receive regular updates as the FBI, and other federal officials, work with the Orlando Police to gather more information, and directed that the federal government provide any assistance necessary to pursue the investigation and support the community,"" the White House said.

President Barack Obama delivered a statement from the White House on what he called a “horrific massacre.”

“This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends -- our fellow Americans -- who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,” said Obama. “The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live.

“The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub -- it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.”

Obama confirmed the shooting was the most deadly in U.S. history.

The suspect was reportedly armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle.

“This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub,” said Obama. “And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

There will be a moment of silence at 6 p.m. local time.

But today’s news sources – the mainstream ones at least, like what you would expect to be bombarded by at airports in addition to radiation – are all universally hogwash. The flow of propaganda and misinformation is nearly ceaseless. (We say “nearly” because MSM outlets occasionally have to take pause while they replace the latest producers to get arrested for sex crimes.)

As is so often the case in current year, up is down and right is left. A “blacklisted” news source is therefore one which doesn’t abstain from telling the truth, regardless of which political party or corporate overlord would rather it not come to light. It is a perilous role, to throw mud at the world’s most influential crooks, but someone has got to do it.

How fitting then that Blacklisted News does exactly that. This fearless cadre of journalists is absolutely vicious. It doesn’t matter how much clout some bigwig wields. If they lie, renege on their promises, or otherwise launch some assault against civilization and decency, Blacklisted News will point the finger.

Naturally, Blacklisted News’s quest for truth doesn’t get them much love from the corporate world. Bounty and Carl's Jr. and Toilet Duck are all eager to throw endless piles of cash at the MSM, which is thoroughly owned and controlled, but the journalists without masters have to go it alone.

Fortunately Blacklisted News has a secret weapon. That’s you. Your generous support means their journos can keep giving migraine headaches to the world’s evilest people, as well as keep you informed. Order a fine piece of Blacklisted News merchandise so you can spread the word and show your support for an increasingly rare and precious thing: actual news.","Blacklisted News is one of the few real news sources – committed to telling the truth, not a pre-approved message.

The gunman behind a mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida has been identified as an citizen of Afghan descent, US television networks reported.

Quoting law enforcement sources, CBS News named the shooter as Omar Mateen, who was born to Afghan parents in 1986 and lives in Port St Lucie, Florida. The network reported that Mateen - who died in a shootout with police after the hostage siege - has no apparent criminal history and that authorities are investigating whether he had ties to Islamic extremism.

According to MSNBC reports, there are certain indications that Mateen could have had :radical influences"" toward Jihadist ideology. The alleged shooter's father said that the incident has nothing to do with religion and is likely a hate crime.

According to reports, Mateen's father said, ""This had nothing to do with religion … but he got really angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami a couple of months ago.""

Mateen's father also said that the alleged shooter had an associates degree in criminal justice and was working a security job. Omar Mateen also has a three-year-old son.

Reports also state that the investigators are looking into Mateen's travel history, early influences and the kind of people he came in contact with recently.",A gunman stormed in a gay nightclub and opened fire on people causing 50 casualties.

David Perdue denies wanting Pres. Obama dead in biblical quote,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (WSAV) – The office of Sen. David Perdue insisted he was not praying for the death of President Obama today, as some critics have said, when he recited a particular Biblical passage during a speech.

The Georgia Republican was speaking at the conservative Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “Road to Majority” event when he said, “I think we’re called to pray for our country, for our leaders and, yes, even our president. Now in his role as president, I think we should pray for Barack Obama.

“But I think we need to be very specific about how we pray. We should pray like Psalms 109:8 says. It says, ‘Let his days be few, let another have his office,’” Perdue added.

After some laughter, he went on to say, “In all seriousness, I believe that America is at a moment of crisis.”

The next verse, which he did not recite, reads “may his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.”

“If Republicans are still wondering why Donald Trump is their nominee, look no further than today’s Faith and Freedom conference where a sitting Republican senator left the impression he was praying for the death of President Obama,” Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada wrote in an email.

In response to questions about the phrase, a spokeswoman for Perdue accused the media of “pushing a narrative to create controversy.”

“Senator Perdue said we are called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and for our president. He in no way wishes harm towards our president and everyone in the room understood that,” spokeswoman Megan Whittemore said in a statement.

The passage is one of the Bible’s “imprecatory psalms,” which as Harvard Divinity School professor Michael Coogan explained to ABC News, is “one of the best examples of an extended series of calling upon God to punish or curse one’s enemy.”

“About half the [imprecatory] psalms are individuals praying to God for help in various situations, and often those situations is one in which the praying individual precedes that he is being persecuted, perhaps unjustly by enemies who are often described in hyperbolic terms like ‘raging lions’ or ‘a pack of dogs’ or something like that,” Coogan said.

When asked what he thought about the use of this psalm in a political speech, Coogan responded, “I can’t imagine that he meant this literally. I think it was tongue in cheek.”

Graham A. Cole, the dean and vice president of education at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois, also weighed in.

“It puzzles me that this psalm was used in this way. It is technically a psalm of lament. That is to say, that it expresses anguish over the state of affairs the psalmist is in. The senator clearly feels such anguish.

“However, the line quoted does not make much sense in the present context. President Obama will indeed be out of office soon and another will take his place. I do not think that the senator’s use of the line necessarily means he wishes death for the president,” Cole wrote in an email.

This isn’t the first time a public official’s use of this 109th chapter of the Old Testament book has elicited some measure of controversy.

A Florida sheriff’s deputy was suspended without pay in 2010 when he left an open Bible with the verse highlighted on a colleague’s desk with a note that said “The Obama Prayer.”","The office of Sen.

Police have shot and killed the gunman, Mina told reporters. “It’s appears he was organized and well-prepared,” the chief said, adding that the shooter had an assault-type weapon, a handgun and “some type of (other) device on him.” Law enforcement sources told CNN that the device, which was strapped to the suspect, was possibly explosive, but authorities don’t know if it was real or not. A canine unit indicated there were explosives inside the suspect’s car as well, the sources said.

The most recent information released by police in Orlando is that 50 people have been killed and a further 53 are hospitalized.

The suspect in the mass shooting at night club in Florida has been identified as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida. U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson identified the shooter in the Sunday incident. He cited law enforcement officials in speaking to reporters. A federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation also identified him. The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Florida Department of Law Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Danny Banks said earlier that the mass shooting is being investigated as an act of terrorism. He says authorities are looking into whether the incident was an act of domestic or international terror, and if the shooter was a lone wolf.

The Orlando police are providing updates via Twitter:

Florida governor Rick Scott is currently en route to Orlando, and we will provide updates as more information is learned.

President Obama called the massacre an “act of terror” and “an act of hate.” He confirmed “the FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terror.”

Governor Rick Scott also called it “an act of terror.”

Scott released this statement before he traveled to Orlando:

Governor Scott said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, families and all those affected by this horrific tragedy. We are a strong and resilient state and we will devote every resource available to assist with the shooting in Orlando. Our state emergency operations center is also monitoring this tragic incident. I have been in constant communication with Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs and state and local law enforcement this morning. I would like to also thank all the first responders who quickly came to assist and help those in need.”

The Islamic State has taken responsibility for the attack. However, no one can confirm if they planned the attack or even inspired it. Reports say that Mateen called 911 to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group’s leader, but no one has confirmed that report yet.

The Hamilton musical has decided to not use muskets in their performance tonight because of the Orlando massacre.

The FBI interviewed Mateen three times, but they came up inclusive. He came to their attention in 2013 “after he made inflammatory remarks to coworkers and alleged terrorist ties.” He made contact with a suicide bomber in 2014, which brought in the FBI again.

Mateen’s Afghan father Seddique Mateen hosted a TV show and portrayed him as president of Afghanistan. He also “holds strong political views, including support for the Afghan Taliban.” From The Washington Post:

Police are currently testing the DNA of three men against a DNA profile they salvaged from Tammy's red jacket, but after 36 years, they don't have much other physical evidence.

(AP) — Lance Armstrong plans to be in Kalamazoo for a “Finishing the Ride” event in honor of the five cyclists killed when they were hit by a pickup truck.

Armstrong said he couldn’t believe it when he heard about the collision on June 7 in Kalamazoo County’s Cooper Township, 160 miles from Chicago, that also left four others injured. Armstrong plans to join Kalamazoo-area cyclists in a 28.5-mile ride Tuesday from Kalamazoo to Plainwell and back.

“For me, this is pretty heavy, thinking the fact that we’re going to complete the ride that they set out to is, I’m not sure that I’m equipped for that emotionally,” Armstrong told the Detroit Free Press.

He said all cyclists share a fear of being struck by a vehicle.

The 50-year-old driver of the pickup, Charles Pickett Jr. of Battle Creek, appeared in court Friday on second-degree murder charges and other crimes. He was ordered held without bond, and an attorney will be appointed to represent him.

The bicyclists were part of a group that called themselves “The Chain Gang.” Killed in the crash were Debra Bradley, 53; Melissa Fevig-Hughes, 42; Fred Nelson, 73; Lorenz Paulik, 74; and Suzanne Sippel, 56. The injured bicyclists were Paul Gobble, 47; Sheila Jeske, 53; Jennifer Johnson, 40; and Paul Runnels, 65.

(AP) — Lance Armstrong plans to be in Kalamazoo for a “Finishing the Ride” event in honor of the five cyclists killed when they were hit by a pickup truck.

Armstrong said he couldn’t believe it when he heard about the collision on June 7 in Kalamazoo County’s Cooper Township, 160 miles from Chicago, that also left four others injured. Armstrong plans to join Kalamazoo-area cyclists in a 28.5-mile ride Tuesday from Kalamazoo to Plainwell and back.

“For me, this is pretty heavy, thinking the fact that we’re going to complete the ride that they set out to is, I’m not sure that I’m equipped for that emotionally,” Armstrong told the Detroit Free Press.

He said all cyclists share a fear of being struck by a vehicle.

The 50-year-old driver of the pickup, Charles Pickett Jr. of Battle Creek, appeared in court Friday on second-degree murder charges and other crimes. He was ordered held without bond, and an attorney will be appointed to represent him.

The bicyclists were part of a group that called themselves “The Chain Gang.” Killed in the crash were Debra Bradley, 53; Melissa Fevig-Hughes, 42; Fred Nelson, 73; Lorenz Paulik, 74; and Suzanne Sippel, 56. The injured bicyclists were Paul Gobble, 47; Sheila Jeske, 53; Jennifer Johnson, 40; and Paul Runnels, 65.

• *Suspect took hostages and died in gunfight with Swat officers
• Suspect named as Omar Mateen and was interveiwed by FBI twice

The US is reeling from its worst ever mass shooting after a man armed with an assault rifle killed 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Fifty three others were wounded in the massacre. The gunman was eventually shot dead by SWAT officers.

He has been identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, a US citizen who was born in New York of parents who were immigrants from Afghanistan.

Police are keeping an open mind on possible links with the militant ISIL group.

“It has been reported that Omar Mateen has made 911 calls this morning, in which he stated his allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State. We’re looking into any and all connections both domestic and international,“said FBI agent Ron Hooper.

However it’s been revealed that Mateen was investigated twice by FBI since 2013 over indications that he supported militant groups but was not on an active terrorism watch list.

ISIL’s Amaq news agency said on Sunday that the Islamist militant group was responsible for the shooting.

However Florida Senator Bill Nelson has said the claim had not been confirmed.

Part of the investigation has focused on a house in Fort Pierce near Orlando which appears to be linked to the suspect.

Mateen is said to have worked for G4S, the world’s largest security firm, since 2007 and carried a gun as part of his duties – according to the company.

Mateen’s father has told the media that the attack “had nothing to do with religion”, saying his son had been angry when he recently saw two men kissing.

In a separate incident in Los Angeles a heavily armed man has been detained near a Los Angeles gay pride festival.

He was arrested after a tip-off, on suspicion of possessing weapons and explosive materials.

Overnight, officials released additional names. However, the identities of more than half of the victims have yet to be made public.

Obama described the attack as ""an act of terror and hate."" The suspect, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, reportedly swore allegiance to the head of the Islamic State in a call to authorities just prior to the attack. The shooting took place at Pulse Orlando Night Club & Ultra Lounge, a popular gay bar, where about 350 people were dancing and drinking. A state of emergency for Orange County was declared by the City of Orlando and Scott.



Mateen was killed by law enforcement in an exchange of gunfire, according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina. Eleven city officers and three deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on leave. An Orlando police officer was shot during the exchange of bullets, but police say his Kevlar helmet saved him.

— ATF HQ (@ATFHQ) June 12, 2016 Seddique Mir Mateen, the father of the shooter, posted a video on his Facebook page early Monday lamenting the loss of his son and his actions.

“My son, Omar Mateen, was a very good boy, an educated boy, who had a child and a wife, very respectful of his parents,” he said in Dari, a language spoken in Afghanistan, according to a translation from The New York Times. 

 “I don’t know what caused this,” he said. “I did not know and did not understand that he has anger in his heart. Only God can punish homosexuality. This is not an issue for humans to punish.” The father told NBC News on Sunday that the shooting “has nothing to do with religion.” In an interview, he suggested his son had become enraged at seeing a gay couple kissing during a recent trip to Miami.

 More than five hours after the shooter was killed, bodies were still inside the club. According to authorities, work at the scene had been complicated by the potential of an explosive device. As night fell, many families of people who were at the club did not know whether their loved ones were killed or hospitalized. Orlando Police began releasing the names of those killed about 14 hours after the shooting. Edward Sotomayor Jr., Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Oscasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero were the first victims identified. All four were killed, police said. Orlando has established a webpage where officials intend to list victims' names once notifications of next of kin have been made. The address is www.cityoforlando.net/victims.

The shooting reportedly began around 2 a.m. An officer responded to a call of shots fired at the club. He first engaged the shooter outside of the club, with gunfire exchanged. The man ran back inside Pulse, shot many of those in the bar, and a hostage situation began. Some who were inside the club thought the gunshots were part of a music set.

 A message on the Pulse Orlando Facebook page at 2:09 a.m. read, ""Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running."" Law enforcement raided the club at 5 a.m., rescuing approximately 30 hostages. The gunman was reportedly carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and a ""device,"" according to Mina. “We were dancing by the hip-hop area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam, and the only thing I could think of was to duck, but I ran out instead,” Joel Figueroa, 19, of Orlando, told The New York Times. “Everybody was screaming and running toward the front door. I didn’t get to see the shooter.”

A friend of his had been shot three times and taken to a hospital, he said. Christopher Hansen dropped to the floor when he heard gunshots. ""I just fell down and crawled out,"" Hansen told the Orlando Sentinel. ""I helped someone who was on the ground. I wasn't sure if he was dead or alive."" Mina Justice told the AP her son Eddie texted her from inside the club. In a video posted to YouTube, Justice said Eddie texted her: ""He's coming. I'm gonna die."" Justice had yet to hear from her son Sunday evening.

Sunday's death toll far surpassed an attack at Virginia Tech in 2007, where 33 were killed, as well as high-profile attacks at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2013, where 28 died, and a mass shooting that killed 14 in San Bernardino, Calif., last December.

 President Obama alluded to these tragedies and others in a fresh call for action on new gun control measures. ""This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, in a house of worship, or in a movie theater or in a nightclub,"" Obama said. ""And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well."" Mateen, 29, was from Port St. Lucie. He was a U.S. citizen, but some of his family members are not. Grayson would not say where the family is from, but several media outlets have reported they are from Afghanistan.

ATF confirmed to the press Sunday afternoon that Mateen purchased a handgun and long gun within the last few days. FBI agent Ron Hopper told the media Sunday morning that the suspect ""may have leanings toward extreme Islamic ideologies."" NBC News reported Mateen called 911 just before the shooting and swore allegiance to the head of the Islamic State. 

 ""The Islamic State news agency has just issued a statement that says they are responsible,"" U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said Sunday afternoon. ""That has not been confirmed."" Security firm G4S confirmed Mateen has been employed with the company for more than eight years. ""We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation,"" G4S said in a statement.
• Orlando Shooter and Timeline: What We Know So Far
• ‘This Has Nothing To Do With Religion,’ Orlando Shooter’s Dad Says The attack was well-organized, and the shooter was well-prepared, officials said. “This is clearly an act of terrorism,” Scott said at a Sunday afternoon press conference. “It’s sickening, (and) it should make every American angry.” Blood donation centers in the Orlando area were full of people ready to donate for the dozens in need, with officials encouraging folks to come back over the next few days. LGBT organization Equality Florida has established a fundraiser to support victims of the shooting. The shooting at the gay bar took place during LGBT pride month, celebrated each year in June. There was a reportedly unrelated arrest in Santa Monica, Calif., where a man was found with assault weapons and explosive materials, possibly meant for the Los Angeles Pride Festival on Sunday, authorities said.

The mass shooting in Orlando has led to an increased police presence for Pride events in Boston, Detroit and Washington, D.C., on Sunday. ""We will not be deterred by hate as we gather to celebrate love,"" said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Gay bars have been targets for attacks in the past, most notably a bomb attack at an Atlanta club in 1997. Marco Guinette, of Massachusetts, owns the MB Lounge in Worcester.

 ""I’m appalled, and they are saying it’s a terrorist attack, which is unfortunately a sad thing this country is dealing with all over the place,"" Guinette told Patch. ""Now, being the owner of the MB, it frightens me to know that now I really have to watch closely. You just don’t know what will come up. It’s just horrific these people died.""
• Suspect Arrested with Guns, Explosives for Possible Use at L.A. Pride Obama said Orlando has the nation's support today and going forward.

""This could have been any one of our communities,"" he said. ""As Americans, we are united in grief, outrage and resolve to defend our people."" U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a press conference that, “Islamic terrorists need to know they will not win.” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, referenced attacks in Paris in November. Coordinated terrorist attacks there left 130 dead, with the majority of those killed at a concert hall. ""This attack is so painfully reminiscent of the terrible attack at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris and other ISIS-inspired attacks in recent years,"" Schiff noted. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said his community needs to stand strong and support the victims and their families.

People who believe they have an immediate family member who may be in the hospital following the shooting are asked to report to the main entrance of Orlando Regional Medical Center's north tower, 52 W. Underwood St. Identification cards are required. Pulse owner Barbara Poma released a statement noted she was grieving with those who lost loved ones. ""From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community,"" Poma wrote. Pulse's cofounder, Ron Legler, who now lives in Baltimore, was ""devastated and heartbroken"" by the news, he wrote on Facebook Sunday. Pulse was founded in 2004 by Poma and Legler. Poma opened the club in honor of her brother John, who died in 1991 after battling HIV for several years, according to the club website.

At Ember in downtown Orlando, crowd members spontaneously broke out into clapping at the close of a twilight candlelight vigil, the Orlando Sentinel reported. At Jones High School, a few miles from Pulse, a vigil organized by the Experience Christian Center brought together seven pastors, “all sharing in prayer, different denominations all coming together for a common cause,” said Experience Senior Pastor Derrick McCrae, the paper reported.

At the start of the live CBS broadcast of the Tony Awards, which honor the best of Broadway, host James Corden gave somber opening remarks addressed to the camera. “All around the world, people are trying to come to terms with the horrific events that took place in Orlando this morning,” he said. “On behalf of the whole theater community and every people in this room, our hearts go out to all of those affected by this atrocity.

UPDATE: 10:23 a.m. EDT – At least 50 people were killed in the shooting in a nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning, up from a previously estimated 20 casualties, Mayor Buddy Dwyer said at a news conference Sunday. There were at least 53 people wounded in the same incident.

Authorities in Orlando, Florida, were investigating domestic terror as a possible motive behind a shooting that left 20 dead and at least 42 wounded at a gay nightclub early Sunday. Police are still looking at all possible motives but said there was evidence the shooter had ties to some Islamic extremist groups.

""We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings toward that, that particular ideology. But right now, we can’t say definitively, so we’re still running everything around,” said Ron Hopper, FBI assistant agent and head of the Tampa division, at a Sunday press conference.

The assailant opened fire on the nightclub around 2 a.m. Sunday, reportedly using an assault rifle and a handgun to kill 20 people. He may have had some kind of explosive device strapped to him, according to police.

After the attacker took hostages, law enforcement used explosives and an armored car to break down a wall and enter the nightclub, killing the attacker in a shootout. Police have now identified the deceased suspect as Omar Mateen, CBS News reported. Mateen was approximately 30 years old, a U.S. citizen born to Afghan parents in neighboring Port St. Lucie, Florida. He appears to have acted alone.

The Orlando community mourned for the loss of life Sunday morning; notably, the shooting came as gay pride week festivities were in full swing. The club had been a treasured spot, and its owner opened it to raise awareness about issues in the gay and lesbian community after her brother John died of AIDS.

""It was important to create an atmosphere that embraced the gay lifestyle with décor that would make John proud. Most importantly, [we] coined the name Pulse for John’s heartbeat — as a club that is John’s inspiration, where he is kept alive in the eyes of his friends and family,"" reads a description from the club’s website.

Before he was killed by police, he murdered at least 20 individuals and wounded dozens more. The death toll could rise further.

The FBI reportedly suspects that the shooter may have “leanings towards radical Islamic terrorism.” Some accounts indicate that he was, like so many so-called “lone wolves,” actually a “known wolf” – a jihadist already identified as a potential threat by authorities, but allowed to continue to operate.

Now that latitude appears to have translated into the murder and wounding of dozens of gay people, an action consistent with the teachings of the totalitarian Islamic supremacist doctrine known as sharia, which requires its adherents to hate and kill homosexuals.

A posting last night at CounterJihad.com shows that the genesis of this practice is found in a hadith which has Muhammad saying that “whomever you find doing the actions of the people of Lot, kill the one doing it, and the one it is done to.” While the authorities of Islam disagree about what is the preferred way to kill gays and lesbians – throwing them off buildings, hanging them, burning them alive – there is no question but that murdering them is sanctioned by sharia.

As it happens, in 2013, an Islamic supremacist named Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar made this point in a speech at the Husseini Islamic Center in Sanford, Florida – about 20 miles from Orlando and two hours drive from Mateen’s home in Port St. Lucie. It is unclear at this writing whether the shooter was associated with this mosque or aware of this particular exhortation to kill homosexuals. But if indeed he was a sharia-adherent Muslim, there is no doubt that he was aware that his duty was to take homophobia to its murderous extreme.

It is absolutely predictable that Muslim Brotherhood front organizations like the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) will shortly denounce this act of violence, insist that it has nothing to do with Islam, and lowball any ties the perpetrator may have had to one or more Orlando area mosques. Instead, they will try to deflect attention to those they accuse of “Islamophobia” for connecting the obvious – and ominous – dots. In fact, CAIR has scheduled a press conference on Tuesday at its headquarters in Washington for the purpose of defaming American patriots who oppose the Islamist agenda and those, like the Muslim Brotherhood with its pre-violent “civilization jihad,” who are enabling violent jihadists, here and elsewhere.

The Islamic State and al Qaeda have both called for individual jihadists to use the month of Ramadan, which began on June 6th, to attack Americans in this country. This murderous act in Orlando may prove to have been inspired by such calls, or by Sheik Sekaleshfar, or simply by the tenets of sharia.

We can only hope that – whatever its inspiration – Mateen’s is the last such act of jihad in America. But for there to be any chance that will be the case, we are going to have to stop importing more jihadists, designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization (the object of pending legislation sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart), and shut down the Brotherhood’s mosques and front groups that are promoting sharia and the realization of its ultimate objective, which is – in the Brotherhood’s own words – “destroying Western civilization from within.”

As former Department of Homeland Security whistleblower and best-selling author of See Something, Say Nothing Philip Haney points out, the jihadists won’t stop trying to kill us, homosexuals and straights alike, until we stop them. And that’s what we must be about now.","We can only hope that the Orlando attack is the last act of jihad in America. But we are going to have to stop importing more jihadists, designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, and shut down the Brotherhood’s mosques and front groups that are promoting sharia."

UPDATE: 12:45 p.m. EDT — The local Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has begun soliciting blood donations for victims of a shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Sunday.

The helmet deflected a bullet during the raid that saved the lives of at least 30 people.

UPDATE: 11:27 a.m. EDT – The weapon used to kill 50 people and wound at least 53 more in a nightclub in Florida Sunday was an AR-15-style, similar to the rifle used in the Sandy Hook massacre that left 26 dead at an elementary school in Connecticut in 2012.

Local religious and political leaders joined in the mourning of the dead, as Imam Muhammad Musri, leader of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, called on the media not to politicize the night's event.

""I'm here today to stand as a faith leader with our law enforcement community and city leadership,"" Musri said, adding, ""I want to caution many in the media from rushing to judgment.""

UPDATE: 10:23 a.m. EDT – At least 50 people were killed in the shooting in a nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning, up from a previously estimated 20 casualties, Mayor Buddy Dwyer said at a news conference Sunday. There were at least 53 people wounded in the same incident.

Authorities in Orlando, Florida, were investigating domestic terror as a possible motive behind a shooting that left 20 dead and at least 42 wounded at a gay nightclub early Sunday. Police are still looking at all possible motives but said there was evidence the shooter had ties to some Islamic extremist groups.

""We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings toward that, that particular ideology. But right now, we can’t say definitively, so we’re still running everything around,” said Ron Hopper, FBI assistant agent and head of the Tampa division, at a Sunday press conference.

The assailant opened fire on the nightclub around 2 a.m. Sunday, reportedly using an assault rifle and a handgun to kill 20 people. He may have had some kind of explosive device strapped to him, according to police.

After the attacker took hostages, law enforcement used explosives and an armored car to break down a wall and enter the nightclub, killing the attacker in a shootout. Police have now identified the deceased suspect as Omar Mateen, CBS News reported. Mateen was approximately 30 years old, a U.S. citizen born to Afghan parents in neighboring Port St. Lucie, Florida. He appears to have acted alone.

The Orlando community mourned for the loss of life Sunday morning; notably, the shooting came as gay pride week festivities were in full swing. The club had been a treasured spot, and its owner opened it to raise awareness about issues in the gay and lesbian community after her brother John died of AIDS.

""It was important to create an atmosphere that embraced the gay lifestyle with décor that would make John proud. Most importantly, [we] coined the name Pulse for John’s heartbeat — as a club that is John’s inspiration, where he is kept alive in the eyes of his friends and family,"" reads a description from the club’s website.

President Barack Obama has now been briefed on the news, and likely presidential nominees Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton reacted to the night's events in posts to Twitter Sunday morning, expressing their concern for the situation.",The worst mass shooting in U.S. history left 50 dead and 53 injured at a Florida nightclub.

At least 50 people were killed after a gunman opened fire on the popular gay club early Sunday morning, and the investigation is ongoing.

UPDATE: 12:00 p.m. EDT — Two members of Congress linked the alleged shooter in Sunday’s Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub shooting to Islamic radicalism. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told CNN his sources confirmed the gunman, identified as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, had ties overseas and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., tweeted the shooter had a “connection to ISIS.”

UPDATE: 11:41 a.m. EDT – A Kevlar helmet may have saved the life of an Orlando police officer who was struck during the rescue mission at Pulse nightclub early Sunday morning, according to a tweet posted to the Orlando Police Department’s verified Twitter account. The helmet deflected a bullet during the raid that saved the lives of at least 30 people.

UPDATE: 11:27 a.m. EDT – The weapon used to kill 50 people and wound at least 53 more in a nightclub in Florida Sunday was an AR-15-style, similar to the rifle used in the Sandy Hook massacre that left 26 dead at an elementary school in Connecticut in 2012. The gunman who attacked the Pulse nightclub had been armed with a AR-15-style rifle and a handgun, according to Orlando Police Department Chief John Mina.

UPDATE: 11:15 a.m. EDT – The father of reported gunman Omar Mateen, who killed 50 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, apologized for his son’s actions Sunday. Mateen’s father Mir Seddique said the incident had nothing to do with religion and may have been a result of deep anger his son felt after seeing two gay men kissing several months earlier.

""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country,"" Seddique told NBC News.

UPDATE: 10:59 a.m. EDT – The gunman who killed 50 people and wounded at least 53 more in a gay nightclub early Sunday morning received training from terrorists in Afghanistan, New York Republican Rep. Peter King said Sunday morning. The deceased assailant has been identified as Florida resident and U.S. citizen Omar Mateen, aged 29.

""He was from Afghanistan and was trained in the use of weapons — that's as far as I'll go,"" King told CNN Sunday.

UPDATE: 10:36 a.m. EDT – The FBI are in the process of notifying families who lost loved ones in a shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida early Sunday in what authorities are calling one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history. The agency has also encouraged everyone who attended Pulse nightclub at any point Saturday to come forward with any information they may have.

Local religious and political leaders joined in the mourning of the dead, as Imam Muhammad Musri, leader of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, called on the media not to politicize the night's event.

""I'm here today to stand as a faith leader with our law enforcement community and city leadership,"" Musri said, adding, ""I want to caution many in the media from rushing to judgment.""

UPDATE: 10:23 a.m. EDT – At least 50 people were killed in the shooting in a nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning, up from a previously estimated 20 casualties, Mayor Buddy Dwyer said at a news conference Sunday. There were at least 53 people wounded in the same incident.

Authorities in Orlando, Florida, were investigating domestic terror as a possible motive behind a shooting that left 20 dead and at least 42 wounded at a gay nightclub early Sunday. Police are still looking at all possible motives but said there was evidence the shooter had ties to some Islamic extremist groups.

""We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings toward that, that particular ideology. But right now, we can’t say definitively, so we’re still running everything around,” said Ron Hopper, FBI assistant agent and head of the Tampa division, at a Sunday press conference.

The assailant opened fire on the nightclub around 2 a.m. Sunday, reportedly using an assault rifle and a handgun to kill 20 people. He may have had some kind of explosive device strapped to him, according to police.

After the attacker took hostages, law enforcement used explosives and an armored car to break down a wall and enter the nightclub, killing the attacker in a shootout. Police have now identified the deceased suspect as Omar Mateen, CBS News reported. Mateen was approximately 30 years old, a U.S. citizen born to Afghan parents in neighboring Port St. Lucie, Florida. He appears to have acted alone.

The Orlando community mourned for the loss of life Sunday morning; notably, the shooting came as gay pride week festivities were in full swing. The club had been a treasured spot, and its owner opened it to raise awareness about issues in the gay and lesbian community after her brother John died of AIDS.

""It was important to create an atmosphere that embraced the gay lifestyle with décor that would make John proud. Most importantly, [we] coined the name Pulse for John’s heartbeat — as a club that is John’s inspiration, where he is kept alive in the eyes of his friends and family,"" reads a description from the club’s website.

President Barack Obama has now been briefed on the news, and likely presidential nominees Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton reacted to the night's events in posts to Twitter Sunday morning, expressing their concern for the situation.",The worst mass shooting in U.S. history left 50 dead and 53 injured at a Florida nightclub.

Before the shooting early Sunday, Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, Fla., allegedly called 911 to align himself with the militant group, officials told CNN and NBC News.

Orlando, Fla., Mayor Buddy Dyer said that at least 50 people were killed and 53 more were hospitalized, making Sunday's attack at the Pulse nightclub the deadliest shooting in U.S. history.

""It's absolutely terrible ... 50 victims in one location, one shooting. Absolutely one of the worst tragedies we've seen,"" Orlando Police Chief John Mina said.

Before Sunday, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history was when a gunman opened fire on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, Va., killing 32 people in 2007.

Dozens of people were taken hostage inside the nightclub between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Sunday morning by a gunman carrying an assault rifle and a handgun.

Orlando police tweeted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives stated Mateen purchased the firearms legally in Florida within the past week.

In an afternoon press conference, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper told reporters his agency took the lead on the investigation and that the FBI had been aware of Mateen since 2013 when he made ""inflammatory comments"" to coworkers that ""alleged possible terrorist ties.""

""The FBI thoroughly investigated the matter, including interviews of witnesses, physical surveillance and records checks,"" he said.

Mateen was interviewed twice during this time, but Hopper said the investigation was closed after the FBI was ""unable to verify the substance of his comments.""

He was interviewed by the FBI again in 2014 for possible ties to American suicide bomber Moner Abu-Salha, but determined that their contact was ""minimal"" and ""did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time.""

Earlier in the day, Hopper said the FBI was considering multiple motives for the shooting.

""At this point in time we're just conducting a general investigation, period,"" Hopper told reporters. ""We'll determine whether officially if its a hate crime, or a terrorism incident or even a violent crime once we have all the facts in place.""

Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for Orange County after the shooting.

""You just can't imagine this would happen to our community, our state or anywhere in our country,"" Scott told reporters. ""For somebody to go in there and be an active shooter and take that number of lives and injure that many people is clearly an act of terror. ""

Officers killed the gunman Mateen, in a series of shootouts in which one officer sustained a head injury after a bullet hit his helmet.

The officers involved in the shootout were relieved of their duty and will be investigated by the Florida department of law enforcement, in what Mina said was standard practice.

An explosion was reported in the area of the nightclub but police described it as ""a controlled explosion by law enforcement.""

Orlando police bomb squad arrived at the scene to search the area and remove any ""devices"" similar to the one worn by the gunman that may have been placed inside the club.

""Tonight, we had a crime that will have a lasting effect on our community,"" Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said in a news conference.

Dyer said said that he contacted the White House, which granted a request to waive Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -- or HIPPA law -- in order to allow hospitals to contact the families of the injured.

It's unclear why Pulse -- which describes itself as a gay nightclub -- was targeted in the attack.

Terry DeCarlo, director of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Community Center of Central Florida, told the Orlando Sentinel the community was shocked and angered.

""This just makes no sense,"" he said. ""This was an attack on the LGBT community.""

Pulse describes itself as ""the hottest gay bar"" in Orlando and and was planning a ""Latin flavor"" event Saturday night.

Co-owner Barbara Poma opened Pulse in 2004 in memory of her brother John, who died of AIDS in 1991.

Of the fatalities, 39 victims and Mateen were pronounced dead at the site and two bodies were found in the parking lot, Dyer said. Another eleven people were taken to hospitals and pronounced dead there, he said.

Forty-three of the injured were transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center, a hospital spokesperson said, with 26 operations being performed.

The city of Orlando released the names of the first eight fatalities: Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34; Stanley Almodovar III, 23; Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20; Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22; Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36; Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz, 22; Luis S.

He called 911 just before the Orlando club shooting and swore allegiance to the Islamic State terror group, NBC News reported, quoting multiple unnamed law enforcement officials.

Soon after, Islamic State’s Amaq news agency claimed the group was responsible for the shooting that killed at least 50 people at the Florida nightclub. But Senator Bill Nelson said the claim was not yet confirmed.

US officials said they had no immediate evidence of any direct connection between the worst mass shooting in US history and Islamic State or any other foreign extremist group, Reuters reported.

But, a top Democrat on a congressional intelligence committee said local law enforcement believed the suspect in the deadly Orlando shooting had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, which claims to be behind the Paris and Brussels attacks.

“The fact that this shooting took place during Ramadan and that ISIS leadership in Raqqa has been urging attacks during this time, that the target was an LGBT night club during Pride, and - if accurate - that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to ISIS, indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism,” representative Adam Schiff said in a statement.

Florida governor Rick Scott too said the overnight shooting was “clearly an act of terror”.

“For somebody to go in there and be an active shooter and take that number (of lives) ... is clearly an act of terror,” the Republican told a news conference.

The father of the suspected gunman said he believed his son was motivated by hatred of gays -- not by his Muslim religion.

“This had nothing to do with religion,” Mir Seddique told NBC News.

He said his son recently lashed out in his presence after witnessing a gay couple embracing in downtown Miami, and suggested the incident may have triggered the atrocity.

“He saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry,” Seddique told the network.

Fox News reported that he was known to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but the reason was not immediately clear.

A Twitter account associated with Islamic State militant group posted a photo purported to be of Mateen.

“The man who carried out the Florida nightclub attack which killed 50 people and injured dozens,” the caption accompanying the photo read.

It was not possible to verify whether the picture was in fact of Mateen. Other Twitter accounts linked to Islamist militancy also carried photos of the same individual, and Islamic State supporters posted messages of praise for the attack.

The agency had interviewed Mateen in 2013 and again in 2014, the latter instance for his possible connections to suicide bomber Moner Abu Salha, releasing him after they found no “substantial relationship” between the two men.

Mateen had legally purchased two weapons in the past week, a spokesperson from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in the same news conference. He reportedly used an AR-15-style assault rifle when he opened fire on clubgoers Sunday morning around 2 a.m.

UPDATE 3:20 p.m. EDT – Leaders throughout the state of Florida and throughout the country offered their support to the victims of a mass shooting at a club in Orlando, encouraging people to comfort and love one another. Florida Gov. Rick Scott called for everyone in the nation to observe a moment of silence at 6 p.m. EDT Sunday to memorialize the victims of an attack that left 50 dead and 53 wounded.

“We need to support each other, we need to love each other and we will not be defined by a hateful shooter,” Mayor John Hugh ""Buddy"" Dyer said.

The remaining three presidential candidates, Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, as well as Republican Donald Trump, made public statements on their social media accounts. All three condemned the attack, with Trump congratulating himself on Twitter for “being right on Islamic terrorism.”

UPDATE 2:45 p.m. EDT – The terror organization known as the Islamic State group, or ISIS, claimed responsibility for a mass shooting in a gay nightclub around 2 a.m. Sunday morning in Orlando, Florida, Reuters reported.

UPDATE 2:21 p.m. EDT – The ex-wife of Omar Mateen, the reported gunman of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub Sunday morning, said she had left her former husband for beating her and for being mentally unstable. His ex-wife spoke to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity, describing Mateen as a violent man who was not very religious.

“He was not a stable person,” Mateen’s ex-wife told the Post. “He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.”

UPDATE: 2:02 p.m. EDT — President Barack Obama addressed the country in a news conference Sunday afternoon, condemning the massacre early Sunday morning that left 50 people dead in a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Obama expressed his condolences while reminding the country of how easy it is for someone to purchase an assault weapon in the U.S.

“Today as Americans we grieve the brutal murder and horrific massacre of dozens of innocent people,” he said, adding, “We know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate.”

Pope Francis, leader of the Roman Catholic Church, added his condolences to the victims and their families, calling the incident “senseless hatred,” Agence-France Presse reported.

UPDATE 1:36 p.m. EDT — Law enforcement agencies say reported gunman Omar Mateen pledged his allegiance to the terror organization known as the Islamic State group in a 911 call before he opened fire on a gay nightclub early Sunday, NBC News reported. At least 50 people died and 53 more were wounded in an attack that was the worst mass shooting on U.S. soil.

UPDATE: 1:01 p.m. EDT — Presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders condemned Sunday’s attack on a Florida nightclub, saying that comprehensive gun reform was needed to stop future attacks from happening.

“We should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people. We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them, criminals, people who are mentally ill,” he told NBC News.

UPDATE: 12:45 p.m. EDT — The local Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has begun soliciting blood donations for victims of a shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Sunday. The organization offered their condolences to victims and their families after authorities revealed the reported shooter may have had connections to Islamic extremist groups.

“The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,” the group said in a statement.

UPDATE: 12:30 p.m. EDT — Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency following a massacre at an Orlando nightclub that left 50 dead early Sunday morning. News of the state of emergency came as reports surfaced that law enforcement had suspected shooter Omar Mateen on their radar for at least the past five years, CBS News reported.

“We will come together and do everything we can for everyone who was impacted,"" Scott said, adding, “It’s devastating. You don’t want this to happen anywhere in the world.”

UPDATE: 12:16 p.m. EDT — The Tony Awards will dedicate Sunday evening’s show to the victims of the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, according to a Tweet posted from the verified account of the awards show.

UPDATE: 12:00 p.m. EDT — Two members of Congress linked the alleged shooter in Sunday’s Orlando, Florida, gay nightclub shooting to Islamic radicalism. Rep.

UPDATE: 11:41 a.m. EDT – A Kevlar helmet may have saved the life of an Orlando police officer who was struck during the rescue mission at Pulse nightclub early Sunday morning, according to a tweet posted to the Orlando Police Department’s verified Twitter account. The helmet deflected a bullet during the raid that saved the lives of at least 30 people.

UPDATE: 11:27 a.m. EDT – The weapon used to kill 50 people and wound at least 53 more in a nightclub in Florida Sunday was an AR-15-style, similar to the rifle used in the Sandy Hook massacre that left 26 dead at an elementary school in Connecticut in 2012. The gunman who attacked the Pulse nightclub had been armed with a AR-15-style rifle and a handgun, according to Orlando Police Department Chief John Mina.

UPDATE: 11:15 a.m. EDT – The father of reported gunman Omar Mateen, who killed 50 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, apologized for his son’s actions Sunday. Mateen’s father Mir Seddique said the incident had nothing to do with religion and may have been a result of deep anger his son felt after seeing two gay men kissing several months earlier.

""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country,"" Seddique told NBC News.

UPDATE: 10:59 a.m. EDT – The gunman who killed 50 people and wounded at least 53 more in a gay nightclub early Sunday morning received training from terrorists in Afghanistan, New York Republican Rep. Peter King said Sunday morning. The deceased assailant has been identified as Florida resident and U.S. citizen Omar Mateen, aged 29.

""He was from Afghanistan and was trained in the use of weapons — that's as far as I'll go,"" King told CNN Sunday.

UPDATE: 10:36 a.m. EDT – The FBI are in the process of notifying families who lost loved ones in a shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida early Sunday in what authorities are calling one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history. The agency has also encouraged everyone who attended Pulse nightclub at any point Saturday to come forward with any information they may have.

Local religious and political leaders joined in the mourning of the dead, as Imam Muhammad Musri, leader of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, called on the media not to politicize the night's event.

""I'm here today to stand as a faith leader with our law enforcement community and city leadership,"" Musri said, adding, ""I want to caution many in the media from rushing to judgment.""

UPDATE: 10:23 a.m. EDT – At least 50 people were killed in the shooting in a nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning, up from a previously estimated 20 casualties, Mayor Buddy Dwyer said at a news conference Sunday. There were at least 53 people wounded in the same incident.

Authorities in Orlando, Florida, were investigating domestic terror as a possible motive behind a shooting that left 20 dead and at least 42 wounded at a gay nightclub early Sunday. Police are still looking at all possible motives but said there was evidence the shooter had ties to some Islamic extremist groups.

""We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings toward that, that particular ideology. But right now, we can’t say definitively, so we’re still running everything around,” said Ron Hopper, FBI assistant agent and head of the Tampa division, at a Sunday press conference.

The assailant opened fire on the nightclub around 2 a.m. Sunday, reportedly using an assault rifle and a handgun to kill 20 people. He may have had some kind of explosive device strapped to him, according to police.

After the attacker took hostages, law enforcement used explosives and an armored car to break down a wall and enter the nightclub, killing the attacker in a shootout. Police have now identified the deceased suspect as Omar Mateen, CBS News reported. Mateen was approximately 30 years old, a U.S. citizen born to Afghan parents in neighboring Port St. Lucie, Florida. He appears to have acted alone.

The Orlando community mourned for the loss of life Sunday morning; notably, the shooting came as gay pride week festivities were in full swing. The club had been a treasured spot, and its owner opened it to raise awareness about issues in the gay and lesbian community after her brother John died of AIDS.

""It was important to create an atmosphere that embraced the gay lifestyle with décor that would make John proud. Most importantly, [we] coined the name Pulse for John’s heartbeat — as a club that is John’s inspiration, where he is kept alive in the eyes of his friends and family,"" reads a description from the club’s website.

President Barack Obama has now been briefed on the news, and likely presidential nominees Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton reacted to the night's events in posts to Twitter Sunday morning, expressing their concern for the situation.",The worst mass shooting in U.S. history left 50 dead and 53 injured at a Florida nightclub.

Overnight, officials released additional names. However, the identities of more than half of the victims have yet to be made public.

Obama described the attack as ""an act of terror and hate."" The suspect, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, reportedly swore allegiance to the head of the Islamic State in a call to authorities just prior to the attack. The shooting took place at Pulse Orlando Night Club & Ultra Lounge, a popular gay bar, where about 350 people were dancing and drinking. A state of emergency for Orange County was declared by the City of Orlando and Scott.



Mateen was killed by law enforcement in an exchange of gunfire, according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina. Eleven city officers and three deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on leave. An Orlando police officer was shot during the exchange of bullets, but police say his Kevlar helmet saved him.

— ATF HQ (@ATFHQ) June 12, 2016 Seddique Mir Mateen, the father of the shooter, posted a video on his Facebook page early Monday lamenting the loss of his son and his actions.

“My son, Omar Mateen, was a very good boy, an educated boy, who had a child and a wife, very respectful of his parents,” he said in Dari, a language spoken in Afghanistan, according to a translation from The New York Times. 

 “I don’t know what caused this,” he said. “I did not know and did not understand that he has anger in his heart. Only God can punish homosexuality. This is not an issue for humans to punish.” The father told NBC News on Sunday that the shooting “has nothing to do with religion.” In an interview, he suggested his son had become enraged at seeing a gay couple kissing during a recent trip to Miami.

 More than five hours after the shooter was killed, bodies were still inside the club. According to authorities, work at the scene had been complicated by the potential of an explosive device. As night fell, many families of people who were at the club did not know whether their loved ones were killed or hospitalized. Orlando Police began releasing the names of those killed about 14 hours after the shooting. Edward Sotomayor Jr., Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Oscasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero were the first victims identified. All four were killed, police said. Orlando has established a webpage where officials intend to list victims' names once notifications of next of kin have been made. The address is www.cityoforlando.net/victims.

The shooting reportedly began around 2 a.m. An officer responded to a call of shots fired at the club. He first engaged the shooter outside of the club, with gunfire exchanged. The man ran back inside Pulse, shot many of those in the bar, and a hostage situation began. Some who were inside the club thought the gunshots were part of a music set.

 A message on the Pulse Orlando Facebook page at 2:09 a.m. read, ""Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running."" Law enforcement raided the club at 5 a.m., rescuing approximately 30 hostages. The gunman was reportedly carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and a ""device,"" according to Mina. “We were dancing by the hip-hop area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam, and the only thing I could think of was to duck, but I ran out instead,” Joel Figueroa, 19, of Orlando, told The New York Times. “Everybody was screaming and running toward the front door. I didn’t get to see the shooter.”

A friend of his had been shot three times and taken to a hospital, he said. Christopher Hansen dropped to the floor when he heard gunshots. ""I just fell down and crawled out,"" Hansen told the Orlando Sentinel. ""I helped someone who was on the ground. I wasn't sure if he was dead or alive."" Mina Justice told the AP her son Eddie texted her from inside the club. In a video posted to YouTube, Justice said Eddie texted her: ""He's coming. I'm gonna die."" Justice had yet to hear from her son Sunday evening.

Sunday's death toll far surpassed an attack at Virginia Tech in 2007, where 33 were killed, as well as high-profile attacks at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2013, where 28 died, and a mass shooting that killed 14 in San Bernardino, Calif., last December.

 President Obama alluded to these tragedies and others in a fresh call for action on new gun control measures. ""This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, in a house of worship, or in a movie theater or in a nightclub,"" Obama said. ""And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well."" Mateen, 29, was from Port St. Lucie. He was a U.S. citizen, but some of his family members are not. Grayson would not say where the family is from, but several media outlets have reported they are from Afghanistan.

ATF confirmed to the press Sunday afternoon that Mateen purchased a handgun and long gun within the last few days. FBI agent Ron Hopper told the media Sunday morning that the suspect ""may have leanings toward extreme Islamic ideologies."" NBC News reported Mateen called 911 just before the shooting and swore allegiance to the head of the Islamic State. 

 ""The Islamic State news agency has just issued a statement that says they are responsible,"" U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said Sunday afternoon. ""That has not been confirmed."" Security firm G4S confirmed Mateen has been employed with the company for more than eight years. ""We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation,"" G4S said in a statement.
• Orlando Shooter and Timeline: What We Know So Far
• ‘This Has Nothing To Do With Religion,’ Orlando Shooter’s Dad Says The attack was well-organized, and the shooter was well-prepared, officials said. “This is clearly an act of terrorism,” Scott said at a Sunday afternoon press conference. “It’s sickening, (and) it should make every American angry.” Blood donation centers in the Orlando area were full of people ready to donate for the dozens in need, with officials encouraging folks to come back over the next few days. LGBT organization Equality Florida has established a fundraiser to support victims of the shooting. The shooting at the gay bar took place during LGBT pride month, celebrated each year in June. There was a reportedly unrelated arrest in Santa Monica, Calif., where a man was found with assault weapons and explosive materials, possibly meant for the Los Angeles Pride Festival on Sunday, authorities said.

The mass shooting in Orlando has led to an increased police presence for Pride events in Boston, Detroit and Washington, D.C., on Sunday. ""We will not be deterred by hate as we gather to celebrate love,"" said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Gay bars have been targets for attacks in the past, most notably a bomb attack at an Atlanta club in 1997. Marco Guinette, of Massachusetts, owns the MB Lounge in Worcester.

 ""I’m appalled, and they are saying it’s a terrorist attack, which is unfortunately a sad thing this country is dealing with all over the place,"" Guinette told Patch. ""Now, being the owner of the MB, it frightens me to know that now I really have to watch closely. You just don’t know what will come up. It’s just horrific these people died.""
• Suspect Arrested with Guns, Explosives for Possible Use at L.A. Pride Obama said Orlando has the nation's support today and going forward.

""This could have been any one of our communities,"" he said. ""As Americans, we are united in grief, outrage and resolve to defend our people."" U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a press conference that, “Islamic terrorists need to know they will not win.” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, referenced attacks in Paris in November. Coordinated terrorist attacks there left 130 dead, with the majority of those killed at a concert hall. ""This attack is so painfully reminiscent of the terrible attack at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris and other ISIS-inspired attacks in recent years,"" Schiff noted. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said his community needs to stand strong and support the victims and their families.

People who believe they have an immediate family member who may be in the hospital following the shooting are asked to report to the main entrance of Orlando Regional Medical Center's north tower, 52 W. Underwood St. Identification cards are required. Pulse owner Barbara Poma released a statement noted she was grieving with those who lost loved ones. ""From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community,"" Poma wrote. Pulse's cofounder, Ron Legler, who now lives in Baltimore, was ""devastated and heartbroken"" by the news, he wrote on Facebook Sunday. Pulse was founded in 2004 by Poma and Legler. Poma opened the club in honor of her brother John, who died in 1991 after battling HIV for several years, according to the club website.

Officers in Orlando, Florida said Mateen, who had Afghan parents and had undergone weapons training, came from Port Saint Lucie in Florida. The killer, who later shot dead in a gunfight with Swat officers, was not on the US terrorism list but was being investigated for another unrelated crime.

A Twitter account associated with Islamic State reportedly posted an image of Mateen following the sickening massacre. The caption accompanying the photo read: ""The man who carried out the Florida nightclub attack which killed 50 people and injured dozens."" Other accounts linked to ISIS celebrated the shootings, with one tweeting: ""Stop killing Muslims in Iraq and Syria if you want to live in peace."" The terror group, also known as Daesh, is thought to have radicalised a Muslim couple who slaughted 14 in a separate attack in California last year.

The killer's father Mir Mateen said his family were in ""shock"" at the attack but insisted there was no religious motive. He said: ""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country."" FBI spokesman Ron Hopper told a press conference this afternoon there are ""suggestions"" the gunman ""may have leanings"" toward jihadist ideology.

Congressman Michael McCaul said: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this senseless tragedy, their families and the people of Orlando. ""This appears to be the worst terrorist attack on US soil since 9/11. ""It is a sobering reminder that radical Islamists are targeting our country and our way of life. Americans will not be intimidated.""

Florida senator and ex-Presidental hopeful Marco Rubio said the attack was indicative of the way radical Islam views gay people and lesbians. He told local media: ""If you look at the nature of the attack, it doesn't take an enormous amount of coordination to do this. ""We have seen the way gays and lesbians are treated by radical Islam. So in some ways it's not surprising. I am confident the FBI and Homeland Security are on this.""

Pulse, which describes itself as the ""hottest gay club in Orlando"", issued a statement on Facebook following the incident. The nightspot posted: ""Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event. Thank you for your thoughts and love.""

I finally had a chance to read through the rulings, which do not guarantee early release for any prisoner but could allow hundreds of Iowans to have their sentences reviewed, if they were convicted for crimes committed as minors.

Follow me after the jump for background and key points from the three rulings. Unfortunately, Governor Terry Branstad still seems to be missing the point of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that set all of these cases in motion.

In June 2012, a divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v Alabama (pdf) that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles convicted of murder are unconstitutional. The Miller decision potentially affected 38 Iowans serving life without parole sentences in state prisons, plus ten more Iowans doing time in other state prisons or federal prisons for crimes committed when they were under age 18.

Within weeks, the Iowa Court of Appeals ordered new sentencing for two prisoners serving mandatory life without parole sentences. Each had been convicted of crimes committed at age 17.

Looking to short-circuit the possible release of any convicted killer, Governor Branstad decided in July 2012 to commute the life without parole sentences “to life with the possibility of parole only after 60 years for the 38 people who were convicted of First Degree Murder while a juvenile.” I argued at the time that the governor’s action went against the spirit of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, because he did not consider the individual circumstances of any criminal affected by his actions. The majority in Miller called for greater discretion, not a one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing murderers who were under 18 at the time of their crimes. Branstad jumped to the conclusion that none of these 38 people could be rehabilitated and all deserved to stay in prison until at least their late 70s, if they lived that long.

One of the 38 was Jeffrey Ragland, who had been serving a mandatory life sentence for his involvement in a 1986 murder. Many years earlier, he had tried and failed to have that sentence reduced, on the grounds that he did not strike the blow that killed the murder victim. Last summer he went to court arguing that his new sentence requiring at least 60 years in prison before parole violated the constitutional principles outlined in Miller.

Side note: Ragland’s case illustrates how important it is to have a good attorney if you are ever accused of a crime. His three friends reached plea bargains with prosecutors and served far less time. In fact, the boy who struck the killing blow only served three years for second-degree murder before being paroled. Ragland refused to plead guilty, so was charged and convicted of first-degree murder (because he had started the fight that ended in a killing) and sentenced to life without any hope of parole. The letter the killer wrote in 2012, urging the district court to show leniency when resentencing Ragland, is one of the saddest things I have read lately (see pages 6-7 of this pdf file).

But the State of Iowa appealed that sentence to the Iowa Supreme Court. Ryan Koopmans paraphrases their arguments:

After reading the facts of the Ragland case, I would be embarrassed to be the state attorney arguing that Branstad’s actions were consistent with the Miller ruling. Here’s a prisoner who was convicted of murder even though he didn’t directly kill anyone, much less kill a person in a pre-meditated way. Neither the details of the crime nor his behavior in prison nor the support system in place for him post-parole were taken into account when Branstad issued his blanket commutation. Just let the guy rot in state custody until he’s 78 years old.

Anyway, in State v. Ragland, the Iowa Supreme Court was asked to decide whether a minimum 60-year sentence for a crime committed as a juvenile offers a “meaningful” opportunity for parole. Ryan Koopmans provided a thumbnail sketch of the other cases decided last week.

The seven Iowa Supreme Court justices unanimously affirmed the new sentence for Ragland ordered by the district court: life with the possibility of parole after 25 years. Chief Justice Mark Cady wrote the majority ruling, which you can read here (pdf). After reviewing the facts of the case, Cady explains why the court found that the Miller ruling applies retroactively to Ragland, who had been convicted many years earlier. Excerpts:

Next, the justices considered “whether Ragland’s sentence, as commuted by the Governor, rendered Miller inapplicable to Ragland.” The state argued in its appeal that “the district court unconstitutionally intruded on the authority of the Governor by refusing to give effect to the commutation” (minimum 60 years before eligible for parole).

The majority ruling sidestepped the question of whether Branstad exceeded his authority with his mass commutation: “we do not believe it is necessary to traipse into this constitutional thicket.” However, case law cited on page 17 indicates that a governor “cannot use the commutation power to increase a defendant’s punishment.” Increasing the prison terms of the 38 lifers was Branstad’s explicit intent, so one could reasonably argue that he abused his commutation power.

In any event, the justices agreed with Ragland that he is serving a mandatory sentence. From pages 19-20:

As I mentioned above, all seven justices agreed with this outcome. Disagreements emerged in concurrences filed by three of the justices, though. Those are worth reading, beginning on page 26 of this pdf file. Justice David Wiggins almost invited future lawsuits challenging Branstad’s commutations with this shot across the bow.

Justice Edward Mansfield wasn’t having any of it in his special concurrence, beginning on page 29. He observed that the governor has the power to commute sentences at any time after a conviction, and that no court had removed Ragland’s life without parole sentence at the time of Branstad’s commutations.

Mansfield pointed to other state rulings that affirmed governors’ commutations to life without parole sentences after the death penalty had been ruled unconstitutional. He disagreed with Wiggins’ interpretation of state law, saying Iowa code allows prisoners to apply for commutations but “does not appear to limit the Governor’s authority to grant commutations.”

The third Branstad appointee from 2011, Bruce Zager, filed his own concurrence, which begins on page 29. He would affirm the district court’s resentencing of Ragland but for different reasons than those Cady outlined in the majority ruling. He agrees that having been convicted of a crime committed when he was a juvenile, Ragland deserved an “individualized assessment” at his sentencing hearing, “taking into consideration the appropriate factors, including age and other circumstances surrounding the crime.”

Zager was persuaded by Wiggins, at least in part:

None of these arguments are likely to influence Branstad. Judging from his spokesman’s comments to the Des Moines Register, he will focus on finding ways to keep all of these convicts in prison longer.

Leaving aside that skirmish over the governor’s commutation power, the Iowa Supreme Court justices largely agreed in the Ragland case. The other two cases decided last week divided the court 4-3.

Justice Brent Appel wrote the majority rulings in both State v. Null (pdf) and State v. Pearson (pdf).

At age 16, Denem Null shot and killed a man during a robbery. He was initially charged with first-degree murder but pled guilty to second-degree murder and first-degree robbery to avoid a mandatory life without parole sentence.

Concurrent sentences would allow Null to become eligible for parole sooner, but the judge ordered consecutive sentences, meaning 75 years in prison with the possibility of parole only after Null had completed at least 70 percent of the sentences (52.5 years).

Null’s attorney did raise the issue of his client’s age and difficult childhood during the sentencing hearing, so the judge had a chance to consider the individual circumstances of the case.

Null’s lawsuit challenged his convictions, claiming he had inadequate representation, but the Iowa Supreme Court rejected those arguments and affirmed his convictions.

The justices split over Null’s challenge to the length of his sentences. Appel summarized the main arguments on both sides (excerpts from pp 12-14):

On pages 15 to 49 of the decision, Appel discusses the changing jurisprudence in Iowa, other state and federal courts with respect to treatment of juveniles and what is considered cruel and unusual punishment. The majority applied those principles to Null’s case beginning on page 49.

Appel pre-empts some arguments against this reasoning.

First, we note that Miller emphasizes that nothing said in Roper, Graham, or Miller is “crime-specific.” […] Certainly the notions that juveniles have less-developed judgment, that juveniles are more susceptible to peer pressure, and that juveniles’ characters are not fully formed applies to this and any other case involving a juvenile defendant. Thus, the notions in Roper, Graham, and Miller that “children are different” and that they are categorically less culpable than adult offenders apply as fully in this case as in any other. […] Second, we believe that while a minimum of 52.5 years imprisonment is not technically a life-without-parole sentence, such a lengthy sentence imposed on a juvenile is sufficient to trigger Miller-type protections. Even if lesser sentences than life without parole might be less problematic, we do not regard the juvenile’s potential future release in his or her late sixties after a half century of incarceration sufficient to escape the rationales of Graham or Miller. The prospect of geriatric release, if one is to be afforded the opportunity for release at all, does not provide a “meaningful opportunity” to demonstrate the “maturity and rehabilitation” required to obtain release and reenter society as required by Graham. […] We recognize that the evidence in this case does not clearly establish that Null’s prison term is beyond his life expectancy. […] we do not believe the determination of whether the principles of Miller or Graham apply in a given case should turn on the niceties of epidemiology, genetic analysis, or actuarial sciences in determining precise mortality dates. In coming to this conclusion, we note the repeated emphasis of the Supreme Court in Roper, Graham, and Miller of the lessened culpability of juvenile offenders, how difficult it is to determine which juvenile offender is one of the very few that is irredeemable, and the importance of a “meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” […] We also note that in the flurry of legislative action that has taken place in the wake of Graham and Miller, many of the new statutes have allowed parole eligibility for juveniles sentenced to long prison terms for homicides to begin after fifteen or twenty-five years of incarceration. […] We conclude that Miller’s principles are fully applicable to a lengthy term-of-years sentence as was imposed in this case because an offender sentenced to a lengthy term-of-years sentence should not be worse off than an offender sentenced to life in prison without parole who has the benefit of an individualized hearing under Miller. We recognize that some courts have viewed Miller more narrowly, holding that it applies only to mandatory sentences of life without parole. […] We also recognize that some courts have held Miller does not apply where the lengthy sentence is the result of aggregate sentences.

After concluding that the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Miller applies to Null’s case, the majority considered

The majority remanded the case to district court, ordering that the parties be allowed to present new evidence at Null’s sentencing hearing. Finally, the Iowa Supreme Court gave a strong nudge to the district court judge:

Chief Justice Cady, Justice Wiggins, and Justice Daryl Hecht concurred with Appel’s decision. Justices Mansfield, Waterman, and Zager agreed only with affirming Null’s convictions and not with vacating his prison sentence.

Waterman joined Mansfield’s separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, which begins on page 63. Mansfield made a valid point that “relevant factors relating to Null’s youth were brought to light and considered” when the district court sentenced Null.

Mansfield expressed concern about the “additional and unnecessary uncertainty” created by the majority opinion in this case.

On pages 73 and 74, Mansfield argues that the majority did not sufficiently explain why they are relying on the Iowa Constitution and not just U.S. Supreme Court rulings on juvenile sentencing.

In his separate opinion, Zager similarly argued that Miller does not apply to Null’s case, because Null was sentenced to a term of years, not life in prison.

Zager also held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Null’s sentences to run consecutively rather than concurrently.

I am not an attorney, but the Null case strikes me as a very tough call. It doesn’t sound as if the district court attached a lot of weight to the defendant’s individual circumstances, but unlike the Ragland case, the judge at least heard about mitigating circumstances and had discretion in sentencing. There will always be judges who lean toward harsher sentences.

The third ruling handed down last week, State v. Pearson, was not as long as the Null decision but waded into similarly complicated waters.

As in Null’s case, prosecutors sought consecutive sentences for Pearson, while the defendant’s attorney argued for concurrent sentences.

Appel’s opinion for the majority summarizes what happened next:

Although Pearson wasn’t convicted of murder or sentenced to life in prison, the majority found that the principles of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Miller ruling applied to her case.

Justices Hecht and Wiggins concurred in Appel’s opinion. In a separate opinion to express his agreement with the majority, Chief Justice Cady called on all judges to consider “the changing landscape of juvenile justice” when “sentencing juvenile offenders as adults.”

In his dissenting opinion joined by Justices Waterman and Zager, Mansfield acknowledged that Pearson’s sentence was harsh, but observed,

Mansfield then accused the majority of rewriting the Graham and Miller cases.

As in the Null case, Mansfield argued that the majority did not adequately explain their reasoning.

Finally, Mansfield concluded that the district court’s sentence for Pearson was not “so grossly disproportionate to the crimes committed as to be unconstitutional [….].”

Zager filed a brief separate opinion noting his agreement with Mansfield’s dissent and emphasizing that he does not agree with applying Miller or Graham to juveniles who have received “lengthy term-of-years sentences, also sometimes described as de facto sentences of life without parole.”

I don’t see any logical reason for judges not to consider new research about adolescent brains when sentencing juveniles to potentially long stretches in prison. Why shouldn’t the same principles of Miller and Graham apply in cases where a life sentence is not on the table?

Commenting on the trio of Iowa Supreme Court rulings, Drake University law professor Robert Rigg told the Des Moines Register,

In Rigg’s opinion, even hundreds of requests for resentencing “spread across Iowa should not strain the court system.”

Omar Saddiqui Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, Florida, who was shot and killed by police, was reportedly a U.S. citizen born in the state of New York and his family is from Afghanistan, according to The Washington Post.

Mateen, who worked as a private security guard, made the two-hour trip to Orlando in a rented vehicle, according to CNN.

NBC News reports that Mateen pledged his support to the terrorist group ISIS and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a 911 call during the shooting.

Authorities are investigating the early Sunday morning shooting spree at Pulse as an act of terrorism, CNN reports.

The death toll makes it the worst mass shooting in United States history. The number of casualties had initially been estimated to be 20 early Sunday morning.

With many of the injured in critical condition, the death toll is expected to rise.

Mateen reportedly entered the club at about 2 a.m. with an assault-type rifle, handgun and possibly other hand-held devices, and then took hostages for about three hours until police storm the club, according to The Washington Post. The attack appears to have been ""organized and well-prepared,"" according to CNN.

Pulse has described itself as Orlando's ""hottest gay bar.""

The Orlando Sentinel reports that 29-year-old Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie entered Orlando's Pulse nightclub at 2 a.m. on Sunday during the club's popular Latin Saturday event. He was carrying an assault rifle, a handgun, and was reportedly wearing an explosive device. Police say the suspect exchanged gunfire with an officer working at the club,then went inside where he continued shooting and took a large number of hostages — over 300 people were in attendance at the club.

At around 5 a.m., a SWAT team used a ""controlled explosion"" to distract the shooter, allowing them to rescue hostages. There was then a ""tense"" shoot-out, during which a bullet struck an officer's Kevlar helmet, which Orlando Police Chief John Mina believes saved the officer's life. Mateen was shot dead just by the SWAT team before 6 a.m.

""Many were saved by the heroic efforts of the men and women of the OPD, the Orange County Sheriffs, Seminal County Sheriff's office,"" said Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer in a press conference.

Mina said police have not determined an exact number of casualties, but as of 11 a.m. Sunday, Orlando city officials have confirmed more than 50 people have died, making this the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

Approximately 53 injured people were taken to area hospitals, including Orlando Health, which now has a family information center.

""Tonight our community witnessed or experienced a very horrific crime,"" Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said in a statement.

The White House issued a statement, offering condolences and saying that both the president and vice president have asked to receive regular updates on the situation.

When asked if the gunman had connections to radical Islamic terrorism, FBI Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper said, ""We do have suggestions that individual has leanings towards that."" Authorities say there's no indication of future attacks in Florida or elsewhere in the United States, however, and believe Mateen was acting as a ""lone wolf"" shooter.

Update 6/12, 11:15 a.m.: Mateen's father, Mir Seddique, spoke with NBC News, arguing that his son's actions were not motivated by religious hatred.

""This has nothing to do with religion,"" he said. ""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.""

Although, presumably, he is not speaking from any position of knowledge of Mateen's plans.

Update 6/12, 12:08 p.m.: The Orlando Sentinel reports there is an urgent need for blood donations in the area.

""There is an urgent need for O Negative, O Positive and AB Plasma blood donors following a mass shooting in Orlando, Florida,"" OneBlood said in a news release. ""Dozens of people have been injured and taken to area hospitals. The need for blood continues.""

I finally had a chance to read through the rulings, which do not guarantee early release for any prisoner but could allow hundreds of Iowans to have their sentences reviewed, if they were convicted for crimes committed as minors.

Follow me after the jump for background and key points from the three rulings. Unfortunately, Governor Terry Branstad still seems to be missing the point of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that set all of these cases in motion.

In June 2012, a divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v Alabama (pdf) that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles convicted of murder are unconstitutional. The Miller decision potentially affected 38 Iowans serving life without parole sentences in state prisons, plus ten more Iowans doing time in other state prisons or federal prisons for crimes committed when they were under age 18.

Within weeks, the Iowa Court of Appeals ordered new sentencing for two prisoners serving mandatory life without parole sentences. Each had been convicted of crimes committed at age 17.

Looking to short-circuit the possible release of any convicted killer, Governor Branstad decided in July 2012 to commute the life without parole sentences “to life with the possibility of parole only after 60 years for the 38 people who were convicted of First Degree Murder while a juvenile.” I argued at the time that the governor’s action went against the spirit of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, because he did not consider the individual circumstances of any criminal affected by his actions. The majority in Miller called for greater discretion, not a one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing murderers who were under 18 at the time of their crimes. Branstad jumped to the conclusion that none of these 38 people could be rehabilitated and all deserved to stay in prison until at least their late 70s, if they lived that long.

One of the 38 was Jeffrey Ragland, who had been serving a mandatory life sentence for his involvement in a 1986 murder. Many years earlier, he had tried and failed to have that sentence reduced, on the grounds that he did not strike the blow that killed the murder victim. Last summer he went to court arguing that his new sentence requiring at least 60 years in prison before parole violated the constitutional principles outlined in Miller.

Side note: Ragland’s case illustrates how important it is to have a good attorney if you are ever accused of a crime. His three friends reached plea bargains with prosecutors and served far less time. In fact, the boy who struck the killing blow only served three years for second-degree murder before being paroled. Ragland refused to plead guilty, so was charged and convicted of first-degree murder (because he had started the fight that ended in a killing) and sentenced to life without any hope of parole.

Waterman joined Mansfield’s separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, which begins on page 63. Mansfield made a valid point that “relevant factors relating to Null’s youth were brought to light and considered” when the district court sentenced Null.

Mansfield expressed concern about the “additional and unnecessary uncertainty” created by the majority opinion in this case.

On pages 73 and 74, Mansfield argues that the majority did not sufficiently explain why they are relying on the Iowa Constitution and not just U.S. Supreme Court rulings on juvenile sentencing.

In his separate opinion, Zager similarly argued that Miller does not apply to Null’s case, because Null was sentenced to a term of years, not life in prison.

Zager also held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Null’s sentences to run consecutively rather than concurrently.

I am not an attorney, but the Null case strikes me as a very tough call. It doesn’t sound as if the district court attached a lot of weight to the defendant’s individual circumstances, but unlike the Ragland case, the judge at least heard about mitigating circumstances and had discretion in sentencing. There will always be judges who lean toward harsher sentences.

The third ruling handed down last week, State v. Pearson, was not as long as the Null decision but waded into similarly complicated waters.

As in Null’s case, prosecutors sought consecutive sentences for Pearson, while the defendant’s attorney argued for concurrent sentences.

Appel’s opinion for the majority summarizes what happened next:

Although Pearson wasn’t convicted of murder or sentenced to life in prison, the majority found that the principles of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Miller ruling applied to her case.

Justices Hecht and Wiggins concurred in Appel’s opinion. In a separate opinion to express his agreement with the majority, Chief Justice Cady called on all judges to consider “the changing landscape of juvenile justice” when “sentencing juvenile offenders as adults.”

In his dissenting opinion joined by Justices Waterman and Zager, Mansfield acknowledged that Pearson’s sentence was harsh, but observed,

Mansfield then accused the majority of rewriting the Graham and Miller cases.

As in the Null case, Mansfield argued that the majority did not adequately explain their reasoning.

Finally, Mansfield concluded that the district court’s sentence for Pearson was not “so grossly disproportionate to the crimes committed as to be unconstitutional [….].”

Zager filed a brief separate opinion noting his agreement with Mansfield’s dissent and emphasizing that he does not agree with applying Miller or Graham to juveniles who have received “lengthy term-of-years sentences, also sometimes described as de facto sentences of life without parole.”

I don’t see any logical reason for judges not to consider new research about adolescent brains when sentencing juveniles to potentially long stretches in prison. Why shouldn’t the same principles of Miller and Graham apply in cases where a life sentence is not on the table?

Commenting on the trio of Iowa Supreme Court rulings, Drake University law professor Robert Rigg told the Des Moines Register,

I finally had a chance to read through the rulings, which do not guarantee early release for any prisoner but could allow hundreds of Iowans to have their sentences reviewed, if they were convicted for crimes committed as minors.

Follow me after the jump for background and key points from the three rulings. Unfortunately, Governor Terry Branstad still seems to be missing the point of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that set all of these cases in motion.

In June 2012, a divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v Alabama (pdf) that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles convicted of murder are unconstitutional. The Miller decision potentially affected 38 Iowans serving life without parole sentences in state prisons, plus ten more Iowans doing time in other state prisons or federal prisons for crimes committed when they were under age 18.

Within weeks, the Iowa Court of Appeals ordered new sentencing for two prisoners serving mandatory life without parole sentences. Each had been convicted of crimes committed at age 17.

Looking to short-circuit the possible release of any convicted killer, Governor Branstad decided in July 2012 to commute the life without parole sentences “to life with the possibility of parole only after 60 years for the 38 people who were convicted of First Degree Murder while a juvenile.” I argued at the time that the governor’s action went against the spirit of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, because he did not consider the individual circumstances of any criminal affected by his actions. The majority in Miller called for greater discretion, not a one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing murderers who were under 18 at the time of their crimes. Branstad jumped to the conclusion that none of these 38 people could be rehabilitated and all deserved to stay in prison until at least their late 70s, if they lived that long.

One of the 38 was Jeffrey Ragland, who had been serving a mandatory life sentence for his involvement in a 1986 murder. Many years earlier, he had tried and failed to have that sentence reduced, on the grounds that he did not strike the blow that killed the murder victim. Last summer he went to court arguing that his new sentence requiring at least 60 years in prison before parole violated the constitutional principles outlined in Miller.

Side note: Ragland’s case illustrates how important it is to have a good attorney if you are ever accused of a crime. His three friends reached plea bargains with prosecutors and served far less time. In fact, the boy who struck the killing blow only served three years for second-degree murder before being paroled. Ragland refused to plead guilty, so was charged and convicted of first-degree murder (because he had started the fight that ended in a killing) and sentenced to life without any hope of parole. The letter the killer wrote in 2012, urging the district court to show leniency when resentencing Ragland, is one of the saddest things I have read lately (see pages 6-7 of this pdf file).

But the State of Iowa appealed that sentence to the Iowa Supreme Court. Ryan Koopmans paraphrases their arguments:

After reading the facts of the Ragland case, I would be embarrassed to be the state attorney arguing that Branstad’s actions were consistent with the Miller ruling. Here’s a prisoner who was convicted of murder even though he didn’t directly kill anyone, much less kill a person in a pre-meditated way. Neither the details of the crime nor his behavior in prison nor the support system in place for him post-parole were taken into account when Branstad issued his blanket commutation. Just let the guy rot in state custody until he’s 78 years old.

Anyway, in State v. Ragland, the Iowa Supreme Court was asked to decide whether a minimum 60-year sentence for a crime committed as a juvenile offers a “meaningful” opportunity for parole. Ryan Koopmans provided a thumbnail sketch of the other cases decided last week.

The seven Iowa Supreme Court justices unanimously affirmed the new sentence for Ragland ordered by the district court: life with the possibility of parole after 25 years. Chief Justice Mark Cady wrote the majority ruling, which you can read here (pdf). After reviewing the facts of the case, Cady explains why the court found that the Miller ruling applies retroactively to Ragland, who had been convicted many years earlier. Excerpts:

Next, the justices considered “whether Ragland’s sentence, as commuted by the Governor, rendered Miller inapplicable to Ragland.” The state argued in its appeal that “the district court unconstitutionally intruded on the authority of the Governor by refusing to give effect to the commutation” (minimum 60 years before eligible for parole).

The majority ruling sidestepped the question of whether Branstad exceeded his authority with his mass commutation: “we do not believe it is necessary to traipse into this constitutional thicket.” However, case law cited on page 17 indicates that a governor “cannot use the commutation power to increase a defendant’s punishment.” Increasing the prison terms of the 38 lifers was Branstad’s explicit intent, so one could reasonably argue that he abused his commutation power.

In any event, the justices agreed with Ragland that he is serving a mandatory sentence. From pages 19-20:

As I mentioned above, all seven justices agreed with this outcome. Disagreements emerged in concurrences filed by three of the justices, though. Those are worth reading, beginning on page 26 of this pdf file. Justice David Wiggins almost invited future lawsuits challenging Branstad’s commutations with this shot across the bow.

Justice Edward Mansfield wasn’t having any of it in his special concurrence, beginning on page 29. He observed that the governor has the power to commute sentences at any time after a conviction, and that no court had removed Ragland’s life without parole sentence at the time of Branstad’s commutations.

Mansfield pointed to other state rulings that affirmed governors’ commutations to life without parole sentences after the death penalty had been ruled unconstitutional. He disagreed with Wiggins’ interpretation of state law, saying Iowa code allows prisoners to apply for commutations but “does not appear to limit the Governor’s authority to grant commutations.”

The third Branstad appointee from 2011, Bruce Zager, filed his own concurrence, which begins on page 29. He would affirm the district court’s resentencing of Ragland but for different reasons than those Cady outlined in the majority ruling. He agrees that having been convicted of a crime committed when he was a juvenile, Ragland deserved an “individualized assessment” at his sentencing hearing, “taking into consideration the appropriate factors, including age and other circumstances surrounding the crime.”

Zager was persuaded by Wiggins, at least in part:

None of these arguments are likely to influence Branstad. Judging from his spokesman’s comments to the Des Moines Register, he will focus on finding ways to keep all of these convicts in prison longer.

Leaving aside that skirmish over the governor’s commutation power, the Iowa Supreme Court justices largely agreed in the Ragland case. The other two cases decided last week divided the court 4-3.

Justice Brent Appel wrote the majority rulings in both State v. Null (pdf) and State v. Pearson (pdf).

At age 16, Denem Null shot and killed a man during a robbery. He was initially charged with first-degree murder but pled guilty to second-degree murder and first-degree robbery to avoid a mandatory life without parole sentence.

Concurrent sentences would allow Null to become eligible for parole sooner, but the judge ordered consecutive sentences, meaning 75 years in prison with the possibility of parole only after Null had completed at least 70 percent of the sentences (52.5 years).

Null’s attorney did raise the issue of his client’s age and difficult childhood during the sentencing hearing, so the judge had a chance to consider the individual circumstances of the case.

Null’s lawsuit challenged his convictions, claiming he had inadequate representation, but the Iowa Supreme Court rejected those arguments and affirmed his convictions.

The justices split over Null’s challenge to the length of his sentences. Appel summarized the main arguments on both sides (excerpts from pp 12-14):

On pages 15 to 49 of the decision, Appel discusses the changing jurisprudence in Iowa, other state and federal courts with respect to treatment of juveniles and what is considered cruel and unusual punishment. The majority applied those principles to Null’s case beginning on page 49.

Appel pre-empts some arguments against this reasoning.

First, we note that Miller emphasizes that nothing said in Roper, Graham, or Miller is “crime-specific.” […] Certainly the notions that juveniles have less-developed judgment, that juveniles are more susceptible to peer pressure, and that juveniles’ characters are not fully formed applies to this and any other case involving a juvenile defendant. Thus, the notions in Roper, Graham, and Miller that “children are different” and that they are categorically less culpable than adult offenders apply as fully in this case as in any other. […] Second, we believe that while a minimum of 52.5 years imprisonment is not technically a life-without-parole sentence, such a lengthy sentence imposed on a juvenile is sufficient to trigger Miller-type protections. Even if lesser sentences than life without parole might be less problematic, we do not regard the juvenile’s potential future release in his or her late sixties after a half century of incarceration sufficient to escape the rationales of Graham or Miller. The prospect of geriatric release, if one is to be afforded the opportunity for release at all, does not provide a “meaningful opportunity” to demonstrate the “maturity and rehabilitation” required to obtain release and reenter society as required by Graham. […] We recognize that the evidence in this case does not clearly establish that Null’s prison term is beyond his life expectancy. […] we do not believe the determination of whether the principles of Miller or Graham apply in a given case should turn on the niceties of epidemiology, genetic analysis, or actuarial sciences in determining precise mortality dates. In coming to this conclusion, we note the repeated emphasis of the Supreme Court in Roper, Graham, and Miller of the lessened culpability of juvenile offenders, how difficult it is to determine which juvenile offender is one of the very few that is irredeemable, and the importance of a “meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.” […] We also note that in the flurry of legislative action that has taken place in the wake of Graham and Miller, many of the new statutes have allowed parole eligibility for juveniles sentenced to long prison terms for homicides to begin after fifteen or twenty-five years of incarceration. […] We conclude that Miller’s principles are fully applicable to a lengthy term-of-years sentence as was imposed in this case because an offender sentenced to a lengthy term-of-years sentence should not be worse off than an offender sentenced to life in prison without parole who has the benefit of an individualized hearing under Miller. We recognize that some courts have viewed Miller more narrowly, holding that it applies only to mandatory sentences of life without parole. […] We also recognize that some courts have held Miller does not apply where the lengthy sentence is the result of aggregate sentences.

After concluding that the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Miller applies to Null’s case, the majority considered

The shooter has been identified as Omar Saddiqui Mateen.

Sunday evening the City of Orlando started releasing the names of some of the people killed in the shooting, As of 11:15pm, eight people had been named, their ages ranging from 22 to 37 years old.

Late Sunday, officials started removing bodies from inside an Orlando nightclub where 50 people were shot and killed. Workers brought four bodies on stretchers out of club Pulse and loaded them into white vans. The action was repeated over and over.

The bodies were then taken to the Orange County Medical Examiner's office.

The Orlando mayor says of the 50 victims who died from the shooting at a gay nightclub, 39 were killed at the club and 11 people died at hospitals.

At a news conference Sunday afternoon police said 11 officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter at a gay Florida nightclub.

Also, officials say three deputy sheriffs actively engaged, and fired their weapons. They're relieved of duties pending an investigation. That's typical procedure in such cases.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina says the shooter was armed with an assault-type rifle, a handgun and some type of suspicious device. Police had said previously on Twitter that there was a ""controlled explosion"" at the scene of the shooting at Pulse Orlando. Mina says that noise was caused by a device intended to distract the shooter.

Ronald Hopper of the FBI says shooter Omar Mateen was 29 and an American citizen. He was not under surveillance at the time of the shooting. Hooper says Mateen purchased at least two firearms within the last week or so.

Hooper says some 911 calls involving the shooter and the massacre have become federal evidence. He says the conversations involved the Islamic State.

Hooper says the shooter in 2013 made inflammatory comments to co-workers , and that Mateen was interviewed twice. Hooper calls those interviews inconclusive. In 2014, Hooper says, officials found that Mateen had ties to an American suicide bomber. Hooper describes the contact as minimal; it did not constitute a threat at that time.

Two men who were in Club Pulse discussed the Sunday massacre in Facebook chats with The Associated Press. Orlando resident Brand White was shot. He says, ""We are dancing and all of a sudden it just started like a rolling thunder, loud and everything went black.""

The 30-year-old was with his cousin, who mentioned something about ""a guy with a bomb."" After that, White says, his memory is fuzzy; he said he doesn't recall leaving the club or who took him to the hospital. White was shot in the shoulder. He spoke to The AP as he was being monitored at a hospital. He said he received a blood transfusion.

His cousin was unaccounted for -- no one had heard from him as of 2:45 p.m.

Another man, Brett Rigas, says he and his partner were dancing when they heard shots. Rigas was shot in the arm and hid behind a bar. About five minutes later, authorities came in and told everyone to put their hands up and run out. Rigas said he saw bodies as he ran out.

President Barack Obama spoke Sunday afternoon from the White House saying the worst mass shooting in U.S. history is a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get a weapon that allows them to shoot people in a school, in a house of worship, a movie theater or a gay nightclub.

Obama says the United States has to decide if that is the ""country we want to be."" He says that doing nothing is a decision as well.

The President ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and federal buildings until sunset Thursday ""as a mark of respect for victims of the act of hatred and terror."" He's also directing the same observance at embassies and other U.S. government facilities abroad.

Police departments across the country are increasing patrols near locations frequented by the LGBT community after a gunman killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

In Los Angeles, the mayor says a heavily armed person who was headed to a gay pride parade had been arrested by Santa Monica police. Mayor Eric Garcetti says the arrest was completely unrelated to the Orlando nightclub shooting.

Officer Ernesto Rodriguez of Miami Beach Police Department says the agency is saddened by the massacre and out of an abundance of caution will step up patrols. Boston Pride organizers plan to hold a moment of silence at this weekend's scheduled block parties to honor the Orlando victims and police there said there will be a heavier presence at those events.

The Baltimore Police Department says it is reaching out to the city's LBGT community to discuss concerns and safety after the Orlando massacre.","Police say 50 people were killed inside pulse, a Florida nightclub, and at least 53 were wounded.

The call from Muslim leaders in Florida comes after a heavily armed gunman opened fire and seized hostages at a gay club in Orlando early Sunday, killing 50 people.

The attacker, who died during a shootout with police, has been named by American television networks as Afghan-American Omar Mateen from Port St Lucie in Florida.

CBS News quoted law enforcement sources, saying police are investigating whether he had ties to “Islamic extremism”. Police have not officially identified the gunman.

CNN and NBC cited law enforcement sources as saying that Mateen made a 911 phone call shortly before the shooting pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group.

But the suspect's father told NBC news his son may have been motivated by homophobia and not by his Muslim faith.

In the wake of the attack, a senior FBI official told Reuters that that there were suggestions that the gunman might have had leanings toward Islamic State militants but that this required further investigation.

""Do we consider this an act of terrorism? Absolutely, we are investigating this from all parties’ perspective as an act of terrorism,"" said Danny Banks, special agent in charge of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. ""Whether that is domestic terrorist activity or an international one, that is something we will certainly get to the bottom of.""

When asked if the FBI suspected the gunman might have had inclinations toward ""militant Islam,"" including possible sympathy with Islamic State, Ronald Hopper, an assistant FBI agent in charge, told reporters: ""We do have suggestions that the individual may have leanings toward that particular ideology. But right now we can’t say definitively.""

In the wake of the shooting, the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-FL) called on Muslim Americans to donate blood in the city and joined with interfaith leaders to condemn the deadly shooting spree.

""We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,” said CAIR-Florida's Orlando regional coordinator Rasha Mubarak.

Members of the American Muslim Community Centers in Orlando also expressed their shock and sadness at the “senseless killings”.

A spokesperson for the group said: ""AMCC and its members offer their deepest condolences to those affected by this tragedy and we stand with our fellow Americans in this difficult time.

""Ramadan is a month of deep reflection and prayer. Senseless violence has no place in our religion or in our society. We strongly condemn this heinous act of violence against humanity"". Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month, runs this year from 6 June to 5 July.

The chaotic events unfolded over a three-hour period, beginning at around 2 am (0600 GMT) when shots rang out amid the throbbing music at the Pulse Orlando nightclub near closing time.

Police said the shots were fired by a gunman armed with an assault rifle and a handgun.

A police officer working ""extra duties"" at the club responded, joined by two other officers, who engaged the suspect in a gun battle.

The suspect then went back inside the club and took hostages. Police then stormed the venue, using explosives and breaking through a wall with a wheeled armored vehicle known as a BearCat, killing the suspect in a blaze of gunfire, according to the police account.

The White House later said that President Barack Obama has been briefed by his homeland security and counterterrorism aide on the mass shooting.

Obama asked to receive regular updates on the unfolding investigation, and instructed the federal government to provide any assistance necessary, a statement said.

It was unclear whether all the victims were killed by the gunman or if some died in the ensuing shootout with police.

Speaking earlier to Sky News, clubber Ricardo Negron, who was inside when the shooting began, described how the gunman raked the club with bullets.

""People just dropped on the floor. I guess the shooter was shooting at the ceiling because you could see all the glass from the lamps falling,"" he told the network.

He described hearing ""non-stop firing"" which probably lasted less than a minute but felt like a lot longer.

""There was a brief pause in the shooting and some of us just got up and ran out the back.

""People have definitely been injured - or worse.""

Emergency vehicles swarmed the area, with at least one crisis command vehicle at the scene.

The Pulse club advertises itself online as ""Orlando's hottest gay bar"". On its Facebook page, the club warned patrons: ""Everyone get out Pulse and keep running.""

Witness Christopher Hanson said he heard ""loud banging noises, like gunshots going off"".

""I didn't see any of the actual shooters. I just saw bodies going down and I was ordering a drink at the bar.

""I fell down. I crawled out. People were trying to escape out the back. I just know that when I hit the ground I was crawling and I hit my elbows and my knees,"" he told CNN.

He said there was ""blood everywhere"".

Rosie Feba was at the club with a friend when the shooting broke out.

""She told me someone was shooting. Everyone was getting on the floor,"" Feba told the Orlando Sentinel. ""I told her I didn't think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.""

He previously worked as an advocate for the National Park System.

It’s more difficult to donate blood as a gay man in Florida than to buy an assault rifle with no questions asked. Following an attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando that killed 50 people and wounded scores of others last night, Mic and others reported that blood bank OneBlood would be “accepting all donors” — crucially, including gay men. That’s a big deal, since the official recommendation of the federal Food and Drug Administration is to turn away gay men from blood donations if they’ve had sex in the past year. However, the blood bank later said those reports were false, and that “all FDA guidelines remain in effect.”

The FDA only lifted the total recommended ban on donations from gay men last December, after the policy has been in place since 1983, when the AIDS epidemic was becoming a national panic. “We have taken great care to ensure this policy revision is backed by sound science and continues to protect our blood supply,” the FDA’s acting commissioner said at the time. Still, the new guidance is discriminatory — and immensely hurtful to survivors who are unable to help their own community after being attacked.

The 12-month limit on donations from gay men is an international standard, but it will still prevent lots of men from donating blood. However, the FDA’s policy is guidance that local and private bodies aren’t required to follow. As The Washington Post reported, the blood bank’s guidelines haven’t even caught up to the FDA’s most recent standard, meaning it’s still turning away all gay men from donating.

Update June 13th 1:15PM ET: This story has been updated to reflect new comments from OneBlood, refuting the interpretation of earlier reports, and comments it made on Facebook. The blood bank says “all FDA guidelines remain in effect for blood donation.” We have reached out to OneBlood for further clarification.","The Verge is about technology and how it makes us feel.

And while this provides an unprecedented level of access to information, it also makes us one of the most technologically-vulnerable countries in the world and exposes us to possible cyber-attacks. In fact, at this very moment, there are hackers across the globe working to find weaknesses in the digital systems that help run critical infrastructure like the electric grid that we rely on to power our daily lives.

A successful cyber-attack on the grid or other American infrastructure could have catastrophic consequences for our country. That’s why we need to take proactive steps to safeguard against these threats.

From my position on the Senate Intelligence Committee, I’ve heard testimony from top security officials outlining how critical infrastructure like the energy grid are desirable targets for bad actors like hackers, terror groups, or foreign countries hoping to attack the Unites States. These same officials have also warned that, without action, we remain vulnerable to cyber-attacks that could result in terrible damage to our public health and safety, economic security, and national security.

To see the potential dangers of this type of cyber-attack, look no further than an incident in December 2015 that left more than 225,000 Ukrainians in darkness. That sophisticated cyber-attack was coordinated to target the industrial control systems within Ukraine’s power grid, which act as the intermediary between the grid’s computers and the switches that actually distribute electricity.

Ironically, the hackers behind the attack in Ukraine might have caused even more damage if not for the fact that the Ukrainians still used older, manual technology to operate their grid. So believe it or not, the future of securing our grid could actually be found in the past.

In order to build on this approach of using “retro” technology to shore up our energy grid cyber-defenses and protect us from potential attacks, I introduced a bipartisan bill this week that would examine possible solutions that replace key automated devices that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks with analog and human-operated systems.

This bill, the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act of 2016, seeks to thwart even the most determined and sophisticated cyber-adversaries. By adding these safeguards, we could make it much more difficult for hackers to attack the grid remotely.

A bipartisan group of senators has joined me on this legislation, including Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. Each of these senators serve with me on the Intelligence Committee, and they know just how pressing this issue is for the safety and security of our country. By aiming to reengineer the so-called “last-mile” of the energy grid, our bill would enlist the assistance of top national security experts and the energy industry to study ways to isolate its most important systems, add manual safeguards, and help defend our energy infrastructure from a devastating blow that could cut off electricity to millions of people across the United States.

In the digital age, cyber-space is a new battlefront and we need to be prepared for the day that our adversaries will try to use our technological advances against us. As demonstrated recently in Ukraine, that day could be tomorrow. We must meet that threat head on – and do so without delay.

So when the community was targeted in the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history today, it was a worry for the community and its allies. Fifty people have been killed in the massacre which took place in the early hours of this morning at Pulse, one of Orlando’s most popular gay clubs. Many more are injured, and hospitals are reporting blood shortages as they struggle to save lives.

But Americans were quick to to turn their horror into action. Many in Florida rushed to donate blood for those wounded in the deadly attack, and in some states more than 600 people were queuing to help.

Among those appealing for assistance was the Council for Islamic American Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy group in the U.S. In an announcement released hours after the news, it urged members to donate blood to help the victims of the attack.

CAIR joined other members of the Florida community for an interfaith response today, joining with other faith groups to condemn the shooting.

The gunman has been announced as Omar Mateen, an 29-year-old Afghan-American from Florida. His heritage immediately sparked fears of an Islamophobic backlash at a time when anti-Muslim bigotry in the US is already high. The attack has been classified as a terrorist incident.

Mateen was reportedly known to U.S. security officials before the attack, but not under investigation at the time. His father hypothesized that his son's outrage at seeing two men kissing in Miami months before the attack may have motivated him, and condemned his son's actions.

Local Muslim groups joined CAIR in condemning the attacks and expressing support for the victims.

Mateen was killed in a shoot-out with police during the incident.

About 20 people died and 42 were injured in a shooting and hostage-taking early Sunday at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, police said.



The FBI, who is assisting the investigation by Orlando police, said it was treating the attack as an act of ""domestic terrorism"" and that the deceased shooter ""may have leanings toward"" radical Islam.



The incident at the Pulse nightclub in the centre of Orlando began at 2 am (0600 GMT) when a police officer posted outside the building confronted the shooter, who then opened fire, police chief John Mina said.



The gunman - who Mina said was carrying an assault rife, a handgun and ""some sort of device"" on his body - then moved inside the club and took hostages.



Mina described him as ""organized and well-prepared."" Police said the shooter was not from the Orlando area and they were still trying to determine a motive for the killings.



SWAT teams stormed the club three hours later, at 5 am, after phone calls from some of the 15 people who said they were hiding inside one of the club's bathrooms.



The shooter then died in a gunfight with officers.



The police chief said 30 people were rescued from inside the club.



About 20 clubgoers were found dead inside the building, Mina said, but cautioned that police don't yet have an exact number for those killed as the club was still being cleared of ""devices.""



A loud explosion heard around 5 am was a ""controlled explosion,"" police said.



The injured were transported to three area hospitals.



Nine officers were involved in the gun battle. One officer was injured in the eye, but not seriously, Mina said.



""Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running,"" the club wrote on its Facebook page after the attack began.



Anthony Torres, who was at Pulse for a Latin-themed night, told CNN that the ""shots did not sound like a regular handgun, it sounded like it was shooting repetitively and it wouldn't stop.""","Mateen was killed in a shoot-out with police, and the FBI has said it was treating the attack as an act of ""domestic terrorism."""

They also expressed alarm that uniformed soldiers appeared at ease booing his political opponents—another troubling breach of military norms. Some now say the time has come for generals to publicly speak out.

The commander in chief entered the event to “Hail to the Chief,” and as he took to the stage, his “MAGA anthem,” “Proud to Be an American,” played. For nearly one hour, in about 9,000 words, Trump delivered a political stump speech. He attacked his political opposition, Democrats, including President Joe Biden and his administration, California Governor Gavin Newsom (“Newscum”) and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass. He attacked transgender Americans. He attacked the Democratic U.S. Senators who opposed the nomination of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, calling them “a very hostile group of people that I think really don’t want to see America be great again.”

He got the soldiers to boo “the fake news” media, and President Joe Biden. He told them the 2020 election was “rigged and stolen.”

He attacked the people in Los Angeles protesting his deportation policies, describing it as “anarchy,” while telling the soldiers that defending their civil rights was not the reason Americans fought overseas:

“Generations of army heroes did not shed their blood on distant shores only to watch our country be destroyed by invasion and third world lawlessness here at home like is happening in California. As Commander in chief, I will not let that happen. It’s never going to happen. What you’re witnessing in California is a full-blown assault on peace, on public order and on national sovereignty carried out by rioters bearing foreign flags with the aim of continuing a foreign invasion of our country.”

He thanked the generals, and mentioned some by name. He talked about “the real generals,” as opposed to the ones Americans see on television.

“This is the most unacceptable and egregious politicization of our troops we’ve ever seen,” wrote veterans’ activist Paul Rieckhoff, an Army combat veteran, responding to video of Trump getting the soldiers to boo the press, President Joe Biden, and the mayor of Los Angeles.

“And it’s not a one off. It’s a strategy,” added Rieckhoff, who is also the founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). “And one we’ll see in full and dangerous display this weekend at his military birthday parade for himself. Trump wants the world to think our great military is HIS military. And wants to coerce and manipulate troops into making them think it is too. And driving down their public trust and approval by the minute. Trump has created America’s greatest civil-military relations crisis since the Civil War. And it’s just getting started.”

Retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel Alexander Vindman, a former Director of European Affairs for the National Security Council (NSC), warned: “America’s Generals and Admirals are terrified. They are cowed. They seem unlikely to hold the line and live up to their oaths to serve the U.S. Constitution.”

Lamenting that “the Generals stay silent,” he added: “Our democracy is in great danger. This morning I wonder if we crossed a line and there’s no going back.”

Army combat veteran Fred Wellman, a graduate of West Point and the Harvard Kennedy School who is now the host of the podcast “On Democracy.” responded to Vindman by saying, “The silence is deafening.”

Retired U.S Army lieutenant general Russel L. Honoré, who served as the commander of Joint Task Force Katrina, blasted Trump’s speech: “Damn @POTUS Speech At #FortBragg was inappropriate, criticizing previous administration, and Generals while speaking to troops , I never witnessed that S..t like this in 37 years in Uniform.”

Author and former Under Secretary of State Richard Stengel observed, “Unlike other militaries, American soldiers do not swear an oath to the state, or a person, or a monarch, but to the Constitution. Trump calls them ‘his’ military—but they are ours, and they swear to ‘support and defend the Constitution,’ not one man.”

Tom Nichols, a retired U.S. Naval War College professor and Russia expert, at The Atlantic targeted the generals for staying silent.

He wrote, “senior officers of the United States military have an obligation to speak up and be leaders. Where is the Army chief of staff, General Randy George? Will he speak truth to the commander in chief and put a stop to the assault on the integrity of his troops? Where is the commander of the airborne troops, Lieutenant General Gregory Anderson, or even Colonel Chad Mixon, the base commander?”

“Where is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dan Caine? He was personally selected by Trump to be America’s most senior military officer. Will he tell the man who promoted him that what he did today was obscene?”

Retired U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey, often seen on cable news, called Trump’s speech “a disgraceful politicization of the active Armed Forces. He is the Commander in Chief. The only loyalty of the Armed Forces is to the Constitution. Their focus is on protecting America from foreign enemies. Grave danger.”

Orlando police say 50 people died in what is being investigated as a terror attack at a nightclub Saturday night. It is the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

The gunman opened fire at Pulse Nightclub, a gay establishment in Orlando, Florida, and took hostages for three hours until officers who were able to rescue people. The gunman was killed in an exchange of gunfire.

The Washington Post reports that family and law authorities have identified the shooter as 29-year-old Omar Mateen of Fort Pierce, Florida. U.S law officials are now saying that he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before the attack.

The president said in an afternoon press conference that investigators don’t know if he has affiliation with other terrorists or what exactly his motivation was although he emphasized “what is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred.”

The president described the Pulse nightclub as more than a nightclub. He said it was a place of “solidarity and encouragement” for the Orlando LGBT community.

He also cited the first responders to the massacre, saying that their courage and professionalism saved lives.

In a 911 call made before the attack Mateen identified himself and pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, reports the The Washington Post. During that call Mateen also made reference to 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon, officials said.

Law enforcement officials told ABC News they have been aware of Marteen for some time, but he's not been the subject of a specific investigation. Mateen is an American citizen, but his family is reportedly from Afghanistan.

“We are apologizing for the whole incident,” his father told NBC News. ““We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.”

Fox News reports Mateen is a security officer who is licensed to carry arms in the state and has boasted of having links to Islamic terrorist groups.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said it appeared the gunman was armed with “a handgun and an AR-15-type assault rifle” and had additional rounds on him.

NBC News says Mateen's father claims the attack has ""nothing to with religion"" and his son was angry after seeing two men kissing.

Danny Banks, Special Agent in Charge for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said the investigation is being treated as a possible act of terrorism, whether domestic or international. The attack is also being investigated as a possible hate crime against the gay community.

Orange Conty Sherrif Jerry Demings said the incident is something ""we certainly classify as domestic terror incident.""

“We’re dealing with something we never imagined and is unimaginable,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer (D) said during a news briefing Sunday.

In an earlier statement, Florida Governonr Rick Scott said this attack was not only againist Orlando, but the United States.

“This is clearly an act of terror that happened in Orlando this morning. It sickens me and makes me angry"", said Scott. ""Of course, this is a time of great tragedy, and in every tragedy, there is a flood of sadness, confusion and despair. But, this is an attack on our people. An attack on Orlando. An attack on Florida. An attack on America. An attack on all of us.""

The head of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, appearing at a press conference with law enforcement and Orlando city officials, called on ""everybody in the community, anybody who has any information, to please call the FBI.""

He also called on the media to refrain from a rush to judgment about motive until authorities have more information.

However, people are using social media to offer their condolences to the victims and their family members.

Governor Rick Scott also tweeted and asked the nation to pause for a moment of silence Sunday evening.

The City of Orlando has released the names of four victims in the shooting, including Edward Sotomayor Jr., Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, and Juan Ramon Guerrero.

""On this very difficult day, we offer heartfelt condolences to today’s victims and their families"", read the city's website. ""Our City is working tirelessly to get as much information out to the families so they can begin the grieving process.

Barbano was able to get out the back of the club. He ran to the front of the building to help until the paramedics arrived.

The shooter carried out the worst mass shooting in U.S. history when he opened fire inside a crowded Florida nightclub early Sunday, gunning down at least 50 people and wounding another 53. He was later killed in a shootout with police. Here’s what we know about him so far:

What did he do?

Mateen shot into a crowd of hundreds of people inside Pulse Orlando, a popular gay nightclub, where he held people hostage, about 2 a.m. on Sunday, police said. He was armed with an assault rifle and a handgun and also had a “suspicious device,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina said. Mateen was killed during a gun battle with police about 5 a.m. when a SWAT team entered the club to rescue the hostages, authorities said.

Who was he?

Mateen, who had reportedly made calls to 911 early Sunday stating his allegiance to ISIS, was flagged on the FBI’s radar in 2013 and then again in 2014, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper said at a news conference. Both investigations were closed after inconclusive interviews.

The agency questioned Mateen twice after being alerted to him speaking of possible terrorist ties in 2013 but officials were “unable to verify the substance of his comments.” The 29-year-old came to the FBI’s attention again in the next year over possible ties to an American suicide bomber, Hopper said.

The FBI closed that investigation after authorities determined that contact between the two were minimal. Mateen did not pose as a threat at that time, Hopper said.

Mateen is a U.S. citizen who was born in New York and later moved to Port St. Lucie, Florida, authorities said. He was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of the Orlando nightclub massacre, according to the FBI. Mateen had legally purchased at least two firearms—a handgun and a long gun— within the last week, the ATF said.

A security company, G4S, said in a statement Sunday that Mateen had been employed there since 2007, adding that it was “deeply shocked” by the shooting. “We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities,” the company said.

Mateen worked at a gated retirement community in South Florida for G4S. He passed the company’s screening and background checks in 2007 and again 2013 when his employers learned he had been questioned by the FBI, according to the company’s spokeswoman, Monica Lewman-Garcia.

“We were not made aware of any alleged connections between Mateen and terrorist activities,” the statement said. “Our thoughts and prayers remain with the victims of this unspeakable tragedy, and their friends and families.”

What was his motive?

Little is known so far on what prompted Mateen to attack the nightclub, and the shooting is under investigation. The assault was “more likely than not ideologically motivated,” Grayson said. “It’s no coincidence that the attack took place where it did and where it did,” he added.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying the attack was “carried out by an Islamic State fighter” in a report on its official Amaq news agency. According to NBC News, Mateen not only pledged allegiance to ISIS when he called 911 before the shooting, but also mentioned the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and two brothers who carried it out.

Mateen’s motive was also a mystery to his father, Mir Seddique, who told NBC News that the shooting had “nothing to do with religion” and may have been sparked by an earlier incident that involved gay men. Seddique said his son got angry a couple of months ago when he saw two men kissing in Miami, according to NBC.

“I apologize for what my son did. I don’t know why he did it. He is dead, so I can’t ask him. I wish I knew,” he said. “We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.”

According to the Washington Post, Seddique has been identified as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban in his YouTube videos.

Mateen’s ex-wife described Mateen as an abusive man in an interview with the Post, adding that she didn’t know him to be very religious and that he worked out frequently. “He was not a stable person,” said the ex-wife, who was not named. “He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.” The two met online about eight years ago, according to the newspaper.

Yusufiy’s family had to “rescue” her from the abuse, she said Sunday at a news conference, according to CNN. “[My family] had to pull me out of his arms and find an emergency flight,” she recalled.

Syed Shafeeq Rahman, the iman of the Fort Pierce mosque where Mateen worshipped, said he attended prayer three to four times per week and never demonstrated any violent capabilities, Agence-France Presse reports. After services, he wouldn’t socialize, but would smile and shake hands, the iman said.

However, the New York Times reports that a former co-worker said that Mateen “talked about killing people all the time.” Daniel Gilroy, who worked at the GS4 security company with Mateen, told the Times that Mateen “was just agitated about everything, always shaken, always agitated, always mad.”","Omar Mateen was angered when he saw two men kissing, his father said"

Orlando police say 50 people died in what is being investigated as a terror attack at a nightclub Saturday night. It is the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

The gunman opened fire at Pulse Nightclub, a gay establishment in Orlando, Florida, and took hostages for three hours until officers who were able to rescue people. The gunman was killed in an exchange of gunfire.

The Washington Post reports that family and law authorities have identified the shooter as 29-year-old Omar Mateen of Fort Pierce, Florida. U.S law officials are now saying that he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before the attack.

The president said in an afternoon press conference that investigators don’t know if he has affiliation with other terrorists or what exactly his motivation was although he emphasized “what is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred.”

The president described the Pulse nightclub as more than a nightclub. He said it was a place of “solidarity and encouragement” for the Orlando LGBT community.

He also cited the first responders to the massacre, saying that their courage and professionalism saved lives.

In a 911 call made before the attack Mateen identified himself and pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, reports the The Washington Post. During that call Mateen also made reference to 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon, officials said.

Law enforcement officials told ABC News they have been aware of Marteen for some time, but he's not been the subject of a specific investigation. Mateen is an American citizen, but his family is reportedly from Afghanistan.

“We are apologizing for the whole incident,” his father told NBC News. ““We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.”

Fox News reports Mateen is a security officer who is licensed to carry arms in the state and has boasted of having links to Islamic terrorist groups.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said it appeared the gunman was armed with “a handgun and an AR-15-type assault rifle” and had additional rounds on him.

NBC News says Mateen's father claims the attack has ""nothing to with religion"" and his son was angry after seeing two men kissing.

Danny Banks, Special Agent in Charge for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said the investigation is being treated as a possible act of terrorism, whether domestic or international. The attack is also being investigated as a possible hate crime against the gay community.

Orange Conty Sherrif Jerry Demings said the incident is something ""we certainly classify as domestic terror incident.""

“We’re dealing with something we never imagined and is unimaginable,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer (D) said during a news briefing Sunday.

In an earlier statement, Florida Governonr Rick Scott said this attack was not only againist Orlando, but the United States.

“This is clearly an act of terror that happened in Orlando this morning. It sickens me and makes me angry"", said Scott. ""Of course, this is a time of great tragedy, and in every tragedy, there is a flood of sadness, confusion and despair. But, this is an attack on our people. An attack on Orlando. An attack on Florida. An attack on America. An attack on all of us.""

The head of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, appearing at a press conference with law enforcement and Orlando city officials, called on ""everybody in the community, anybody who has any information, to please call the FBI.""

He also called on the media to refrain from a rush to judgment about motive until authorities have more information.

However, people are using social media to offer their condolences to the victims and their family members.

Governor Rick Scott also tweeted and asked the nation to pause for a moment of silence Sunday evening.

The City of Orlando has released the names of four victims in the shooting, including Edward Sotomayor Jr., Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, and Juan Ramon Guerrero.

""On this very difficult day, we offer heartfelt condolences to today’s victims and their families"", read the city's website. ""Our City is working tirelessly to get as much information out to the families so they can begin the grieving process. Please keep the following individuals in your thoughts and prayers. #PrayforOrlando""

Survivors say the attack began around 2 am as 100-plus people began to exit the establishment.

""The main dance floor was already kind of clearing out as people we were going to the bars paying off their tabs,"" Luis Barbano told ABC News. ""(He) used the sliding glass door to get to where we were at. And then that was it"".

Jon Alamo said he heard shots coming from the front room.

Everyone in the building got on the ground, some people crawled toward the DJ booth, and others were able to escape out of the back door after a club bouncer knocked down a partition between the club area and a back room for employees.

Christopher Hansen said he was in the VIP lounge when he heard the gunshots.

""I was thinking, 'Are you kidding me?' So I just dropped down. I just said, 'Please, please, please, I want to make it out,'"" he said. ""And when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood. You hope and pray you don't get shot.""

Barbano was able to get out the back of the club. He ran to the front of the building to help until the paramedics arrived.

""You either run or make something happen to save as many as you can, "" he said.

""We heard a controlled explosion hours later and then we heard two more explosions and then we heard gunshots followed by a take-down,"" he explained. ""At the point the officer, right next to us, told us to 'duck, duck, duck'.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama decried the deadliest mass shooting in American history on Sunday as a terrorist act targeting a place of ""solidarity and empowerment"" for gays and lesbians. He urged Americans to decide ""if that's the kind of country we want to be.""

Hours after a gunman killed at least 50 people in Orlando, Obama said the FBI would investigate the nightclub shooting as terrorism, but said the alleged shooter's motivations were unclear. He said the U.S. ""must spare no effort"" to determine whether the suspect, identified by authorities as Omar Mateen, had any ties to extremist groups.

""What is clear is he was a person filled with hatred,"" Obama said of the alleged shooter. He added: ""We know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.""

Obama had planned to travel to Wisconsin on Wednesday for his first campaign appearance of the 2016 race, a joint rally with Hillary Clinton in Green Bay, Wisconsin. But Clinton's campaign and the White House said that event was being postponed in light of the attack.

The president, who has proclaimed June as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, called the attack ""heartbreaking"" for the LGBT community. He said the site of the shooting was more than a nightclub because it was a place where people came ""to raise awareness, to speak their minds and to advocate for their civil rights.""

""The shooter targeted a night club where people came together to be with friends to dance and to sing — to live,"" Obama said.

For Obama, the hastily arranged remarks were the latest in what's become a tragically familiar routine. Since he took office in 2009, Obama has appeared before cameras more than a dozen times following mass shootings and issued written statements after many others.

The president made no new, specific call for stricter gun laws. Though he lamented ""how easy it is"" for people to get their hands on weapons, Obama appeared resigned to the likelihood that he'll be unable as president to substantially address the mass shootings that have proliferated in recent years.

""We have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be,"" Obama said. ""To actively do nothing is a decision as well.""

After a gunman in Newtown killed 20 first graders and six adults in 2012, Obama dedicated much of the start of his second term to pushing legislation to expand background checks, ban certain assault-style weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips. That measure collapsed in the Senate, and since then, the political makeup of Congress have made new gun laws appear out of reach. Still, Obama has sought to take incremental steps using his own authority to tighten rules for obtaining a gun.

Obama spoke from the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, named after the former press secretary who was shot and permanently disabled in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.

He also signed a proclamation on Sunday ordering flags to be flown at half-staff until sunset on Thursday in honor of the victims.

Vice President Joe Biden canceled a planned trip Sunday to Miami to hold a fundraiser for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. Biden's office said he would remain at his family home in Delaware while receiving updates about the shooting before returning to Washington in the evening.

A gunman opened fire and took hostages at the popular nightclub, Pulse Orlando, at about 2 a.m. before being killed in a gun battle with authorities. The FBI says the attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism.

President Barack Obama was briefed about the shooting early Sunday and has directed federal officials to provide “any necessary assistance to pursue the investigation and support the community,” Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims,” the statement said. Vice President Joe Biden also sent his condolences and is “closely monitoring the situation,” his spokesperson said in a statement.

Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also responded to the tragedy. “Woke up to hear the devastating news from FL,” Clinton wrote on Twitter. “As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act.”

In an interview with Chuck Todd on NBC News’ Meet the Press, Sen. Bernie Sanders condemned the attack. “Oh, it’s horrific, it’s unthinkable,” he said. “And just hopes go out to all those who were shot that they can recover.”

Trump alerted his supporters on Twitter to a “really bad shooting in Orlando.” “Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded,” he tweeted.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott offered his condolences and said “every resource” is available for assistance efforts. “My prayers are with the victims’ families & all those affected by the shooting in Orlando,” he tweeted. Condolences also came from House Speaker Paul Ryan and Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio also said “prayers are with those injured and killed” in the “horrifying act of terror in Orlando.”

Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy slammed Congress in the wake of the shootings. “Congress has become complicit in these murders by its total, unconscionable deafening silence,” he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Governor of Texas Dan Patrick, who is known for his conservative views, came under fire for tweeting a Bible passage after the shooting that read: “Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.” The post was deleted and was not written in response to the Orlando tragedy, Patrick’s advisor Allen Blakemore said in a statement.

“Lt. Governor Patrick and every Texan is stunned and saddened by the outrageous act of domestic terrorism that has occurred in Orlando,” Blakemore said, adding that the specific tweet was scheduled to go up on Sunday after being drafted last week. “We regret the unfortunate timing of these posts and ask everyone to join us in praying for the people of Orlando in this awful time.”",At least 20 people were killed and 42 others were wounded

The Lt. Gov. sent the tweet at approximately 7 a.m. The tweet was subsequently deleted at about 11:30 a.m.

Approximately one hour later, the Texas Lt. Governor tweeted “Have a Blessed Sunday!” which included a verse from Psalms in the Bible – “The Salvation of the Righteous Comes From the Lord; He is Their Stronghold in Time of Trouble.”:

Frank Gaffney of Breibart News reported that at 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, a U.S. citizen born from Afghan parents, opened fire in the Pulse club with an automatic weapon. He killed at least 50 persons and also wounded over 50. Early reports said that the FBI suspects that the shooter may have “leanings towards radical Islamic terrorism.”

As reported by Breitbart News, authorities are saying that the assault at the Florida gay nightclub has resulted in the highest body count from a terror attack on American soil since 9/11/01.

Mir Seddique, the father of suspected Omar Mateen told NBC that “This had nothing to do with religion.” As reported by Breitbart News, Mateen’s father added that his son had gotten angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami a couple of months ago and that he thought that may “caused this.”

Following news reports and criticisms of Patrick’s tweet, the Lt. Governor responded to questions about the posting through his political consultant, Allen Blakemore:

Lt. Governor Patrick and every Texan is stunned and saddened by the outrageous act of domestic terrorism that has occurred in Orlando. He and Jan are praying for the victims, their families and their friends. Regarding this morning’s scripture posting on social media, be assured that the post was not done in response to last night’s tragedy. The post was designed and scheduled last Thursday. The Lt. Governor is traveling out of the country, but our social media team has deleted the posts and graphics. We regret the unfortunate timing of these posts and ask everyone to join us in praying for the people of Orlando in this awful time.

Time Warner News’ Political Reporter David Cawton tweeted “Most pre-scheduled posts have the caption “Have a blessed Sunday”, at least recently. The tweet in ? did not.”

Postings and comments about the Lt. Governor’s tweet were number 5 on Facebook’s trending list as of 1:45 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. The response on Twitter has been mostly harsh and critical.

As noted prior to Patrick’s official response, Texas politicians frequently tweet Bible verses and other spiritual messages on Sunday morning.

Omar Mateen, 29, is believed to have specifically targeted the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, after seeing two men kissing in another city

An 'Islamic extremist' gunman killed 50 people and injured 53 others today after storming a gay nightclub in Florida in a suspected act of terrorism.

The attacker, identified as Omar Mateen, entered Orlando's Pulse club shortly before 2am local time (6am GMT), where hundreds of revellers were partying.

Armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, he then took terrified victims hostage before opening fire, showering the venue in a hail of bullets.

So far, we know a number of details about the shooter - he was a 29-year-old US citizen who lived in Port St Lucie, 125 miles away from Orlando.

He is believed to have been part of the radical Islam movement, but apparently was not on a terrorism watchlist at the time of today's shooting.

However, the suspect - who was shot dead in the attack - was reportedly being investigated over an unrelated crime, the details of which remain unclear.

When asked if Mateen had a link to radical Islamic terrorism, FBI agent Ron Hopper told journalists there were 'suggestions' he had 'leanings towards that'.

A congressman later said the attack is believed to have been 'ISIS-related'.

Detectives are investigating the background of the gunman, who is thought to have specifically targeted a gay club after seeing two men kissing in another city.

According to TMZ, Mateen, whose parents are both Afghan, possessed a Florida security officer licence and a state firearms licence.

Photos show the suspect posing in a couple of New York Police Department (NYPD) T-shirts, but the force said these were unofficial items he likely bought from a shop.

This afternoon, Mateen's dad apologised for his son’s actions, saying he believed he carried out the killings after seeing two gay men kissing in Miami two months ago.

What we know about Omar Mateen so far
• He was a 29-year-old US citizen who lived in Port St Lucie
• He is believed to have been part of the radical Islam movement
• He apparently was not on a terrorism watchlist
• However, he was being investigated over an unrelated crime
• His parents are both Afghan
• He is thought to have specifically targeted a gay club after seeing two men kissing in Miami two months ago

Speaking to NBC News, he said: “We are saying we are apologising for the whole incident.

“We were not aware of the actions he was taking.

“We are in shock like the whole of the country.

“This had nothing to do with religion.”

Earlier today, an Islamic State-affiliated Twitter account posted a photo it claimed to be of Mateen.

Accounts linked to the terror group were also seen celebrating the attack, which left dozens of unsuspecting revellers injured - some critically.

An ISIS twitter account showed a number of pictures of gay men being killed by the terror group.

The group also used a hashtag with the word Pulse, and said it would 'slay everyone of you o disbeliever'.

Mateen was apparently well-prepared for today's attack, carrying the assault rifle, a handgun and at least one suspicious device - believed to be a suicide vest.

During a press conference this afternoon, police confirmed that 50 people were killed in the slaying, while at least 53 others were injured.

This makes the attack the deadliest mass shooting in American history, eclipsing the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech university, which left 32 dead.

Medics described some of those injured at Pulse this morning as being in a critical condition, sparking fears the death toll could increase even further.

The killer was seen carrying a suspicious device during the shooting at the club, which has operated in downtown Orlando since 2004.

Three hours after the attack started, a squad of officers stormed the venue and shot dead Mateen, police said. It was unclear when he shot his victims.

""Do we consider this an act of terrorism? Absolutely, we are investigating this from all parties' perspective as an act of terrorism,"" said Danny Banks, special agent in charge of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

""Whether that is domestic terrorist activity or an international one, that is something we will certainly get to the bottom of.""

This afternoon, the mayor of Orlando said 'we are dealing with something we never imagined' and confirmed a state of emergency has been issued across the city.

Mayor Buddy Dyer added that the identification of the victims may take some time.

""I continue to be proud of how our community has responded. 7/7 #PrayforOrlando,"" he tweeted.

Maten took dozens hostage between 2am and 5am before the order was given for a heavily armed SWAT to carry out the rescue mission, police said.

Nine officers used an explosive device to distract the hostage as they brought the killing to an end.

About 30 people were 'saved during the rescue', Orlando Police Chief John Mina said.

More than 320 party-goers and staff were in the club when the hostage situation unfolded.

Earlier today, a witness described how there was blood everywhere following the mass shooting.

He told the Orlando Sentinel: “I just heard the continuous bang of the gun. It was just ‘bang,bang, bang’ and constant screaming.

""I know that the guy next to me was shot and I thought I could feel liquid but it was blood.

“I then looked around and everybody was falling and dropping and screaming.

“I crawled out and I know that when you hear the banging you are not shot.

“I just know that it was very scary and very emotional. It was not an experience I want to go through again.”

The FBI is leading the shooting investigation.

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, whose officers attended the scene, said the incident 'could definitely be classified as domestic terrorism'.

However, Florida Department of Law Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Danny Banks said authorities were also investigating whether international terror was involved.

The FBI said the suspect, who is believed to be in his 20s was not a local man, may have leanings toward extreme Islamic ideologies and acted as lone wolf.

At the time of the attack in the early hours of the morning, Pulse posted a message on its Facebook page, warning revellers to 'get out of pulse and keep running'.

Ricardo Negron Almodovar was in the club.

He wrote on Facebook: ""I was there.

""People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran.

""I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well :( .""

Eyewitness Rosie Feba was in the club with her girlfriend.

She described the moment the shooting happened and said as she ran out of the club she saw a man who had been shot.

Speaking to the Orlando Sentinal, she said: ""Everyone was getting on the floor.

I told her [girlfriend] I didn't think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.""

Erickson Robledo said on Facebook: ""My friend is there. He almost got shot.

""He is ok. But he just told me that there could be over 20 dead people. He even help people to get out while they were bleeding.""","Omar Mateen, 29, is believed to have specifically targeted the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, after seeing two men kissing in another city"

In a statement released following Obama's speech, he also said that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should 'get out of this race for Presidency'.

Trump's comments come after 50 people were killed in a shooting at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning, marking the most deadly mass shooting in US history.

He said in his statement: 'Last night, our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist. It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in six months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded, and their families.

'In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words ""Radical Islam"". For that reason alone, he should step down.

'If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency.

'If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen – and it is only going to get worse.

'I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.'

Omar Mateen, 29, of Port St. Lucie in Florida, pledged allegiance to ISIS before opening fire at the Pulse gay club early on Sunday. He was eventually killed when police shot him dead inside the club three hours later.

Mateen was born in New York from parents who were from Afghanistan, though Trump still touted his controversial plans for a ban of all non-American Muslims coming into the United States.

He added: 'We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society.

'Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans. We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.'

Trump said that he will deliver a speech on Monday to further address the attack, immigration and national security.

Following the attack, Trump and Clinton initially took to Twitter to express their reactions to the mass shooting.

'Woke up to hear the devastating news from FL. As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act,' Clinton wrote on Twitter, signing it with her trademark 'H' to show that the message was actually penned by the Democratic candidate.

In a statement made by her campaign later, Clinton also called for gun control.

'This is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets,' Clinton said.

Trump made Twitter followers aware of the shooting, then went back to attacking Clinton - this time for a new general election ad - before penning more tweets about the tragedy in Orlando, in which a gunman entered a gay nightclub and mowed down 50 people, with another 53 left injured.

'Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!' Trump wrote.

He later released the statement that called for Clinton and Obama to step down from their respective roles.

Trump's initial reaction was to tweet that there was a 'really bad shooting in Orlando.'

'Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.'

He then turned his attention to Clinton's new ad, which shows Trump saying he'd like to 'knock the crap out' of a protester.

It also shows The Donald mocking a disabled New York Times Reporter. Trump countered that that's not what was really happening.

'Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!' he wrote, initially misspelling the word 'mock.'

Trump then addressed the shooting again.

'Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?' Trump wrote.

The Republican has often talked about taking on 'radical Islamic terrorism,' and early reporting points to the gunman, 29-year-old Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida, having 'leanings to radical Islamic terrorism,' according to the FBI.

In his third tweet, Trump noted that he was being heralded by supporters for being 'right' on radical Islamic terrorism, but said he would prefer 'toughness' over compliments.

In a fourth tweet, Trump challenged President Barack Obama to call the attack 'radical Islamic terrorism.'

'Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!' Trump tweeted.

When President Obama appeared in the briefing room and spoke, he labeled the massacre both an 'act of terror' and an 'act of hate.'

The president did not bring Islam into it, though made a veiled call for gun control, saying, 'to actively do nothing is a decision as well,' the president added.

After Obama's address, Trump resumed his Twitter presence, passing along reports he had seen in the media.

'Reporting that Orlando killer shouted 'Allah hu Akbar!' as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade,' Trump wrote.

He also retweeted a comment from a supporter who said, 'please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.'

Trump didn't mention the gay community in any of his responses, except to note that there was a second incident in Los Angeles, in which a man was discovered with explosives and guns wanting to target the city's Pride parade.

Sen Bernie Sanders, who will compete in one final Democratic primary this Tuesday in Washington, DC, was the first of the presidential candidates to bring up gun control, with Clinton not making her full statement until mid-afternoon.

'It's horrific, it's unthinkable,' Sanders said this morning, as he appeared on several of the Sunday shows. 'And just hopes go out to all those who were shot that they can recover.'

'We should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people,' Sanders continued.

'We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them, criminals, people who are mentally ill,' the Vermont senator added.

Later, in a statement from his campaign, he expanded his comments, making sure to mention the LGBT community, which was specifically targeted in this attack.

'All Americans are horrified, disgusted and saddened by the horrific atrocity in Orlando,' Sanders said.

'At this point we do not know whether this was an act of terrorism, a terrible hate crime against gay people or the act of a very sick person, but we extend our heartfelt condolences to the victims' families and loved ones and our thoughts are with the injured and the entire Orlando LGBTQ community,' Sanders said.

Marco Rubio, a presidential contender until mid-March who remains a Florida senator, talked at length about radical Islam when speaking to reporters live from Orlando.

'We know that some of it is inspired by a warped ideology,' Rubio said. 'We know that we've been in conflict with it for a very long time.'

'We know that they seek to intimidate us, they seek to terrorize us, and I hope they see today that they won't terrorize Americans, they won't terrorize Floridians,' Rubio continued.

'That we stand for and with all Americans, irrespective of their sexual orientation, irrespective of their party ideology, irrespective of where they live,' the Florida senator noted.

Clinton, several hours after the attack, tweeted more support for the LGBT community.

'Please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them,' Clinton tweeted.

She and President Obama also called off their first appearance together on the campaign trail this week.

Clinton and Obama were going to officially join forces on Wednesday at an event in Wisconsin.

It has now been indefinitely postponed.

Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder - a horrific massacre - of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city. Although it's still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people. I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisers. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I've directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation. We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We've reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I've directed that we must spare no effort to determine what - if any - inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we'll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us. This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need - they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come. We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm's way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It's the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough. This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends - our fellow Americans - who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub - it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights. So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American - regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation - is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans. Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well. In the coming hours and days, we'll learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families - that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more - as a country - by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us. As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts - friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us. May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love. Thank you.","In a statement released following Barack Obama's speech, he said the president should step down and Hillary Clinton should 'get out of this race' following comments about the shooting in Orlando."

ORLANDO, Fla. -- Omar Mateen called 911 to pledge his allegiance to ISIS after the shooting at an Orlando nightclub began, two separate law enforcement officials confirm to ABC News.

Some law enforcement sources had previously characterized Mateen as having sympathy for, or ties to Islamic terrorism.

Multiple law enforcement sources tell ABC News, Mateen was a U.S. born citizen who lived in St Lucie County, Florida. Mateen's parents were born in Afghanistan, officials said. He was born in New York City, but officials said there is no evidence he has been here recently.

He was believed to be living with his sister and her husband in Florida.

Mateen had two firearms licenses, a security officer license and a statewide firearms license, all expiring in September 2017.

Mateen's ex-wife, originally from New Jersey, who now lives in Colorado. Sources said they met online eight years ago, got married in Florida, lived briefly in Fort Pierce, Florida and divorced in 2011. The marriage lasted only a few months before she left, sources said. She is now engaged to someone else in Colorado

His father said he is ""in shock like the whole country."" He says he wasn't aware of anything his son might have been planning. Mir Seddique told NBC News that his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thinks that may be related to the shooting. He says it has nothing to do with religion.

Mateen took hostages and opened fire inside a crowded gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, early Sunday morning, killing 50 people and wounding 53 others before SWAT officers killed him, authorities said.

Police Chief John Mina said Mateenhad an assault-style rifle, a handgun and a ""suspicious device"" with him during the attack.

Earlier, FBI assistant agent in charge of the agency's Tampa division, Ron Hopper, said investigators are ""looking at all angles right now"" to find a motive.

""We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings towards that, that particular ideology (Islamic extremism). But right now we can't say definitively, so we're still running everything around,"" he said.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio tweeted within early Sunday morning, deeming the attack a ""horrifying act of terror.""

""Our prayers are with those injured and killed early this morning,"" Rubio wrote.

Rubio also encouraged those that live in central Florida to donate blood. Photos posted online showed that many Florida residents had lined up to do so.

Congressman Alan Grayson (D-Florida) addressed reporters in Orlando, telling them that the club may have been targeted specifically.



""It might be that we've seen a commission of an awful hate crime last night,"" Grayson said.

""Words cannot express the horror, pain, and sadness that we feel about this terrible loss,"" Grayson wrote on twitter.

The Vice President and President have both been briefed on the situation, according to The White House.

Presumed GOP nominee Donald Trump described the shooting as a ""horrific incident,"" writing on Twitter that he is praying ""for all the victims and their families.""

""When will this stop?"" Trump asked.

""When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?""

Trump later wrote that he was appreciative of the congratulations he'd received ""for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.""

Not Exactly.,"According to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, an AR-15 rifle was believed to be used in a school shooting Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which at least 17 people were killed. The AR-15 is the same weapon used by Adam Lanza, who killed 26 people, 20 of them children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. After the Sandy Hook shooting, Justin Peters wrote that “the AR-15 is very good at one thing: engaging the enemy at a rapid rate of fire.” The original piece is reprinted below.

On Dec. 24, in Webster, New York, an ex-con named William Spengler set fire to his house and then shot and killed two responding firefighters before taking his own life. He shot them with a Bushmaster AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle—the same weapon that Adam Lanza used 10 days earlier when he shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary. James Holmes used an AR-15-style rifle with a detachable 100-round magazine this past summer when he shot up a movie theater in Colorado. (Though the AR-15 is a specific model of rifle made by Colt, the term has come to generically refer to the many other rifles built to similar specifications.)

Three makes a trend, as we all know, and many people have reacted by suggesting that the federal government should ban the AR-15 and other so-called assault weapons. Gun advocates have responded with exasperation, saying that, despite appearances, AR-15-style rifles are no more dangerous than any other gun. In a piece today on humanevents.com titled “The AR-15: The Gun Liberals Love to Hate,” NRA president David Keene blasted those critics who “neither understand the nature of the firearms they would ban, their popularity or legitimate uses.” Keene noted there are several valid, non-murderous uses for rifles like the AR-15—among them recreational target shooting, hunting, and home defense—and argued that law-abiding firearms owners shouldn’t be penalized because of homicidal loners who use semi-automatics like the AR-15 for criminal purposes.

I generally consider myself a Second Amendment supporter, and I haven’t yet decided where I stand on post-Newtown gun control. I would own a gun if New York City laws didn’t make it extremely difficult to do so. But I nevertheless find Keene’s arguments disingenuous. It’s odd to cite hunting and home defense as reasons to keep selling a rifle that’s not particularly well suited, and definitely not necessary, for either. Bolt-action rifles and shotguns can also be used for hunting and home defense. Unfortunately, those guns aren’t particularly lucrative for gunmakers. The lobby’s fervent defense of military-style semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 seems motivated primarily by a desire to protect the profits in the rapidly growing “modern sporting rifle” segment of the industry.

The AR-15 was designed in 1957 at the behest of the U.S. Army, which asked Armalite to come up with a “high-velocity, full and semi auto fire, 20 shot magazine, 6lbs loaded, able to penetrate both sides of a standard Army helmet at 500 meters rifle,” according to ar15.com. When it entered Army service in the 1960s, it was renamed the M16, in accordance with the Army Nomenclature System. “AR-15” came to refer to the rifle’s semi-automatic civilian equivalent. From 1994 to 2004, AR-15-style rifles were subject to the now-expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Since then, the rifle and others like it have become tremendously popular. Last month, I estimated that upward of 3.5 million AR-15-style rifles currently exist in the United States. People like the rifle because it is modular and thus customizable (one article calls the AR-15 “perhaps the most flexible firearm ever developed; in seconds, a carbine can be switched over to a long-range rifle by swapping upper receivers”), because it is easy to shoot, and because carrying it around makes you look like a badass.

But the AR-15 is not ideal for the hunting and home-defense uses that the NRA’s Keene cited today. Though it can be used for hunting, the AR-15 isn’t really a hunting rifle. Its standard .223 caliber ammunition doesn’t offer much stopping power for anything other than small game. Hunters themselves find the rifle controversial, with some arguing AR-15-style rifles empower sloppy, “spray and pray” hunters to waste ammunition. (The official Bushmaster XM15 manual lists the maximum effective rate of fire at 45 rounds per minute.) As one hunter put it in the comments section of an article on americanhunter.org, “I served in the military and the M16A2/M4 was the weapon I used for 20 years. It is first and foremost designed as an assault weapon platform, no matter what the spin. A hunter does not need a semi-automatic rifle to hunt, if he does he sucks, and should go play video games. I see more men running around the bush all cammo’d up with assault vests and face paint with tricked out AR’s. These are not hunters but wannabe weekend warriors.”

In terms of repelling a home invasion—which is what most people mean when they talk about home defense—an AR-15-style rifle is probably less useful than a handgun. The AR-15 is a long gun, and can be tough to maneuver in tight quarters. When you shoot it, it’ll overpenetrate—sending bullets through the walls of your house and possibly into the walls of your neighbor’s house—unless you purchase the sort of ammunition that fragments on impact. (This is true for other guns, as well, but, again, the thing with the AR-15 is that it lets you fire more rounds faster.)

AR-15–style rifles are very useful, however, if what you’re trying to do is sell guns. In a recent Forbes article, Abram Brown reported that “gun ownership is at a near 20-year high, generating $4 billion in commercial gun and ammunition sales.” But that money’s not coming from selling shotguns and bolt-action rifles to pheasant hunters. In its 2011 annual report, Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation announced that bolt-action hunting rifles accounted for 6.6 percent of its net sales in 2011 (down from 2010 and 2009), while modern sporting rifles (like AR-15-style weapons) accounted for 18.2 percent of its net sales. The Freedom Group’s 2011 annual report noted that the commercial modern sporting rifle market grew at a 27 percent compound annual rate from 2007 to 2011, whereas the entire domestic long gun market only grew at a 3 percent rate.

As the NRA’s David Keene notes, a lot of people do use modern sporting rifles for target shooting and in marksmanship competitions. But the guns also appeal to another demographic that doesn’t get nearly as much press—paranoid survivalists who worry about having to fend off thieves and trespassers in the event of disaster. Online shooting message boards are rife with references to potential “SHTF scenarios,” where SHTF stands for “shit hits the fan”—governmental collapse, societal breakdown. (Adam Lanza’s mother, Nancy Lanza, has been described as “a gun-hoarding survivalist who was stockpiling weapons in preparation for an economic collapse.”) An article on ar15.com titled “The Ideal Rifle” notes that “the threats from crime, terrorism, natural disaster, and weapons of mass destruction are real. If something were to happen today, you would need to have made a decision about the rifle you would select and be prepared for such an event. So the need to select a ‘survival’ rifle is real. Selecting a single ‘ideal rifle’ is not easy. The AR-15 series of rifles comes out ahead when compared to everything else.” Depending on where you live, it’s perfectly legal to stockpile weapons to use in the event of Armageddon. But that’s a far different argument than the ones firearms advocates have been using since the Newtown shootings.

As I said, I generally think of myself as a Second Amendment supporter, and a month ago, I would’ve probably agreed with the NRA’s position. But the Newtown shooting caused me to re-examine my stance—as is, I think, fitting—and to question some of the rhetoric advocates use to defend weapons like this. In his piece at Human Events, Keene ridiculed the notion that AR-15-style rifles ought to be banned just because “a half dozen [AR-15s] out of more than three million have been misused after illegally falling into the hands of crazed killers.” But the AR-15 is very good at one thing: engaging the enemy at a rapid rate of fire. When someone like Adam Lanza uses it to take out 26 people in a matter of minutes, he’s committing a crime, but he isn’t misusing the rifle. That’s exactly what it was engineered to do.

Mateen's connection to ISIS does not necessarily mean he was in direct contact with the radical jihadists or that the group directed him to carry out the attack. Nelson, the Florida senator, noted that the apparent connection to ISIS was not ""official,"" and US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters they had yet to uncover direct contacts between the gunman and any extremist group.

Mateen legally purchased the two firearms used in the attack on the nightclub — a handgun and a long gun — in the past few days, a police spokesman said in a news conference on Sunday.

""In 2014, Mateen again came to the attention to the FBI because of possible ties to an American suicide bomber, Moner Abusalha. The FBI interviewed Mateen and determined that contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive threat at the time.""

""The FBI first became aware of Mateen in 2013, when he made threats to coworkers, including possible ties to terrorist activities,"" an FBI spokesman said Sunday in a news conference.

Mateen was on an FBI list of suspected ISIS sympathizers and was looked into by federal authorities once in 2013 and again in 2014. He was the subject of a brief FBI investigation in 2014 before the case was closed.

Law enforcement confirmed that the incident was being treated as an act of terrorism.

""This is clearly an act of terror,"" Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said in a news conference on Sunday. President Barack Obama called the shooting an ""act of terror"" and ""an act of hate.""

Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Sunday in a news conference that Mateen, who was from Fort Pierce, Florida, had ""some connection to ISIS,"" and Rep. Adam Schiff — the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee — said Mateen had pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to information he had received from the Department of Homeland Security.

The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, called 911 sometime Saturday night and pledged allegiance to ISIS, mentioning the Boston marathon bombers during the call.

The agency said the shooting was the work of an ""ISIS fighter,"" multiple media outlets have reported.

The ISIS-affiliated news agency Amaq News broadcast a claim of responsibility from ISIS for a shooting rampage at a gay nightclub in Orlando that left 50 people dead over the weekend.

The Islamic State said in a recent message to followers that they should mount attacks during this month, which is the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.

Mir Seddique Mateen, Omar Mateen's father, told NBC News that his son's actions had ""nothing to do with religion."" He said his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago, and he thought homophobia may have inspired his son to attack the nightclub.

""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident,"" Seddique said. ""We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.""

Seddique, an Afghan immigrant to the US, has his own YouTube channel where he has expressed his support for the Afghan Taliban, and he recently declared his candidacy for the Afghan presidency.

The YouTube videos come from a television show Seddique hosted called ""Durand Jirga"" on a channel called Payam-e-Afghan, which broadcasts from California, The Washington Post reported.

Chris Harmer, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told Business Insider on Sunday that ""at this point, it's anyone's guess as to how involved Omar Mateen was with either Al Qaeda or ISIS.""

""The 911 call pledging allegiance to ISIS shows he was emotionally or intellectually sympathetic to ISIS, but does not show that he had any contact with ISIS,"" he said. ""Bottom line, it is clear that Mateen was, at a minimum, influenced by ISIS, expressed some loyalty to ISIS, but it is not clear that he had any communication or connection with ISIS beyond that.""

JM Berger, an expert on the Islamic State and coauthor of ""ISIS: State of Terror,"" largely agreed.

""His pledge of allegiance to ISIS does not necessarily mean he was affiliated, although that may turn out to be the case. We're still very early in the investigation,"" Berger told Business Insider.

""Calling 911 minutes before to pledge allegiance is like what happened in San Bernardino,"" Mia Bloom, an ISIS expert and former fellow at the International Center for the Study of Terrorism at Penn State, told Business Insider.

Tashfeen Malik, the female shooter in the San Bernardino attack that left 14 people dead, pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook during the rampage.

""This was an act of terror and an act of hate of the LGBT community,"" Bloom added. ""ISIS is well known for despising and hunting down gay people, throwing them off the tallest buildings in Raqqa, etc. But we need more information to know whether there was anything more than a superficial (and last-minute) connection to ISIS.""

He 'was not a stable person'

The overnight shooting at Pulse nightclub — a gay club in central Orlando — is the deadliest shooting in US history, with more fatalities than the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007 (32 dead) and the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 (27 dead).

Mateen, a US citizen, was born in New York in 1986. An FBI representative said he ""was organized and well-prepared"" to carry out the attack.

Mateen's ex-wife told The Washington Post that he beat her and ""was not a stable person.""

""He beat me,"" she said. ""He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn't finished or something like that.""

One of Mateen's former coworkers described him as ""unhinged and unstable"" and said he spoke of killing people often.

But the imam at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, where Mateen went often to pray, told reporters in Fort Pierce that Mateen ""was the most quiet guy — he never talked to anyone.""

""He would come and pray and leave,"" Imam Shafiq Rahman said. ""There was no indication at all he would do something violent.”

Rahman's son, on the other hand, said Mateen ""seemed like an aggressive person.""

""It was just his demeanor,"" he said. ""He used to work out a lot.”

Mateen reportedly had a 3-year-old son whom he would take with him to the mosque.

Mateen worked as a security guard in Fort Pierce and rented a car to drive to Orlando and carry out the attack, CNN's Evan Perez reported.

The leader of Orlando's Islamic faith community, Muhammad Musri, urged people not to rush to judgment or ""sensationalize"" the shooting.

""I call on my fellow faith leaders ... please pray for the victims and their families at this hour,"" he said during a press conference. ""I want to caution anyone from rushing to judgment or sensationalizing the story, because we do not want the focus of the story to shift from what it is: a horrible tragedy. We are mourning, we are heartbroken.""

Mateen entered Pulse shortly before 2 a.m. after exchanging fire with an off-duty police officer working security at the club, the police said in a news conference. He was armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun, according to law-enforcement officials' description of the incident. TMZ has reported that Mateen had a state firearms license.

Mateen barricaded himself inside the nightclub and took hostages just after 2 a.m. and was negotiating with the police when he gave them his name, according to CNN. A SWAT team stormed the club about three hours later and shot him dead.

At least 53 people were wounded and transported to local hospitals. About 320 people were inside the nightclub at the time of the shooting, according to the Orlando police. A state of emergency has been declared.

""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running,"" the nightclub said on its Facebook page at 2:09 a.m.

Pulse markets itself as ""Orlando's premier gay nightclub."" It was Latin night at the club, according to its Facebook page.

Overnight, officials released additional names. However, the identities of more than half of the victims have yet to be made public.

Obama described the attack as ""an act of terror and hate."" The suspect, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, reportedly swore allegiance to the head of the Islamic State in a call to authorities just prior to the attack. The shooting took place at Pulse Orlando Night Club & Ultra Lounge, a popular gay bar, where about 350 people were dancing and drinking. A state of emergency for Orange County was declared by the City of Orlando and Scott.



Mateen was killed by law enforcement in an exchange of gunfire, according to Orlando Police Chief John Mina. Eleven city officers and three deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on leave. An Orlando police officer was shot during the exchange of bullets, but police say his Kevlar helmet saved him. Guns traced in #Orlando shooting: .223 caliber AR type rifle and 9mm semiautomatic pistol. Similar to those pictured pic.twitter.com/Ao5pcLtwBg

— ATF HQ (@ATFHQ) June 12, 2016 Seddique Mir Mateen, the father of the shooter, posted a video on his Facebook page early Monday lamenting the loss of his son and his actions.

“My son, Omar Mateen, was a very good boy, an educated boy, who had a child and a wife, very respectful of his parents,” he said in Dari, a language spoken in Afghanistan, according to a translation from The New York Times. 

 “I don’t know what caused this,” he said. “I did not know and did not understand that he has anger in his heart. Only God can punish homosexuality. This is not an issue for humans to punish.” The father told NBC News on Sunday that the shooting “has nothing to do with religion.” In an interview, he suggested his son had become enraged at seeing a gay couple kissing during a recent trip to Miami.

 More than five hours after the shooter was killed, bodies were still inside the club. According to authorities, work at the scene had been complicated by the potential of an explosive device. As night fell, many families of people who were at the club did not know whether their loved ones were killed or hospitalized. Orlando Police began releasing the names of those killed about 14 hours after the shooting. Edward Sotomayor Jr., Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Oscasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero were the first victims identified. All four were killed, police said. Orlando has established a webpage where officials intend to list victims' names once notifications of next of kin have been made. The address is www.cityoforlando.net/victims.

The shooting reportedly began around 2 a.m. An officer responded to a call of shots fired at the club. He first engaged the shooter outside of the club, with gunfire exchanged. The man ran back inside Pulse, shot many of those in the bar, and a hostage situation began. Some who were inside the club thought the gunshots were part of a music set.

 A message on the Pulse Orlando Facebook page at 2:09 a.m. read, ""Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running."" Law enforcement raided the club at 5 a.m., rescuing approximately 30 hostages. The gunman was reportedly carrying an assault rifle, a handgun and a ""device,"" according to Mina. “We were dancing by the hip-hop area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam, and the only thing I could think of was to duck, but I ran out instead,” Joel Figueroa, 19, of Orlando, told The New York Times. “Everybody was screaming and running toward the front door. I didn’t get to see the shooter.”

A friend of his had been shot three times and taken to a hospital, he said. Christopher Hansen dropped to the floor when he heard gunshots. ""I just fell down and crawled out,"" Hansen told the Orlando Sentinel. ""I helped someone who was on the ground. I wasn't sure if he was dead or alive."" Mina Justice told the AP her son Eddie texted her from inside the club. In a video posted to YouTube, Justice said Eddie texted her: ""He's coming. I'm gonna die."" Justice had yet to hear from her son Sunday evening.

Sunday's death toll far surpassed an attack at Virginia Tech in 2007, where 33 were killed, as well as high-profile attacks at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2013, where 28 died, and a mass shooting that killed 14 in San Bernardino, Calif., last December.

 President Obama alluded to these tragedies and others in a fresh call for action on new gun control measures. ""This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, in a house of worship, or in a movie theater or in a nightclub,"" Obama said. ""And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well."" Mateen, 29, was from Port St. Lucie. He was a U.S. citizen, but some of his family members are not. Grayson would not say where the family is from, but several media outlets have reported they are from Afghanistan.

ATF confirmed to the press Sunday afternoon that Mateen purchased a handgun and long gun within the last few days. FBI agent Ron Hopper told the media Sunday morning that the suspect ""may have leanings toward extreme Islamic ideologies."" NBC News reported Mateen called 911 just before the shooting and swore allegiance to the head of the Islamic State. 

 ""The Islamic State news agency has just issued a statement that says they are responsible,"" U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said Sunday afternoon. ""That has not been confirmed."" Security firm G4S confirmed Mateen has been employed with the company for more than eight years. ""We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation,"" G4S said in a statement.
• Orlando Shooter and Timeline: What We Know So Far
• ‘This Has Nothing To Do With Religion,’ Orlando Shooter’s Dad Says The attack was well-organized, and the shooter was well-prepared, officials said. “This is clearly an act of terrorism,” Scott said at a Sunday afternoon press conference. “It’s sickening, (and) it should make every American angry.” Blood donation centers in the Orlando area were full of people ready to donate for the dozens in need, with officials encouraging folks to come back over the next few days. LGBT organization Equality Florida has established a fundraiser to support victims of the shooting. The shooting at the gay bar took place during LGBT pride month, celebrated each year in June. There was a reportedly unrelated arrest in Santa Monica, Calif., where a man was found with assault weapons and explosive materials, possibly meant for the Los Angeles Pride Festival on Sunday, authorities said.

The mass shooting in Orlando has led to an increased police presence for Pride events in Boston, Detroit and Washington, D.C., on Sunday. ""We will not be deterred by hate as we gather to celebrate love,"" said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Gay bars have been targets for attacks in the past, most notably a bomb attack at an Atlanta club in 1997. Marco Guinette, of Massachusetts, owns the MB Lounge in Worcester.

 ""I’m appalled, and they are saying it’s a terrorist attack, which is unfortunately a sad thing this country is dealing with all over the place,"" Guinette told Patch. ""Now, being the owner of the MB, it frightens me to know that now I really have to watch closely. You just don’t know what will come up. It’s just horrific these people died.""

""This could have been any one of our communities,"" he said. ""As Americans, we are united in grief, outrage and resolve to defend our people."" U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a press conference that, “Islamic terrorists need to know they will not win.” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, referenced attacks in Paris in November. Coordinated terrorist attacks there left 130 dead, with the majority of those killed at a concert hall. ""This attack is so painfully reminiscent of the terrible attack at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris and other ISIS-inspired attacks in recent years,"" Schiff noted. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said his community needs to stand strong and support the victims and their families.

People who believe they have an immediate family member who may be in the hospital following the shooting are asked to report to the main entrance of Orlando Regional Medical Center's north tower, 52 W. Underwood St. Identification cards are required. Pulse owner Barbara Poma released a statement noted she was grieving with those who lost loved ones. ""From the beginning, Pulse has served as a place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community,"" Poma wrote. Pulse's cofounder, Ron Legler, who now lives in Baltimore, was ""devastated and heartbroken"" by the news, he wrote on Facebook Sunday. Pulse was founded in 2004 by Poma and Legler. Poma opened the club in honor of her brother John, who died in 1991 after battling HIV for several years, according to the club website. Pulse works with a wide variety of organizations to raise awareness for HIV.",Suspect's father releases video overnight; Vigils and tributes held to honor the dead and 53 others injured.

The FBI said the 29-year-old killer born in New York was an American citizen who legally purchased two firearms within the last week.

Despite being aware of Mateen since 2013, following inflammatory comments made to co-workers and over ties to an American suicide bomber in 2014, he was not under surveillance.

Authorities deemed his link to the bomber to be minimal so did not constitute a threat, and after interviews and an investigation dropped the probe into his comments.

It has been revealed that 911 calls involving the shooter from Port St Lucie, Florida and featuring conversations about the Islamic State before the massacre, have now become federal evidence.

US president Barack Obama called the killings at the gay-friendly establishment an ""act of terror"" and an ""act of hate"" and said they are being investigated as terrorism.

More than 300 people were inside the building at the time of the attack, which has now become the worst mass shooting in American history - 53 people have also been taken to hospital.

President Obama praised the emergency service response and described the gunman as a person ""filled with hatred"".

He said the massacre is a reminder of how easy it is for someone to access a weapon like a gun, allowing them to go on and shoot other people.

""We have to decide if that is the type of country we want to be. To actively to do nothing is a decision as well,"" Mr Obama added.

The first names of the victims have now been released by the police - Edward Sotomayor Jr, Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero are among the dead.

Mir Seddique, the father of the shooter, told NBC News that he thinks a recent experience in which his son saw two men kissing might be related to the shooting.

He apologised for the whole incident, said he was not aware of the actions of his security guard son and claimed ""this had nothing to do with religion"".

The killer, who also held hostages in a three-hour stand-off, later died in a gunfight with Swat officers in the Florida city. He exchanged gunfire with 14 officers at the club.

Mr Obama has also ordered flags at the White House and federal buildings to be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect for the victims.

And in the aftermath of the massacre, police departments across the US increased patrols around popular gay-friendly locations and venues.

Orlando mayor, Buddy Dyer, described the scene saying there was ""blood everywhere"".

Political leaders from around the world have since condemned the attack and offered their condolences to the victims.

Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani said ""targeting civilians is not justifiable under any circumstances whatsoever"", while Prime Minister David Cameron said he was ""horrified"" by the shooting.

French president Francois Hollande said he ""expresses the full support of France and the French with America's authorities and its people in this difficult time"".

And Buckingham Palace said the Queen had sent a personal message to Mr Obama on Sunday night, saying: ""Prince Philip and I have been shocked by the events in Orlando.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been affected.""","A gunman who massacred 50 people in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub was known to US authorities, it has been revealed."

The shooter is reportedly Omar Mateen, a U.S. citizen from Port Saint Lucie, Fla., according to CBS News.

Hopper said, The history that we know of this individual so far is that he may have made threats that he was tied to islamic terror.

In an interview on Fox Newss Fox & Friends Sunday, Hopper said, Theres allegations that the individual has made threats in the past to having ties to terrorist organizations. However, those have not been confirmed or vetted so far. Obviously, we are in the initial stages of this investigation at this time.

When asked where he got that information, Hopper said, Unfortunately, I cant divulge that information at this time because all these things are tied to the actual active investigation so were trying to be as clear and transparent as we can because we want the general public to feel as safe and secure as possible and thats not something that I can share.

During a press conference later in the day, Hopper said, We do have suggestions that that individual may have leanings towards that, that particular ideology [Islamic extremism]. But right now we cant say definitively, so were still running everything around.



Theres allegations that the individual has made threats in the past to having ties to terrorist organizations. However, those have not been confirmed or vetted so far. The question I would have, is why wasn’t it confirmed or

 vetted AT THE TIME ?? 



WAG on my part, soon the mooslims won’t even try and apologize, they smell blood in the water and they are like sharks, to them it is perfectly logical to smite the unbelievers and dominate them. And the left all but telegraphs willingness to submit to any people with a grievance. Muslim mass killings will be a monthly occurrence and your average every day “peaceful” muslim in the space of a year will blame the victims.

Pulse was founded in 2004 to promote awareness of LGBT rights in Orlando, Florida.

But on Sunday, the safe space became a scene of horror as Islamic extremist Omar Mateen took party-goers hostage and gunned them down one-by-one, killing 50.

LGBTQ support groups have come out in force to show solidarity with the club and the community after the shooter's father revealed it was an attack motivated by homophobia.

The Harvey Milk Foundation, headed by Milk's nephew Stuart, paid tribute to 'young men and women who were simply out for a night of dancing and enjoyment of our community during LGBT Pride month'.

'These victims of a hate crime targeting an LGBT club had their futures stolen, had their dreams stolen, their potential contributions stolen from us all,' he said in a lengthy statement.

He added: 'We send a world of love and prayers to all who are grieving today and to all who will begin the hard journey to recover from untold wounds, both physical and emotional.'

Equality Florida said in a statement on Sunday that their support network has been flooded with distressed messages.

'We have received a steady stream of emails and messages from those seeking to help or to make sense of the senseless,' the statement read.

'We make no assumptions on motive. We will await the details in tears of sadness and anger.

'We stand in solidarity and keep our thoughts on all whose lives have been lost or altered forever in this tragedy.'

The group has also set up a GoFundMe page for victims, raising more than $77,000 in just two hours, and more than $400,000 by Sunday afternoon.

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) tweeted: 'Our hearts break for the victims and families of this horrific act of violence. We stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ community in #Orlando.'

Rob Domenico, a board member of LGBTQ advocacy group The Center Orlando told NBC: 'This is a time, more than ever, that we need to put the unity back in community and to stand up to show love and compassion to those going through this horrible travesty.'

Speaking to the network's audience, he said: 'Step out of your comfort zone. If you've never volunteered, now is the time you're needed.'

Pulse, the brainchild of Barbara Poma and Ron Legler, was created in 2004 in tribute to Poma's brother John, a gay man who died of HIV in 1991.

Alongside club nights and drag shows, the Orlando dance spot also hosted educational events about AIDS, safe sex, gay rights and transgender causes.

It was in this unique haven that 29-year-old gunman Mateen shot 103 people.

According to the club's website, Poma and Legler wanted to create a space for gay people in a community where many felt disenfranchised.

Poma's brother, they explain, was raised in a strict Italian family.

'Being gay was frowned upon,' the website reads.

'However, when John came out to his family and friends, the family dynamic transitioned from a culture of strict tradition to one of acceptance and love.'

After John died, Poma and Legler vowed to create space for people like him.

'It was important to create an atmosphere that embraced the gay lifestyle with décor that would make John proud.

'Most importantly, (we) coined the name Pulse for John's heartbeat — as a club that is John's inspiration, where he is kept alive in the eyes of his friends and family.'

It was a haven for the gay community, and a popular social spot for gay and straight party-goers.

'Even though this place is gay bar, all people come out and dance on Latin night,' reads on Yelp review.

Before Mateen occupied the club at 2am, party-goers had enjoyed hours of the club's popular Latin night.

But as the horror unfolded, a message was posted on Pulse's official Twitter account.

'Everyone get out of pulse and keep running,' it said.

One of the headline acts included RuPaul's Drag Race competitor Kenya Michaels.

Michaels later posted on Facebook: 'I want everyone to know I am ok please pray for my friends and family at pulse night club.'

According to the FBI, he had claimed allegiance to the Islamic State. Reportedly, he had been enraged by seeing gay men in public.

Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old man from Florida’s Treasure Coast, killed 50 people at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, starting at about 2am on Sunday, and was killed by police after a three-hour standoff. Mateen was a US citizen, born in New York to parents who had emigrated from Afghanistan.



The shooting left 53 injured, according to police.

The security firm G4S confirmed in a statement on Sunday that it had employed Mateen since September 2007.

A former colleague told the New York Times on Sunday he had complained to the company several times about Mateen, who he said “talked about killing people all the time”.

“I complained multiple times that he was dangerous, that he didn’t like blacks, women, lesbians and Jews,” Daniel Gilroy, a former Fort Pierce police officer, said.

“You meet bigots but he was above and beyond. He was always angry, sweating, just angry at the world.”

Gilroy said his relationship with Mateen had become tense, the gunman pestering him with up to 20 or 30 text message each day, and more than a dozen phone messages.

He said wished he had pushed G4S harder to take action. “If I didn’t walk away and I fought, then maybe 50 people would still be alive today,” he said.

“I wasn’t shocked,” he said of Sunday’s massacre. “I saw it coming.”

The gunman’s former wife, Sitora Yusifiy, also recalled his temper on Sunday, revealing Mateen had beaten her regularly after they were married in 2009.

“A few months after we were married I saw his instability, I saw his bipolar, and he would get mad out of nowhere, and that’s when I started worrying about my safety,” Yusifiy said.

“Then after a few months he started abusing me physically, very often, and not allowing me to speak to my family, and keeping me hostage from them.”

She said Mateen, who she divorced in 2011, had aspired to be a police officer was “mentally unstable and mentally ill [and] obviously disturbed, deeply, and traumatised”.

He “did follow religion, he did practice and he had his faith” but showed “no sign” of radicalism, she said.

The FBI agent Ron Hopper said on Sunday afternoon that Mateen had a history with the agency. Agents first became aware of Mateen in 2013, after he made inflammatory statements to co-workers about affiliations with a terror group. The FBI interviewed him twice, Hopper said, but could not substantiate any connection to terrorists.



In 2014, Hopper said, the FBI interviewed Mateen again because of a connection to a suicide bomber. But, he said, “contact was minimal” and Mateen was released.

Despite those interactions, according to state records, Mateen held licenses to work as a security guard and carry a firearm in Florida. A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said Mateen had purchased the weapons he used in the Orlando shooting within the past week.



Just before the shooting, Hopper said, Mateen declared in a 911 call his allegiance “in general to the Islamic State”.



Earlier, the Florida senator Bill Nelson said: “Obviously he knew what he was doing. I asked the FBI if there was any connection to Isis. There appears to be. But they are naturally cautious and waiting throughout to see if this [is the case] as the facts emerge. I have checked with intelligence staff, and they do believe that there is some link to Isis.

“But I might say that is not official.”

Florida governor Rick Scott said: “Clearly this is an act of terrorism.”



The full extent of Mateen’s motivations may have been complex and less clear than immediately apparent, though. A knowledgeable US official told the Guardian that while the federal investigation was in the earliest stages, an initial hypothesis regarding the shooter’s motive leaned closer to a hate crime than an act of terrorism.

“The idea of it being terrorism is not off the table, but it’s probably not the principal approach,” said the official, who would not be identified by name or agency in discussing a fast-moving investigation. “There are other reasons to believe it was motivated toward a very specific kind of community, obviously.”

That investigation was still determining if the shooting was “terrorism or a massive, massive hate crime”, the official said.

The official emphasized that all hypotheses were preliminary. Investigators were still gathering facts about the mass-casualty incident. Authorities said it was not immediately clear if the shooter was working alone, or had outside support or training. When killed, he was carrying a pistol and an assault rifle.

Mir Seddique, Mateen’s father, told NBC News: “This has nothing to do with religion.” He added that his son was infuriated when he recently saw two men kissing in Miami.

Authorities in Port St Lucie, Florida, about an hour and a half south of Orlando, descended on the home on Southwest Bayshore Boulevard where Mateen lived. His neighbors were not immediately reachable for further comment.","US citizen, 29, was born in New York and FBI had been aware of him since 2013, agent says"

The Harvey Milk Foundation, headed by Milk's nephew Stuart, paid tribute to 'young men and women who were simply out for a night of dancing and enjoyment of our community during LGBT Pride month'.

'These victims of a hate crime targeting an LGBT club had their futures stolen, had their dreams stolen, their potential contributions stolen from us all,' he said in a lengthy statement.

He added: 'We send a world of love and prayers to all who are grieving today and to all who will begin the hard journey to recover from untold wounds, both physical and emotional.'

Equality Florida said in a statement on Sunday that their support network has been flooded with distressed messages.

'We make no assumptions on motive. We will await the details in tears of sadness and anger.

The group has also set up a GoFundMe page for victims, raising more than $77,000 in just two hours, and more than $400,000 by Sunday afternoon.

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) tweeted: 'Our hearts break for the victims and families of this horrific act of violence. We stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ community in #Orlando.'

Pulse, the brainchild of Barbara Poma and Ron Legler, was created in 2004 in tribute to Poma's brother John, a gay man who died of HIV in 1991.

Alongside club nights and drag shows, the Orlando dance spot also hosted educational events about AIDS, safe sex, gay rights and transgender causes.

It was in this unique haven that 29-year-old gunman Mateen shot 103 people.

According to the club's website, Poma and Legler wanted to create a space for gay people in a community where many felt disenfranchised.

Poma's brother, they explain, was raised in a strict Italian family.

'Being gay was frowned upon,' the website reads.

'However, when John came out to his family and friends, the family dynamic transitioned from a culture of strict tradition to one of acceptance and love.'

After an hours-long standoff, police stormed the building, killed the gunman and rescued about 30 hostages.

The massacre is the worst mass shooting in American history, and like several recent mass shootings was committed by a man with an AR-15 assault rifle. The suspect also carried a handgun.

Authorities released the first names of victims, after notifying kin. The first four people named were Edward Sotomayor Jr, Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, and Juan Ramon Guerrero. Survivors and the families of victims recalled horrific stories of how the attack unfolded, and many waited in fear and anticipation to learn whether their loved ones were victims.

The gunman was identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, a US citizen from Fort Pierce, Florida. He was known to the FBI, the special agent Ron Hopper told reporters, and the subject of two investigations into terror links in 2013 and 2014. Those investigations were deemed inconclusive and closed, he said. The shooter called 911 before the attack and spoke with an emergency operator in “general to the Islamic State”, Hopper said. No terror group has claimed responsibility.

A US official told the Guardian the attack may have been a “massive hate crime”. Mateen’s father told NBC News that his son had become enraged by a gay couple kissing, and the gunman’s ex-wife told the Washington Post that he was an abusive and unstable man.

Mateen bought a long gun and a handgun in the past week, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms said: “He is not a prohibited person so he can legally walk into a gun dealership.”

Barack Obama declared the attack “an act of terror and an act of hate”, and cautioned that the investigation was still in its early stages. “No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.” Hillary Clinton also used the word “terror” and condemned the attack on the LGBT community. Donald Trump castigated the president and said he should “step down”, for “disgracefully refus[ing] to even say the words ‘Radical Islam’”.

Muslim American leaders, LGBT groups, Pope Francis and others condemned the horrific attack, and urged Americans to rally together. The FBI solicited the public for tips to aid the investigation, blood banks asked for donations around the US, and a fundraising campaign for victims’ medical bills raised $416,000. Authorities set up hotlines for information and campaigns for donations.",Authorities released the names of four victims as US official says attack may have been a ‘massive hate crime’ but it’s still too soon to confirm motivation

Rob Domenico, a board member of LGBTQ advocacy group The Center Orlando told NBC: 'This is a time, more than ever, that we need to put the unity back in community and to stand up to show love and compassion to those going through this horrible travesty.'

Speaking to the network's audience, he said: 'Step out of your comfort zone. If you've never volunteered, now is the time you're needed.'

Pulse, the brainchild of Barbara Poma and Ron Legler, was created in 2004 in tribute to Poma's brother John, a gay man who died of HIV in 1991.

Alongside club nights and drag shows, the Orlando dance spot also hosted educational events about AIDS, safe sex, gay rights and transgender causes.

It was in this unique haven that 29-year-old gunman Mateen shot 103 people.

According to the club's website, Poma and Legler wanted to create a space for gay people in a community where many felt disenfranchised.

Poma's brother, they explain, was raised in a strict Italian family.

'Being gay was frowned upon,' the website reads.

'However, when John came out to his family and friends, the family dynamic transitioned from a culture of strict tradition to one of acceptance and love.'

After John died, Poma and Legler vowed to create space for people like him.

'It was important to create an atmosphere that embraced the gay lifestyle with décor that would make John proud.

'Most importantly, (we) coined the name Pulse for John's heartbeat — as a club that is John's inspiration, where he is kept alive in the eyes of his friends and family.'

It was a haven for the gay community, and a popular social spot for gay and straight party-goers.

'Even though this place is gay bar, all people come out and dance on Latin night,' reads on Yelp review.

Before Mateen occupied the club at 2am, party-goers had enjoyed hours of the club's popular Latin night.

But as the horror unfolded, a message was posted on Pulse's official Twitter account.

'Everyone get out of pulse and keep running,' it said.

One of the headline acts included RuPaul's Drag Race competitor Kenya Michaels.

Michaels later posted on Facebook: 'I want everyone to know I am ok please pray for my friends and family at pulse night club.'

Neither Poma nor Legler were available to comment immediately on Sunday as they deal with the aftermath of the massacre, the worst mass shooting attack in American history.","Alongside club nights and drag shows, the Orlando dance spot also hosted educational events about AIDS, safe sex, gay rights and transgender causes."

LGBTQ support groups have come out in force to show solidarity with the club and the community after the shooter's father revealed it was an attack motivated by homophobia.

The Harvey Milk Foundation, headed by Milk's nephew Stuart, paid tribute to 'young men and women who were simply out for a night of dancing and enjoyment of our community during LGBT Pride month'.

'These victims of a hate crime targeting an LGBT club had their futures stolen, had their dreams stolen, their potential contributions stolen from us all,' he said in a lengthy statement.

He added: 'We send a world of love and prayers to all who are grieving today and to all who will begin the hard journey to recover from untold wounds, both physical and emotional.'

The shooting, now being called the deadliest in US history, also appeared to specifically target the LGBT+ community.

It happened at Pulse, a gay nightclub, during LGBT Pride Month, and nearly a year after the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide.

The Harvey Milk Foundation is a gay-rights-advocacy group named after Harvey Milk, a civil-rights leader and one of the first openly gay elected officials in the US. He was assassinated in San Francisco in 1978.

In its statement, the group said, ""These victims had their futures stolen ... their dreams stolen ... their potential contributions stolen from us all.""

The statement continued, ""Hate and separation continue to bring forth too much grief, too many stolen lives across the world. May we also have the strength to address and deal with the roots of hatred that target any minority community with violence anywhere in the world.""

Though the 29-year-old gunman, Omar Saddiqui Mateen, was on an FBI list of suspected ISIS sympathizers, Mateen's father told NBC News that his son's actions had ""nothing to do with religion."" He noted that his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thinks that may be related to the shooting.

In the wake of the shooting, long lines formed at the local blood bank, OneBlood, forcing the location to begin turning people away.

Earlier reports incorrectly suggested that existing FDA guidelines regulating blood donation by some LGBT donors had been lifted. It has been particularly difficult for gay men to give blood due to those FDA recommendations designed to prevent the transmission of HIV. Those rules were relaxed late last year.

The most recent numbers have 50 dead, but as is typical, it will be some time before we know the reality of what happened, why, and how.

Here's the latest from The Daily Beast:

Some 50 people are dead and 53 are injured after a gunman attacked a gay club in Orlando, Florida early Sunday morning in the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since Sandy Hook. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the gunman was carrying an assault rifle, handgun, and what police called a ""device."" The gunman was killed by SWAT around 6 a.m. (one officer sustained an injury that is not life threatening). The gunman has not been publicaly identified, but two officials told CBS News he is Omar Mateen of Port Saint Lucie, Florida. An FBI agent told the press the mass murder is being investigated as an act of terrorism. ""This is an incident, as I see it, that we certainly classify as domestic terror incident,"" said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings in an earlier press conference.

UPDATE: The father of the shooter has apologized for what has happened and said he witnessed his son previously get angry when he saw two men kissing in a restaurant in Miami.

UDPATE: FBI sources say that Mateen had been investigated before, and CNN is reporting that he may have ""pledged allegiance"" to the Islamic State.

UPDATE: Mateen's ex-wife spoke to the Washington Post and said he used to beat her. They were married in 2009 and divorced in 2011. She says he didn't seem to have fallen under the sway of radical Islam at the time.

UPDATE: June is gay pride month and gay pride events are happening this weekend in West Hollywood. Police there this morning arrested a man with weapons and ammunition in his car, as well as an ingredient used to make pipe bombs. Read more here.

UDPATE: Sources are telling the media that Mateen called 911 right before the attack to declare allegiance to ISIS.

UPDATE: The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, though that doesn't mean the terrorist group actually coordinated it.

UPDATE: The City of Orlando has started identifying victims.",Latest numbers have 50 dead.

Nelson: Pulse Nightclub gunman may have ties to ISIS,"ORLANDO, Fla. (WPEC) - U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, D-Fla., says the man suspected in the deadly shooting attack at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando may have had ties to ISIS.

Nelson made those comments in a news conference Sunday, hours after the shooting that left 50 people dead and another 53 people hospitalized.

The senior senator from Florida said he asked the FBI whether Omar Mateen had any ties to Islamic radicalism. Nelson said the FBI said there appear to be ties, but the agency remains naturally cautious and is waiting for the facts to emerge.

Nelson said he also checked with intelligence staff who believe there is some connection to ISIS, but that has not been officially confirmed.



""This appears to be an act of terrorism,"" said Nelson.

Nelson noted two successive shootings in the past two days. The fatal shooting of ""The Voice"" star Christina Grimmie at a concert in Orlando, and now this latest shooting, the worst in U.S. history, at a gay nightclub.



""What is happening to our country?"" asked Nelson.

Nelson says the FBI is asking anyone in the Fort Pierce and Port St. Lucie areas who knows Mateen to contact federal investigators.

But the rampage may also have set another disturbing precedent, marking the first large-scale attack inspired by Islamist extremism that successfully targeted the LGBT community in a Western country.

The shooter who stormed the Pulse nightclub, identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, declared his allegiance to the Islamic State in a 911 call shortly before he cut down dozens of people and set off a scene of unspeakable carnage that ended with his own death Sunday morning. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq “news agency,” but authorities said it was unclear if Mateen had clear links to the group, or if he was merely a lone wolf inspired by its propaganda.

Over the past year, the Islamic State has orchestrated major attacks in Paris and Brussels at concert halls, cafes, subway stations, and airports that aimed at killing as many people as possible in an arbitrary fashion. But the group has not previously singled out the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community in its deadly assaults in the West.

In Syria and Iraq, however, the group has brutally executed gay men in towns under its control, posting grisly videos of blindfolded victims being thrown off the roofs of buildings. At least 36 men have been killed by militants on the basis of draconian sodomy charges enforced by the Islamic State, according to OutRight Action International. In Bangladesh, Islamist militants have for years targeted gay bloggers, among others, for assassination; on Sunday, authorities there detained thousands of suspected militants in a pre-emptive raid.

President Barack Obama called the shooting “an act of terror and an act of hate” and noted that it occurred during Pride festivities across the country, an annual celebration of the LGBT community.

“The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing and to live,” Obama said Sunday at the White House. “So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.”

Obama said that authorities have “no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer,” or “what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups.”

The Islamic State claimed the gunman as one of its own: “The armed attack that targeted a gay nightclub in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida which left over 100 people dead or injured was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” the group’s Amaq agency said.

But Mateen’s father said his son never demonstrated much of an interest in radical Islamist doctrine or religion, though he had expressed anger recently over seeing two men kissing in Miami. And his ex-wife said Mateen had beat her and was mentally ill and unstable.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that a number of signs — including the Islamic State’s calls for attacks during Ramadan, the gunman’s declaration in his 911 call, and his targeting of a gay nightclub during Pride — indicated that the attack was “an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism.” He added: “Whether this attack was also ISIS-directed remains to be determined.”

Mateen was hardly unknown to federal authorities: The FBI investigated him on two separate occasions. In 2013, he came under suspicion for making inflammatory comments alleging he had ties to terrorists, but authorities could not find sufficient evidence to pin charges on him. Then, in 2014, the FBI looked at Mateen’s possible ties to a notorious figure, Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria.

The FBI concluded that the contact between the two men — who both lived in Fort Pierce, Florida — had been “minimal” and that Mateen “did not constitute a substantive threat at that time,” Ronald Hopper, assistant agent in charge of the FBI’s Tampa division, told reporters in Orlando.

Western governments have struggled to contain the fallout from hate-filled propaganda touting Islamist violence, even as the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate continues to shrink on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria, experts said.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi “knows if he calls for terror it will come,” said author Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “He doesn’t need any direct human connection or even a web connection. His message is so pervasive in the media and so simple it is certain to inspire the angry.”

There’s plenty of anger to stoke. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation are commonplace in the United States, but those attacks have not been on a large-scale or linked directly to foreign terrorist groups or their propaganda. A 1990 bombing of a gay bar in Greenwich Village in New York that injured three people was eventually blamed on a suspected Islamist terrorist.

According to the FBI’s most recent statistics, in 2014, hate crimes against gay Americans accounted for more than 18 percent of the 1,017 such incidents across the country, with about 2 percent occurring in gay bars or nightclubs.

Orlando’s tragedy threw the 2016 election into stark relief Sunday, drawing markedly different responses from the two presumptive presidential nominees, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state emphasized it was both terrorism and a hate crime, while Trump initially made no mention of the LGBT community and accepted “congratulations” from his Twitter followers for having foreseen an attack.

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,” the Republican tweeted. “We must be smart!” Later Sunday, he piled on, calling for the president’s resignation and for Clinton to drop out of the presidential race. In a final statement Sunday evening, he said, “Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans,” concluding, “We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.”

Trump’s campaign said he’ll give a speech Monday on the attack, immigration, and national security.

Clinton, a Democrat who has made national security central to her campaign, vowed to continue the Obama administration’s fight against the Islamic State and its ilk, stressing the role of multinational coalitions and the need to upend terrorist recruitment networks. “It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,” she said, promising as well to fight for the rights of the LGBT community.

“Hate has absolutely no place in America,” Clinton said. “To the LGBT community: Please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them.”

Beyond the politics of the presidential race, in Orlando, the attack has left a sense of disbelief, pain, and outrage.

“There’s a lot of anger,” Florida State Sen. Darren Soto, who represents Orlando, told Foreign Policy on Sunday. “Many of us woke up shocked to find our happy little town was the site of the largest mass shooting in American history.”

“We have a large and proud gay community here that’s a fundamental part of our culture, and for them to be targeted in a potentially international terrorist attack is just upsetting and mind-boggling.”",The Florida attack could mark a dangerous new tactic for Islamic State-inspired extremists — singling out the LGBT community in the West.

50 people were killed, and 53 others injured at a LGBT nighclub in Orlando early Sunday morning.



According to multiple news reports, Omar Mateen was identified as the gunman who opened fire at Pulse Nightclub. Investigators in a press conference confirmed they recovered a handgun and an AR-15 type of assault rifle.

Speaking from the White House, Obama says the United States has to decide if that is the ""country we want to be."" He says that doing nothing is a decision as well.

Flags were ordered to fly at half staff.

The shooting has thrust the topic of gun control back into focus as a presidential election nears.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has called for expanding background checks to sales at gun shows and online purchases, and for reinstating a ban on assault weapons. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said the existing background check system should be fixed, not expanded, and that assault-weapons bans do not work.

The White House released the following statement after news of the shooting broke:

Florida Gov. Rick Scott said authorities were working to contact family members of the victims who were killed and injured in the shooting.

In Syria and Iraq, however, the group has brutally executed gay men in towns under its control, posting grisly videos of blindfolded victims being thrown off the roofs of buildings. At least 36 men have been killed by militants on the basis of draconian sodomy charges enforced by the Islamic State, according to OutRight Action International. In Bangladesh, Islamist militants have for years targeted gay bloggers, among others, for assassination; on Sunday, authorities there detained thousands of suspected militants in a pre-emptive raid.

President Barack Obama called the shooting “an act of terror and an act of hate” and noted that it occurred during Pride festivities across the country, an annual celebration of the LGBT community.

“The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing and to live,” Obama said Sunday at the White House. “So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.”

Obama said that authorities have “no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer,” or “what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups.”

The Islamic State claimed the gunman as one of its own: “The armed attack that targeted a gay nightclub in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida which left over 100 people dead or injured was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” the group’s Amaq agency said.

But Mateen’s father said his son never demonstrated much of an interest in radical Islamist doctrine or religion, though he had expressed anger recently over seeing two men kissing in Miami. And his ex-wife said Mateen had beat her and was mentally ill and unstable.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that a number of signs — including the Islamic State’s calls for attacks during Ramadan, the gunman’s declaration in his 911 call, and his targeting of a gay nightclub during Pride — indicated that the attack was “an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism.” He added: “Whether this attack was also ISIS-directed remains to be determined.”

Mateen was hardly unknown to federal authorities: The FBI investigated him on two separate occasions. In 2013, he came under suspicion for making inflammatory comments alleging he had ties to terrorists, but authorities could not find sufficient evidence to pin charges on him. Then, in 2014, the FBI looked at Mateen’s possible ties to a notorious figure, Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria.

The FBI concluded that the contact between the two men — who both lived in Fort Pierce, Florida — had been “minimal” and that Mateen “did not constitute a substantive threat at that time,” Ronald Hopper, assistant agent in charge of the FBI’s Tampa division, told reporters in Orlando.

Western governments have struggled to contain the fallout from hate-filled propaganda touting Islamist violence, even as the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate continues to shrink on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria, experts said.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi “knows if he calls for terror it will come,” said author Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “He doesn’t need any direct human connection or even a web connection. His message is so pervasive in the media and so simple it is certain to inspire the angry.”

There’s plenty of anger to stoke. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation are commonplace in the United States, but those attacks have not been on a large-scale or linked directly to foreign terrorist groups or their propaganda. A 1990 bombing of a gay bar in Greenwich Village in New York that injured three people was eventually blamed on a suspected Islamist terrorist.

According to the FBI’s most recent statistics, in 2014, hate crimes against gay Americans accounted for more than 18 percent of the 1,017 such incidents across the country, with about 2 percent occurring in gay bars or nightclubs.

Orlando’s tragedy threw the 2016 election into stark relief Sunday, drawing markedly different responses from the two presumptive presidential nominees, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state emphasized it was both terrorism and a hate crime, while Trump initially made no mention of the LGBT community and accepted “congratulations” from his Twitter followers for having foreseen an attack.

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,” the Republican tweeted. “We must be smart!” Later Sunday, he piled on, calling for the president’s resignation and for Clinton to drop out of the presidential race. In a final statement Sunday evening, he said, “Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans,” concluding, “We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.”

Trump’s campaign said he’ll give a speech Monday on the attack, immigration, and national security.

Clinton, a Democrat who has made national security central to her campaign, vowed to continue the Obama administration’s fight against the Islamic State and its ilk, stressing the role of multinational coalitions and the need to upend terrorist recruitment networks. “It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,” she said, promising as well to fight for the rights of the LGBT community.

“Hate has absolutely no place in America,” Clinton said. “To the LGBT community: Please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them.”

Beyond the politics of the presidential race, in Orlando, the attack has left a sense of disbelief, pain, and outrage.

“There’s a lot of anger,” Florida State Sen. Darren Soto, who represents Orlando, told Foreign Policy on Sunday. “Many of us woke up shocked to find our happy little town was the site of the largest mass shooting in American history.”

“We have a large and proud gay community here that’s a fundamental part of our culture, and for them to be targeted in a potentially international terrorist attack is just upsetting and mind-boggling.”",The Florida attack could mark a dangerous new tactic for Islamic State-inspired extremists — singling out the LGBT community in the West.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

ORLANDO, Florida — Omar Saddiqui Mateen was the gunman who opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, killing at least 50 people, two law enforcement officials told CNN.

The shooter, 29, who was killed by police, is from Fort Pierce, Florida, the officials said.

A law enforcement source told CNN that Mateen worked as a private security guard. He rented a car and drove to Orlando to carry out the attack, the source said.

The shooter’s father told NBC News that his son was enraged after seeing two men kissing recently.

FBI teams and local law enforcement are working to clear Mateen’s apartment, a federal law enforcement source said.

Agents are going through the apartment with bomb squads and investigating the materials there, the source said.

Law enforcement sources told CNN that the suspect had possible explosive devices strapped to his body and in his vehicle, but a U.S. official said later that no explosives were found.

At least nine officers were involved in the shootout, Mina said. Several coroner vans were seen traveling toward the nightclub.

One officer suffered an eye injury when a bullet struck his Kevlar helmet, said Danny Banks, special agent in charge of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Orlando bureau. The helmet saved the officer’s life, Banks said.

The shooter is not from the Orlando area, Mina said. He has been identified as Omar Saddiqui Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, about 120 miles southeast of Orlando, two law enforcement officials tell CNN.

Orlando authorities said they consider the violence an act of domestic terror. The FBI is involved. While investigators are exploring all angles, they “have suggestions the individual has leanings towards (Islamic terrorism), but right now we can’t say definitely,” said Ron Hopper, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Orlando bureau.

Authorities are also looking into the possibility the attack was a hate crime, a law enforcement source told CNN.

The shooting began around 2 a.m., and an officer who was working at the club responded, Mina said. The officer engaged in a shootout outside the club, after which the gunman ran into the club.

Authorities were getting calls from people inside the club but away from the gunman, the chief said.

More police rushed to the scene and broke down a door with an armored vehicle, helping some 30 club-goers flee to safety, Mina said. At that point police shot and killed the gunman, he said.

“It’s just shocking,” said Christopher Hansen, who was inside Pulse. He heard gunshots, “just one after another after another. It could have lasted a whole song,” he said.

Hansen was getting a drink at the bar when he “just saw bodies going down,” he said.

When the shots erupted, he hit the ground, crawling on his elbows and knees, before he spotted a man who had been shot.

“I took my bandana off and shoved it in the hole in his back,” Hansen said, adding that he saw another woman who appeared to be shot in the arm.

The nightclub posted on its Facebook page shortly after the violence began: “Everyone get out of Pulse and keep running.”

Orlando police warned residents to stay away from the area, and urged people not to call their offices. They declined to provide the number of casualties, saying details will be available later. Bomb sniffing dogs are on the scene.

Pulse describes itself as “the hottest gay bar” in the heart of Orlando. Hours before the shooting, the club urged party-goers to attend its “Latin flavor” event Saturday night.

Jovial, well-dressed crowds heeded the call in an event that turned into a nightmare.

“It was just, bang, bang, bang!” party-goer Hansen said of the gunfire.

Ricardo Negron Almodovar said he was in the club when the shooting started about 2 a.m. He barely escaped.

“People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran,” he posted on the club’s Facebook page.

“I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well.”

Anthony Torres, who was at the club, said he and his friends were leaving the club when the shots were fired just after last call, as the club was nearing closing time.

“The shots did not sound like a regular handgun. It sounded like it was shooting repetitively and it wouldn’t stop,” said Torres, who added that he saw at least 10 people who had been shot.

Tearful relatives waited outside the club as lights from police cars flashed in the background. Some implored the media to help them get word on their loved ones.

The sound of gunshots echoed beyond the club.

Jose Torres was clocking in to work at a Dunkin’ Donuts across the street when he heard them.

“It was something that I never heard before,” Torres said. “I had to run inside the store, and I saw just a lot of people screaming, crying. Just screaming and coming out running like crazy.”

Torres said he ducked into the Dunkin’ Donuts and called 911 as several people dashed out of the club, bleeding. Police and SWAT teams rushed to the scene.

“They don’t let nobody in or out,” he said. “The SWAT team is inside there.”

Authorities have conducted a controlled explosion near the nightclub, according to Orlando police.

Tom Fuentes, a CNN law enforcement analyst, said controlled explosions are used to breach a door or when a subject is barricaded in a room and police want to use a stun grenade to temporarily freeze their central nervous system.

FBI agents were also assisting at the scene, agency spokeswoman Amy Pittman said. President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting and asked the FBI and other federal officials to provide him with regular updates, a statement said.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted, “My prayers are with the victims’ families & all those affected by the shooting in Orlando. We will devote every resource available to assist.”",[protected-iframe id=”960fb9ea9e9a70ee304be7f5959140f4-28572344-29056055″ info=” width=”560″ height=”315″ frameborder=”0″ allowfullscreen=&#822…

It is the worst mass shooting in America's history and was soon called an ""act of domestic terrorism"". The gunman has been named as Omar Mateen, a New York-born US citizen of Afghan descent. He was armed with an AR-15 assault rifle, a handgun, and a device police originally feared was a bomb.

He was killed after a shootout with police. Mateen had taken hostages for three hours but was shot dead after a SWAT team entered the Pulse club, a popular bar and dance club with members from the LGBT community. Until Sunday, the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in April 2007 during which 32 people were killed and another 30 injured was the country's worst attack of its kind.

Mateen apparently called 911 shortly before the massacre began during which he pledged allegiance to ""the leader of Isis [Isil]"", according to NBC citing law enforcement sources. A state of emergency was also declared a few hours after the attack in the city of Orlando, the governor said. His Afghan-born father, Mir Seddique, who is a television presenter and reportedly a strong supporter of the Afghan Taliban, said Mateen had expressed anger at seeing two men kissing.

The FBI were aware of him, but had not opened an investigation – and still he was working as a security guard. He carried a weapon as part of his job, apparently guarding a retirement home in southern Florida. “We are saying we are apologising for the whole incident,” the father added. “We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.” The attack, he said, “has nothing to do with religion"". What do we know about Mateen? Mateen had pledged his allegiance to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) and was said to have been angered by the sight of two men kissing. Mateen, 29, had worked as a security guard in Florida and was thought to be living in the Port St Lucie area. Global security services firm G4S said on Sunday that Omar Mateen had worked for the company since 2007.

""Mateen underwent company screening and background checks when he was recruited in 2007 and the check revealed nothing of concern,"" a company spokeswoman said in a statement. ""His screening was repeated in 2013 with no findings."" He was investigated by the FBI for ten months after he alarmed co-workers in 2013 by claiming to be a member of Hizbollah and have family ties to al-Qaeda.

James Comey, the FBI director, said the agency interviewed Mateen, sent in undercover agents and trailed him during the course of a ten month investigation. Mateen admitted at the time that he had told colleagues he was affiliated with the terrorist groups, but said he only made the comments ""in anger"" because he felt persecuted for being Muslim. He was again investigated in 2014 after being linked to a man who became a suicide bomber in Syria. The men attended the same mosque and knew each other, but the FBI determined that they had no significant relationship. Mateen was placed on the FBI’s terror watch list for the duration of the first investigation but never arrested. Meanwhile, he continued to work for G4S, the British security company which hired him in 2007, and legally carry guns. There were no shortage of red flags, according to a former co-worker who described Mateen as racist, sexist, homophobic and frighteningly aggressive saying, ""I'm not surprised at what he did"". Daniel Gilroy, the former colleague, described Mateen as ""unhinged"". ""Everything he said was toxic and the company wouldn't do anything,"" Mr Gilroy told Florida Today. ""This guy was unhinged and unstable. He talked of killing people.""

The pair had met online around eight years ago, and she moved to Florida to marry him. “He was not a stable person,” she said. “He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.” They divorced in 2011, according to Florida court records seen by the Washington Post.

Isil appeared to claim responsibility for the attack in a message published on the group’s semi-official news agency, Amaq. They described Mateen as a “soldier of the caliphate”. Currently it is not fully known how Mateen is linked to Isil and the statement did not clarify this either. However, it seems that Mateen is viewed by Isil as a lone wolf attacker. He had a licence for concealed carry – in Florida, you do not require a permit to carry a weapon, but you do to conceal it. He also had a licence to work as a security guard. It was not clear when those permits were issued. He was known to the police, having become “a person of interest” in 2013 and again in 2014.

Who are the victims? The city of Orlando released the names of ten people killed in the attack. ""Our city is working tirelessly to get as much information out to the families so they can begin the grieving process. Please keep the following individuals in your thoughts and prayers. #PrayforOrlando.""

Last night's mass murder comes on the heels of the shooting death in Orlando of Christina Grimmie, a contestant on “The Voice,” who was gunned down by a deranged stranger after a concert in Orlando on Friday night. And it comes two years after a man attempted to murder scores of people in a packed Seattle gay bar on New Years Eve. And it comes one year after a white supremacist gunned down nine African Americans prayer group members at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. And six months after a gunman — cranked up by rightwing lies about Planned Parenthood (""baby parts"") — killed five people at a clinic in Colorado Springs.

Pulse was hosting an 18+ night for the Latinx community when Mateen burst in, shot scores of people, and took a large group of hostages.

Mateen was killed by a SWAT team that moved in to rescue the hostages. Omar Mateen reportedly used the same weapon — an AR-15 assault rifle — that was used by the killers at Sandy Hook and San Bernardino. The NRA has already come to the defense of this innocent gun:

Federal law enforcement officials said they had found no indication so far that the attacker was linked to any wider organization, though they and the police were investigating several possible terrorism angles, both overseas and in the United States. Past terrorist attacks, like the massacre in December in San Bernardino, Calif., were carried out in the name of Islam by people who were “self-radicalized,” apparently having no direct ties to any organization but inspired by groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. The Islamic State in particular has encouraged “lone wolf” attacks in the West, specifically the United States, a point reinforced recently by the group’s spokesman in his annual pre-Ramadan speech. Noting that some supporters have lamented that they cannot strike at military targets, he took pains to explain why killing civilians in the land of the infidel is not just permitted but encouraged.

You know they're doing backflips at Fox News, Drudge, and Trump HQ. And so they are:



The men reportedly kissed in view of Mateen and his three-year-old son. The shooter was incensed because... how do you explain two men kissing to a three-year-old boy? Um... how do you explain that same little boy that his father is—was—the man who committed the deadliest mass shooting in US history?

We call on members of the clergy—imams, priests, rabbis, pastors—to examine their own hands for evidence of blood. This kind of murderous homophobia doesn't come from nowhere.

In the early hours of Sunday morning, the biggest mass shooting in American history took place at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, and left 50 dead and at least 52 injured.

The atrocity has become the deadliest mass shooting in American history.

The DC Capital Pride Festival will “go on as planned” today, reports the Washington Blade.

Capital Pride President Bernie Delia said: “We deplore the wanton and senseless act of terrorism in Orlando, Florida earlier this morning, and our thoughts are with the victims, their families and the people of central Florida,” Delia said in a statement.

“Capital Pride will observe a moment of silence from the Capital Stage at 1 p.m. in remembrance of the victims,” Delia added.

After the moment’s silence, the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington will sing the national anthem as planned.

Delia added:“We will not give in to terrorism… That’s what they want.”

He continued:“Today’s Capital Pride Festival and Concert will go on as planned. We have every confidence in the security we are able to provide at our events, in large part because of our cooperative partnership with local and federal law enforcement agencies in the Washington, D.C. area, and the strong measures that are already in place for the city.”

The Mayor of Washington DC, Muriel Bowser released a statement reading: “Ahead of today’s Capital Pride Festival, I have been brief by MPD Chief Cathy Lanier about increased security measures.

“Today, as always, we will not be deterred by hate as we gather to celebrate love.”

With more than a hundred now confirmed dead or injured, the shooting has become the worst in American history – the second worst killing would be the Virginia Tech shooting of 2007, which left 32 people dead and 17 injured.

After that is the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook which left 20 children and six adults dead.

Omar Mateen was named as the shooter in the incident which killed at least 50.

The US citizen’s parents are from Afghanistan, and FBI agent Ron Hopper spoke to reporters to say that he may have leanings towards Islamic extremism.

But his father said the incident was not religiously motivated.

The shooter, a resident of Port St Lucie, Florida, was killed after a “gun battle” with police officers in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Now Mateen’s father has apologised for the incident, saying he did not think his son was religiously motivated.

He also said that his son, 29, got angry a few months ago after he saw two men kiss in Orlando.

The shooter, a resident of Port St Lucie, Florida, was killed after a “gun battle” with police officers in the early hours of Sunday morning.

His identity was revealed by CBS News, the Washington Post, and NBC News. The BBC suggests that although he was not on a terrorist watch-list, he may have been being investigated for a previous crime.",A major Pride event will go ahead in Washington DC despite the increased security risk following a mass shooting which left 50 dead and more than 50 injured at a Florida gay club.

Before the shooting early Sunday, Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce, Fla., allegedly called 911 to align himself with the militant group, officials told CNN and NBC News.

Orlando, Fla., Mayor Buddy Dyer said that at least 50 people were killed and 53 more were hospitalized, making Sunday's attack at the Pulse nightclub the deadliest shooting in U.S. history.

""It's absolutely terrible ... 50 victims in one location, one shooting. Absolutely one of the worst tragedies we've seen,"" Orlando Police Chief John Mina said.

Before Sunday, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history was when a gunman opened fire on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, Va., killing 32 people in 2007.

Dozens of people were taken hostage inside the nightclub between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Sunday morning by a gunman carrying an assault rifle and a handgun.

Orlando police tweeted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives stated Mateen purchased the firearms legally in Florida within the past week.

In an afternoon press conference, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper told reporters his agency took the lead on the investigation and that the FBI had been aware of Mateen since 2013 when he made ""inflammatory comments"" to coworkers that ""alleged possible terrorist ties.""

""The FBI thoroughly investigated the matter, including interviews of witnesses, physical surveillance and records checks,"" he said.

Mateen was interviewed twice during this time, but Hopper said the investigation was closed after the FBI was ""unable to verify the substance of his comments.""

He was interviewed by the FBI again in 2014 for possible ties to American suicide bomber Moner Abu-Salha, but determined that their contact was ""minimal"" and ""did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time.""

Earlier in the day, Hopper said the FBI was considering multiple motives for the shooting.

""At this point in time we're just conducting a general investigation, period,"" Hopper told reporters. ""We'll determine whether officially if its a hate crime, or a terrorism incident or even a violent crime once we have all the facts in place.""

Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for Orange County after the shooting.

""You just can't imagine this would happen to our community, our state or anywhere in our country,"" Scott told reporters. ""For somebody to go in there and be an active shooter and take that number of lives and injure that many people is clearly an act of terror. ""

Officers killed the gunman Mateen, in a series of shootouts in which one officer sustained a head injury after a bullet hit his helmet.

The officers involved in the shootout were relieved of their duty and will be investigated by the Florida department of law enforcement, in what Mina said was standard practice.

An explosion was reported in the area of the nightclub but police described it as ""a controlled explosion by law enforcement.""

Orlando police bomb squad arrived at the scene to search the area and remove any ""devices"" similar to the one worn by the gunman that may have been placed inside the club.

""Tonight, we had a crime that will have a lasting effect on our community,"" Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said in a news conference.

Dyer said said that he contacted the White House, which granted a request to waive Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -- or HIPPA law -- in order to allow hospitals to contact the families of the injured.

It's unclear why Pulse -- which describes itself as a gay nightclub -- was targeted in the attack.

Terry DeCarlo, director of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Community Center of Central Florida, told the Orlando Sentinel the community was shocked and angered.

""This just makes no sense,"" he said. ""This was an attack on the LGBT community.""

Pulse describes itself as ""the hottest gay bar"" in Orlando and and was planning a ""Latin flavor"" event Saturday night.

Co-owner Barbara Poma opened Pulse in 2004 in memory of her brother John, who died of AIDS in 1991.

Of the fatalities, 39 victims and Mateen were pronounced dead at the site and two bodies were found in the parking lot, Dyer said. Another eleven people were taken to hospitals and pronounced dead there, he said.

Forty-three of the injured were transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center, a hospital spokesperson said, with 26 operations being performed.

The city of Orlando released the names of the first eight fatalities: Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34; Stanley Almodovar III, 23; Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20; Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22; Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36; Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz, 22; Luis S.

A tear-filled count to 50 — and above — to remember the slain ended the evening. “47… 48… 49…”

Earlier in the night, Ed Murray, Seattle’s first openly gay mayor, addressed the crowd and struck a defiant tone. “We will, as we have in the past, face this fear,” Murray said. “We will not be intimidated.”

“I can say unequivocally this: There are seven million Washington hearts in Orlando tonight,” Governor Jay Inslee said.

“Hatred is a common virus, it affects us all.”

Hundreds of candles were joined by hundreds and hundreds more flashing phone lights as the dead were remembered.

In the crowd, people told CHS they heard about the vigil through social media and from community centers like Broadway’s All Pilgrims Church. One woman told CHS she just knew there would be a gathering on Capitol Hill. “This is what pride looks like,” Barbara Elza said with a rainbow flag fastened like a cape around her neck. “This is how strong we are.”

The Seattle Men’s Chorus and Seattle Women’s Chorus lead the crowd in song at one point joining a bagpiper across the park for Amazing Grace. A somber medley featuring What a Wonderful World helped bring the vigil to an end. A giant Pride flag was unfurled across the crowd as the vigil drew to a close.

Afterwards, candles and signs from the vigil decorated a stone wall on the park’s southern edge in memorial.

UPDATE: The City of Seattle is streaming the vigil



 Community groups are organizing a candlelight vigil in Cal Anderson Park Sunday night after a terrible shooting at an Orlando, Florida nightclub killed at least 50 people:

A gunman carrying a handgun and an assault-style weapon opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., early Sunday, killing at least 50 people and wounding at least 53 others. It is the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. The death toll far exceeds initial estimates. Orlando Police Chief John Mina initially said “around 20” people succumbed to gunshot wounds inside the Pulse Orlando nightclub, but later said police found far more victims once they gained full access to the scene. He said the suspected gunman is also dead.

The vigil is slated to begin at 8 PM. The Pride Foundation announced the vigil Sunday morning as Seattle awoke to news of the horrific events in Florida. UPDATE: Representatives from the Sisters of the Mother House of Washington say they will be on hand at the park starting at 6 PM “for those who feel the need to arrive early and be around community.”

Governor Jay Inslee and Mayor Ed Murray are slated to attend. They will be joined by officials including State Senator Jamie Pedersen, community leader Sarah Davis, Luis Fernando Ramirez of Entre Hermanos, Monisha Harrell of Equal Rights Washington Michael Ramos of Church Council of Greater Seattle, and Connie Burk of The NW Network, according to a City of Seattle announcement.",

The city's mayor Buddy Dyer declared a state of emergency while police described the incident, the worst mass shooting in recent American history, as an act of terrorism.

Officials named Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old man from Fort Pierce Florida, as the gunman and said the killings were likely to be ideologically motivated.

At 2am on Sunday an officer engaged in a gun battle with Mateen after he opened fire in the club and started taking hostages.

In a bid to rescue hostages, police set off two “distractionary devices” at approximately 5am that blew apart a wall so a Swat team could enter the club. The suspect was killed in the gunfight.

Dyer said: ""Today we're dealing with something that we never imagined and is unimaginable.

""Because of the scale of the crime I've asked the [Florida] governor to declare a state of emergency.

""We're also issuing a state of emergency for the city of Orlando so that we can bring additional resources to bear to deal with the aftermath.""","At least 50 people are believed to have been killed and 53 injured following a shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

The venue promoted gay rights and put on events supporting happenings in the gay community, ranging from Come Out with Pride to Gay Games, according to the club’s website.

Pulse’s patrons and others in Orlando’s gay community were reeling on Sunday after a gunman killed 50 people and wounded 53 others overnight in what police said was a targeted, well-planned attack.

The shooter, who held off police for three hours before a SWAT team killed him, was identified as Omar S. Mateen, a Florida resident who might have had leanings toward Islamic State militants, a senior FBI official said.

Pulse is one of the Florida city’s five gay bars, a hub for Latin music, drag performances, diva nights, bar dancers, drinks served by muscular bartenders and wild fun.

“This is a week I’ll be going to funerals all week long. I don’t even know who was there, but I know I’ll know them,” said Raymond Michael Sharpe, 55, a bartender at another gay bar, who has spoken to Pulse employees and patrons who survived the shooting.

He said Poma is alive, as was Pulse manager Cindy Barbalock, who got out and got home. Reuters was not able to reach Poma by phone on Sunday and Legler declined to speak when he was contacted.

Hundreds of people sent prayers, thoughts and condolences on the club’s Facebook site.

Pulse bartender Juan Orrego said on his Facebook page: “I’m home. OK. I only got shot in the leg. Thank u everybody for your prayers.”

The shooting happened at 2:00 a.m., toward the end of one of the club’s popular Latin nights, with bachata, merengue and salsa music. Many of the family members seeking their loved ones at local hospitals after the shooting were Hispanic.

One regular said he lost friends who were frequent patrons.

“There were faces we had seen all the time,” Luis Burbano told CNN, describing how he and his friends got out alive and tried to help the wounded. “We heard about mutual friends who did not make it.”

“One of our longtime bartender friends was in a small little fitting room with 10 other people, hiding in there, waiting for a miracle, waiting for someone to come in and rescue them.”","The co-owner of Pulse, the Orlando gay nightclub that became the scene of the worst mass shooting in US history on Sunday, founded the club to honour her brother who died of AIDS and to support the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community."

Last night's mass murder comes on the heels of the shooting death in Orlando of Christina Grimmie, a contestant on “The Voice,” who was gunned down by a deranged stranger after a concert in Orlando on Friday night. And it comes two years after a man attempted to murder scores of people in a packed Seattle gay bar on New Years Eve. And it comes one year after a white supremacist gunned down nine African Americans prayer group members at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. And six months after a gunman — cranked up by rightwing lies about Planned Parenthood (""baby parts"") — killed five people at a clinic in Colorado Springs.

Pulse was hosting an 18+ night for the Latinx community when Mateen burst in, shot scores of people, and took a large group of hostages.

Mateen was killed by a SWAT team that moved in to rescue the hostages. Omar Mateen reportedly used the same weapon — an AR-15 assault rifle — that was used by the killers at Sandy Hook and San Bernardino. The NRA has already come to the defense of this innocent gun:

Federal law enforcement officials said they had found no indication so far that the attacker was linked to any wider organization, though they and the police were investigating several possible terrorism angles, both overseas and in the United States. Past terrorist attacks, like the massacre in December in San Bernardino, Calif., were carried out in the name of Islam by people who were “self-radicalized,” apparently having no direct ties to any organization but inspired by groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. The Islamic State in particular has encouraged “lone wolf” attacks in the West, specifically the United States, a point reinforced recently by the group’s spokesman in his annual pre-Ramadan speech. Noting that some supporters have lamented that they cannot strike at military targets, he took pains to explain why killing civilians in the land of the infidel is not just permitted but encouraged.

You know they're doing backflips at Fox News, Drudge, and Trump HQ. And so they are:



The men reportedly kissed in view of Mateen and his three-year-old son. The shooter was incensed because... how do you explain two men kissing to a three-year-old boy?

Last night's mass murder comes on the heels of the shooting death in Orlando of Christina Grimmie, a contestant on “The Voice,” who was gunned down by a deranged stranger after a concert in Orlando on Friday night. And it comes two years after a man attempted to murder scores of people in a packed Seattle gay bar on New Years Eve. And it comes one year after a white supremacist gunned down nine African Americans prayer group members at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. And six months after a gunman — cranked up by rightwing lies about Planned Parenthood (""baby parts"") — killed five people at a clinic in Colorado Springs.

Pulse was hosting an 18+ night for the Latinx community when Mateen burst in, shot scores of people, and took a large group of hostages.

Mateen was killed by a SWAT team that moved in to rescue the hostages. Omar Mateen reportedly used the same weapon — an AR-15 assault rifle — that was used by the killers at Sandy Hook and San Bernardino. The NRA has already come to the defense of this innocent gun:

Federal law enforcement officials said they had found no indication so far that the attacker was linked to any wider organization, though they and the police were investigating several possible terrorism angles, both overseas and in the United States. Past terrorist attacks, like the massacre in December in San Bernardino, Calif., were carried out in the name of Islam by people who were “self-radicalized,” apparently having no direct ties to any organization but inspired by groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. The Islamic State in particular has encouraged “lone wolf” attacks in the West, specifically the United States, a point reinforced recently by the group’s spokesman in his annual pre-Ramadan speech. Noting that some supporters have lamented that they cannot strike at military targets, he took pains to explain why killing civilians in the land of the infidel is not just permitted but encouraged.

You know they're doing backflips at Fox News, Drudge, and Trump HQ. And so they are:



The men reportedly kissed in view of Mateen and his three-year-old son. The shooter was incensed because... how do you explain two men kissing to a three-year-old boy? Um... how do you explain that same little boy that his father is—was—the man who committed the deadliest mass shooting in US history?

We call on members of the clergy—imams, priests, rabbis, pastors—to examine their own hands for evidence of blood. This kind of murderous homophobia doesn't come from nowhere.

Oh, look. A couple of religious bigots took to Twitter this morning to celebrate the carnage:

I have no idea who @falconqaeda is. But Dan Patrick—who blamed the victims for their own deaths—is the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, a Republican elected official. Patrick deleted the offending tweet and replaced it with this equally offensive tweet: ""Have a blessed Sunday!""

In the coming days, there will be a lot of discussion about terrorism and mass shootings and the relationship between these categories. And it’s growing harder to separate them: Terror attacks in the U.S. increasingly involve guns.... Experts say the increased use of guns in terror attacks is an alarming trend. Arie Perliger, director of terrorism studies at the U.S. Military Academy, said that U.S. terrorists are turning to guns because since Sept. 11, the federal government has monitored the use of explosives and the trade of materials that can be turned into explosives.3 People on the terrorism watch list aren’t barred from buying guns, by contrast, although such a ban probably wouldn’t have stopped the Charleston or San Bernardino shootings, because the suspects weren’t on the watch list.

Here's the advice Adam Gadahn, senior adviser to Osama Bin Laden and top al-Qaida propagandist, gave to wannabe Islamic terrorists living in the United States in 2011:

Ban assault weapons — not just for people on the terrorism watch list, but for all people, period. And mentally unstable people who commit acts of domestic violence shouldn't be allowed to purchase or own guns of any sort.","There will be a vigil for the victims of the Orlando terror attack in Cal Anderson Park tonight at 8 PM.

It was a stark contrast to the club's previous post, seven hours earlier, inviting ""Latinos, Latinas & everyone that loves a little Latin flavor"" to swing by Saturday night for an evening of fun.

They didn't know then the club would become the scene of the deadliest shooting in U.S. history, with 50 people killed, 53 others injured and the gunman dead in a shootout
• 50 dead in worst U.S. mass shooting at Florida nightclub

As the chaotic scene unfolded, staff, patrons and passersby took to social media to describe what they saw.

A man named Brandon Wolf tweeted in the midst of the shooting that he was hiding in the bathroom and unable to find his friends.

Three hours later, he posted that he'd managed to escape the nightclub safely. Others, he said, were not so lucky.

Another man, who describes himself in his Twitter bio as an ER physician assistant, posted a clip from outside the club.

He said he'd been celebrating at Pulse with a friend for her birthday. The pair managed to escape out the back, he said, though his friend was shot in the shoulder.

Another man posted video from what appears to be just down the street from the club. The sound of gunfire, a fast burst of at least 20 shots, can be heard ringing out.

As the chaos died down on Sunday morning and details of the shooting emerged, tributes for the victims began pouring in on social media under the hashtags #PrayForOrlando and #ImWithYou.

'Out of nowhere, bang, bang, bang, bang'

Orlando resident Justin Barnes was stopped in his car at a red light near the nightclub when the first round of gunfire erupted.

""People were screaming and yelling and the officer that was there, he was firing his weapon at the guy and yelling 'get the f--k out of the way.' People were running past my car,"" he told CBC News.

""One lady was dragging her leg and she was bleeding,"" Barnes said. ""I could literally smell gunpowder from where my car was sitting.""

Barnes said he got out of his car to try to help victims get away safely, but later fled when the gunman began shooting in his direction.

""I saw like five people drop like balloons in front of me,"" he said, visibly shaken and struggling to find his words during his interview with CBC's John Northcott.

""I wasn't affected by it physically, but I'm telling you man, I'll be affected by this mentally for the rest of my life. I've never seen anybody die in my life.""

""I just saw bodies going down,"" said customer Chris Hansen, who was ordering a drink from the bar when the shooting began.

""I fell down. I crawled out. People were trying to escape out the back.""

Outside, Hansen helped a man who had been shot in the back by placing a bandana on his wound to stem the bleeding. He also helped a woman who was shot in the arm.

'No one can tell me where my son is'

One woman whose son was in the club told reporters she's since texted and called his phone, with no response.

""I don't know where my son is. No one can tell me where my son is, if he's been shot, if he's dead, no one knows,"" she said through tears.

She said other witnesses saw her son's boyfriend being taken away from the scene in an ambulance with multiple gunshots.","As the deadliest shooting in U.S. history unfolded inside an Orlando nightclub early Sunday morning, staff, patron and passersby took to social media to describe the chaotic scene."

The venue promoted gay rights and put on events supporting happenings in the gay community, ranging from Come Out with Pride to Gay Games, according to the club’s website.

Pulse’s patrons and others in Orlando’s gay community were reeling on Sunday after a gunman killed 50 people and wounded 53 others overnight in what police said was a targeted, well-planned attack.

The shooter, who held off police for three hours before a SWAT team killed him, was identified as Omar S. Mateen, a Florida resident who might have had leanings toward Islamic State militants, a senior FBI official said.

Pulse is one of the Florida city’s five gay bars, a hub for Latin music, drag performances, diva nights, bar dancers, drinks served by muscular bartenders and wild fun.

“This is a week I’ll be going to funerals all week long. I don’t even know who was there, but I know I’ll know them,” said Raymond Michael Sharpe, 55, a bartender at another gay bar, who has spoken to Pulse employees and patrons who survived the shooting.

He said Poma is alive, as was Pulse manager Cindy Barbalock, who got out and got home. Reuters was not able to reach Poma by phone on Sunday and Legler declined to speak when he was contacted.

Hundreds of people sent prayers, thoughts and condolences on the club’s Facebook site.

Pulse bartender Juan Orrego said on his Facebook page: “I’m home. OK. I only got shot in the leg. Thank u everybody for your prayers.”

The shooting happened at 2:00 a.m., toward the end of one of the club’s popular Latin nights, with bachata, merengue and salsa music. Many of the family members seeking their loved ones at local hospitals after the shooting were Hispanic.

One regular said he lost friends who were frequent patrons.

“There were faces we had seen all the time,” Luis Burbano told CNN, describing how he and his friends got out alive and tried to help the wounded. “We heard about mutual friends who did not make it.”

“One of our longtime bartender friends was in a small little fitting room with 10 other people, hiding in there, waiting for a miracle, waiting for someone to come in and rescue them.”","The co-owner of Pulse, the Orlando gay nightclub that became the scene of the worst mass shooting in US history on Sunday, founded the club to honour her brother who died of AIDS and to support the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community."

The city's mayor Buddy Dyer declared a state of emergency while police described the incident, the worst mass shooting in recent American history, as an act of terrorism.

Officials named Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old man from Fort Pierce Florida, as the gunman and said the killings were likely to be ideologically motivated.

At 2am on Sunday an officer engaged in a gun battle with Mateen after he opened fire in the club and started taking hostages.

In a bid to rescue hostages, police set off two “distractionary devices” at approximately 5am that blew apart a wall so a Swat team could enter the club. The suspect was killed in the gunfight.

Dyer said: ""Today we're dealing with something that we never imagined and is unimaginable.

“It just made me sick,” said state Sen. Beth Bye of West Hartford. “Many of us have felt discrimination and had people loathe us. It is a hate crime and it is a terrorist attack. It is meant to put terror in people’s minds. As much progress as we’ve made, we have a long way to go.”

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a strong proponent of stricter gun control since the mass shootings at Sandy Hook, said the attack was “rooted in hate.”

“What horrifying, devastating news. This kind of violence — seemingly targeted at specific individuals and rooted in hate — has no place in our society. This is a truly sad day, and it’s sad on so many levels. Our condolences go out to all of the families and loved ones affected,” said Malloy, who directed the state to fly flags at half-staff until sunset on Thursday.

The attack came during Pride Month — the day after Boston’s Pride Parade and just hours before Los Angeles’ Pride Parade. It is also during the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims, a time of fasting and reflection.

In Hartford, Robin McHaelen of True Colors said Hartford Pride events are scheduled to continue this week as planned. She said organizers are talking with Hartford police Chief James Rovella about increasing security around the events.

Deputy Chief Brian Foley said the police are “working closely with our fed partners this morning.”

In New Haven, police Chief Dean Esserman ordered officers to focus on the city’s public gathering places – especially nightclubs, concert halls, LGBT venues, theaters and public spaces.

“We stand in solidarity with the LGBT community and our partners in policing as we denounce this deliberately perpetrated act of violence,” Esserman said.

Saud Anwar, founder of the American Muslim Peace Initiative and a councilman in South Windsor, said Connecticut must oppose “hate in any shape or any form.”

“The disease in our society is hate and intolerance and we all need to unite against that,” he said.

Shawn Lang, deputy director of AIDS Connecticut, said she felt the attack was motivated by an increase in divisive rhetoric in the nation.

“We’ve made a lot of headway in terms of movement for equality, but again if we look at the kind of rhetoric we see coming to the surface whether it’s around race or religion or so or around women’s issues we need to figure out ways to bring people together instead of driving people apart,” Lang said.

“You know, this is gay pride month so an attack on the gay community during the month of June is poignant,” Lang said. “Places like gay bars and gay bookstores have often been safe havens for our world.”

Former Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra said he and his husband have been to the Orlando club where the shootings occurred.

Segarra said it’s not just gays who feel unsafe in this environment, but all minorities. “I know good practicing Muslims are against this madness,” he said. “The reasonable side of all groups need to come together. We don’t want to accelerate and further divide our country.”

Beth Kerrigan, a West Hartford resident and town council member, who was the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that brought marriage equality to Connecticut, said attacks like those in Orlando illustrate how hate speech is becoming mainstream in America.

“I think there are leaders that encourage hatred and intolerance as a way of life. I do think that it is not helping us to be a world of love. Whether it’s religious or sexual orientation or race. I don’t think it’s the majority but there are leaders that are OK to spew hate.”

Dr. Reza Monsoor, spokesman for the Muslim Coalition of Connecticut, said they “stand in solidarity with the gay community.” “Hate crimes against the gay community need to be opposed by all communities, including Muslims.”

“We cringe when there is an act of violence by a misguided Muslim. In this present atmosphere of Islamophobia, it just plays into the stereotype that Muslims around the world are responsible for more and more attacks.”

Monsoor said the coalition “strives so hard to give our youth an American, Islamic identity, so they aren’t attracted to these hate groups.”

“Islam puts such a huge focus on the saving of life,” he said, quoting from the Quran: “If whoever takes a life, it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind.

The Rev. Cathy Rion Starr, co-pastor with her spouse, Heather Rion Starr, at the Unitarian Society of Hartford, learned of the massacre after services Sunday morning.

“It’s just heartbreaking and horrifying and shocking, but not shocking, because it keeps happening,” she said. “How do we continue to celebrate life, while also knowing we live in this broken world?”

Mike Lawlor, Malloy’s undersecretary for criminal justice policy, said the shooting in Orlando is a testament to the social and political climate in the United States.

“There are some people who apparently cannot handle the fact that in our country as every year goes by, equality spreads to almost everyone,” Lawlor said. “It is stirring up a lot of hatred apparently and it’s just that some people cannot handle change and once in a while this is how people respond.”

Lawlor said he thinks the LGBT community feels secure in Connecticut, but policies in other states do not give them the same protections and attitudes toward gay rights have been slower to change.

“My husband, son and I travel,” Lawlor said. “It’s a little different when we go to other places in the country.”",HARTFORD — Political and gay leaders from across Connecticut reacted with revulsion Sunday to the terrorist attack at a Florida nightclub that left 50 people dead and scores wounded. “I…

“It just made me sick,” said state Sen. Beth Bye of West Hartford. “Many of us have felt discrimination and had people loathe us. It is a hate crime and it is a terrorist attack. It is meant to put terror in people’s minds. As much progress as we’ve made, we have a long way to go.”

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a strong proponent of stricter gun control since the mass shootings at Sandy Hook, said the attack was “rooted in hate.”

“What horrifying, devastating news. This kind of violence — seemingly targeted at specific individuals and rooted in hate — has no place in our society. This is a truly sad day, and it’s sad on so many levels. Our condolences go out to all of the families and loved ones affected,” said Malloy, who directed the state to fly flags at half-staff until sunset on Thursday.

The attack came during Pride Month — the day after Boston’s Pride Parade and just hours before Los Angeles’ Pride Parade. It is also during the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims, a time of fasting and reflection.

In Hartford, Robin McHaelen of True Colors said Hartford Pride events are scheduled to continue this week as planned. She said organizers are talking with Hartford police Chief James Rovella about increasing security around the events.

Deputy Chief Brian Foley said the police are “working closely with our fed partners this morning.”

In New Haven, police Chief Dean Esserman ordered officers to focus on the city’s public gathering places – especially nightclubs, concert halls, LGBT venues, theaters and public spaces.

“We stand in solidarity with the LGBT community and our partners in policing as we denounce this deliberately perpetrated act of violence,” Esserman said.

Saud Anwar, founder of the American Muslim Peace Initiative and a councilman in South Windsor, said Connecticut must oppose “hate in any shape or any form.”

“The disease in our society is hate and intolerance and we all need to unite against that,” he said.

Shawn Lang, deputy director of AIDS Connecticut, said she felt the attack was motivated by an increase in divisive rhetoric in the nation.

“We’ve made a lot of headway in terms of movement for equality, but again if we look at the kind of rhetoric we see coming to the surface whether it’s around race or religion or so or around women’s issues we need to figure out ways to bring people together instead of driving people apart,” Lang said.

“You know, this is gay pride month so an attack on the gay community during the month of June is poignant,” Lang said. “Places like gay bars and gay bookstores have often been safe havens for our world.”

Former Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra said he and his husband have been to the Orlando club where the shootings occurred.

Segarra said it’s not just gays who feel unsafe in this environment, but all minorities. “I know good practicing Muslims are against this madness,” he said. “The reasonable side of all groups need to come together. We don’t want to accelerate and further divide our country.”

Beth Kerrigan, a West Hartford resident and town council member, who was the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that brought marriage equality to Connecticut, said attacks like those in Orlando illustrate how hate speech is becoming mainstream in America.

“I think there are leaders that encourage hatred and intolerance as a way of life. I do think that it is not helping us to be a world of love. Whether it’s religious or sexual orientation or race. I don’t think it’s the majority but there are leaders that are OK to spew hate.”

Dr. Reza Monsoor, spokesman for the Muslim Coalition of Connecticut, said they “stand in solidarity with the gay community.” “Hate crimes against the gay community need to be opposed by all communities, including Muslims.”

“We cringe when there is an act of violence by a misguided Muslim. In this present atmosphere of Islamophobia, it just plays into the stereotype that Muslims around the world are responsible for more and more attacks.”

Monsoor said the coalition “strives so hard to give our youth an American, Islamic identity, so they aren’t attracted to these hate groups.”

“Islam puts such a huge focus on the saving of life,” he said, quoting from the Quran: “If whoever takes a life, it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind.

The Rev. Cathy Rion Starr, co-pastor with her spouse, Heather Rion Starr, at the Unitarian Society of Hartford, learned of the massacre after services Sunday morning.

“It’s just heartbreaking and horrifying and shocking, but not shocking, because it keeps happening,” she said. “How do we continue to celebrate life, while also knowing we live in this broken world?”

Mike Lawlor, Malloy’s undersecretary for criminal justice policy, said the shooting in Orlando is a testament to the social and political climate in the United States.

“There are some people who apparently cannot handle the fact that in our country as every year goes by, equality spreads to almost everyone,” Lawlor said. “It is stirring up a lot of hatred apparently and it’s just that some people cannot handle change and once in a while this is how people respond.”

Lawlor said he thinks the LGBT community feels secure in Connecticut, but policies in other states do not give them the same protections and attitudes toward gay rights have been slower to change.

“My husband, son and I travel,” Lawlor said. “It’s a little different when we go to other places in the country.”",HARTFORD — Political and gay leaders from across Connecticut reacted with revulsion Sunday to the terrorist attack at a Florida nightclub that left 50 people dead and scores wounded. “I…

The man in question told the law enforcement officers that he was in the town for the L.A. Pride festival in West Hollywood, reported L.A.Times.

The patrolling officers questioned an individual based on a distrust call near Olympic Boulevard and 11th Street. During the inspection, the officials found â€œseveral weapons and a lot of ammunition as well as tannerite, an ingredient that could be used to create a pipe bomb,â€ said the report.

The officials were not able to draw any connection between his arrest and mass shooting at a gay bar in Orlando in Florida on Sunday.

A gunman, identified as Umar Mateen, stormed a gay bar and opened fire indiscriminately killing at least 50 and wounding more than 50 others. He was a US citizen of Afghan descent.

The case is now being probed by the FBI, which is also exploring the terror angle in the worst mass shooting in American history.

In the meantime, the gunman's father told the media that his son's hatred against LGBT community was the main motive behind the shooting. He had also apologised to the victims.","A man was arrested on Sunday in Santa Monica, who was allegedly carrying explosives, assault rifles and ammunition in his car. "

I told this story to disabuse all New Orleanians of the notion that silence and accommodation, in the face of institutional and official failures, are a path to healing.

The story I related to them began on a typical Sunday night at a second-story bar on the fringe of New Orleans’ French Quarter in 1973, where working-class men would gather around a white baby grand piano and belt out the lyrics to a song that was the anthem of their hidden community, “United We Stand” by the Brotherhood of Man.

“United we stand,” the men would sing together, “divided we fall” — the words epitomizing the ethos of their beloved UpStairs Lounge bar, an egalitarian free space that served as a forerunner to today’s queer safe havens.

Around that piano in the 1970s Deep South, gays and lesbians, white and Black queens, Christians and non-Christians, and even early gender minorities could cast aside the racism, sexism, and homophobia of the times to find acceptance and companionship for a moment.

For regulars, the UpStairs Lounge was a miracle, a small pocket of acceptance in a broader world where their very identities were illegal.

On the Sunday night of June 24, 1973, their voices were silenced in a murderous act of arson that claimed 32 lives and still stands as the deadliest fire in New Orleans history — and the worst mass killing of gays in 20th century America.

As 13 fire companies struggled to douse the inferno, police refused to question the chief suspect, even though gay witnesses identified and brought the soot-covered man to officers idly standing by. This suspect, an internally conflicted gay-for-pay sex worker named Rodger Dale Nunez, had been ejected from the UpStairs Lounge screaming the word “burn” minutes before, but New Orleans police rebuffed the testimony of fire survivors on the street and allowed Nunez to disappear.

As the fire raged, police denigrated the deceased to reporters on the street: “Some thieves hung out there, and you know this was a queer bar.”

For days afterward, the carnage met with official silence. With no local gay political leaders willing to step forward, national Gay Liberation-era figures like Rev. Troy Perry of the Metropolitan Community Church flew in to “help our bereaved brothers and sisters” — and shatter officialdom’s code of silence.

Perry broke local taboos by holding a press conference as an openly gay man. “It’s high time that you people, in New Orleans, Louisiana, got the message and joined the rest of the Union,” Perry said.

Two days later, on June 26, 1973, as families hesitated to step forward to identify their kin in the morgue, UpStairs Lounge owner Phil Esteve stood in his badly charred bar, the air still foul with death. He rebuffed attempts by Perry to turn the fire into a call for visibility and progress for homosexuals.

“This fire had very little to do with the gay movement or with anything gay,” Esteve told a reporter from The Philadelphia Inquirer. “I do not want my bar or this tragedy to be used to further any of their causes.”

Conspicuously, no photos of Esteve appeared in coverage of the UpStairs Lounge fire or its aftermath — and the bar owner also remained silent as he witnessed police looting the ashes of his business.

“Phil said the cash register, juke box, cigarette machine and some wallets had money removed,” recounted Esteve’s friend Bob McAnear, a former U.S. Customs officer. “Phil wouldn’t report it because, if he did, police would never allow him to operate a bar in New Orleans again.”

The next day, gay bar owners, incensed at declining gay bar traffic amid an atmosphere of anxiety, confronted Perry at a clandestine meeting. “How dare you hold your damn news conferences!” one business owner shouted.

Ignoring calls for gay self-censorship, Perry held a 250-person memorial for the fire victims the following Sunday, July 1, culminating in mourners defiantly marching out the front door of a French Quarter church into waiting news cameras. “Reverend Troy Perry awoke several sleeping giants, me being one of them,” recalled Charlene Schneider, a lesbian activist who walked out of that front door with Perry.

Esteve doubted the UpStairs Lounge story’s capacity to rouse gay political fervor. As the coroner buried four of his former patrons anonymously on the edge of town, Esteve quietly collected at least $25,000 in fire insurance proceeds. Less than a year later, he used the money to open another gay bar called the Post Office, where patrons of the UpStairs Lounge — some with visible burn scars — gathered but were discouraged from singing “United We Stand.”

New Orleans cops neglected to question the chief arson suspect and closed the investigation without answers in late August 1973. Gay elites in the city’s power structure began gaslighting the mourners who marched with Perry into the news cameras, casting suspicion on their memories and re-characterizing their moment of liberation as a stunt.

When a local gay journalist asked in April 1977, “Where are the gay activists in New Orleans?,” Esteve responded that there were none, because none were needed. “We don’t feel we’re discriminated against,” Esteve said. “New Orleans gays are different from gays anywhere else… Perhaps there is some correlation between the amount of gay activism in other cities and the degree of police harassment.”

An attitude of nihilism and disavowal descended upon the memory of the UpStairs Lounge victims, goaded by Esteve and fellow gay entrepreneurs who earned their keep via gay patrons drowning their sorrows each night instead of protesting the injustices that kept them drinking.

Into the 1980s, the story of the UpStairs Lounge all but vanished from conversation — with the exception of a few sanctuaries for gay political debate such as the local lesbian bar Charlene’s, run by the activist Charlene Schneider.

By 1988, the 15th anniversary of the fire, the UpStairs Lounge narrative comprised little more than a call for better fire codes and indoor sprinklers. UpStairs Lounge survivor Stewart Butler summed it up: “A tragedy that, as far as I know, no good came of.”

Finally, in 1991, at Stewart Butler and Charlene Schneider’s nudging, the UpStairs Lounge story became aligned with the crusade of liberated gays and lesbians seeking equal rights in Louisiana. The halls of power responded with intermittent progress. The New Orleans City Council, horrified by the story but not yet ready to take its look in the mirror, enacted an anti-discrimination ordinance protecting gays and lesbians in housing, employment, and public accommodations that Dec. 12 — more than 18 years after the fire.

“I believe the fire was the catalyst for the anger to bring us all to the table,” Schneider told The Times-Picayune, a tacit rebuke to Esteve’s strategy of silent accommodation. Even Esteve seemed to change his stance with time, granting a full interview with the first UpStairs Lounge scholar Johnny Townsend sometime around 1989.

Most of the figures in this historic tale are now deceased. What’s left is an enduring story that refused to go gently. The story now echoes around the world — a musical about the UpStairs Lounge fire recently played in Tokyo, translating the gay underworld of the 1973 French Quarter for Japanese audiences.

When I finished my presentation to the City Council last June, I looked up to see the seven council members in tears. Unanimously, they approved a resolution acknowledging the historic failures of city leaders in the wake of the UpStairs Lounge fire.

Council members personally apologized to UpStairs Lounge families and survivors seated in the chamber in a symbolic act that, though it could not bring back those who died, still mattered greatly to those whose pain had been denied, leaving them to grieve alone. At long last, official silence and indifference gave way to heartfelt words of healing.

The way Americans remember the past is an active, ongoing process. Our collective memory is malleable, but it matters because it speaks volumes about our maturity as a people, how we acknowledge the past’s influence in our lives, and how it shapes the examples we set for our youth. Do we grapple with difficult truths, or do we duck accountability by defaulting to nostalgia and bluster? Or worse, do we simply ignore the past until it fades into a black hole of ignorance and indifference?

I believe that a factual retelling of the UpStairs Lounge tragedy — and how, 50 years onward, it became known internationally — resonates beyond our current divides. It reminds queer and non-queer Americans that ignoring the past holds back the present, and that silence is no cure for what ails a participatory nation.

Silence isolates. Silence gaslights and shrouds. It preserves the power structures that scapegoat the disempowered.

Solidarity, on the other hand, unites. Solidarity illuminates a path forward together. Above all, solidarity transforms the downtrodden into a resounding chorus of citizens — in the spirit of voices who once gathered ‘round a white baby grand piano and sang, joyfully and loudly, “United We Stand.”

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

WASHINGTON — Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said attackers like the shooter in the Orlando massacre are “the new face of the war on terror.”

“They have said openly that they intend to target us here, and one of the hardest parts of this war is the individual who carries out an attack by themselves in a soft target like this, basically, in Orlando, Florida,” Rubio said in a phone interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday.

“And it’s a reminder that the war on terror has evolved into something we’ve never had to confront before — individuals capable of conducting these sorts of massacres unexpectedly in places that you normally wouldn’t associate with the kinds of attacks that you see,” he said.

At least 50 people were killed and 53 injured in the early Sunday morning hours at a LGBT nightclub in Orlando, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

“If in fact this terrorist attack is one inspired by radical Islamic ideology, it is quite frankly not surprising that they would target this community in this horrifying way, and I think it’s something we’ll have to talk about some more here, across the country,” he said.

Rubio said it’s not yet clear what the shooter’s motivations were, but that if radical Islamic beliefs were behind the shooting, “common sense tells you he specifically targeted the gay community because of the views that exist in the radical Islamic community with regard to the gay community.”

“You can just imagine the demand on the blood bank,” he said. “So I would encourage those that are eligible and can give blood to please try to do that. That’s one thing we can do.”

Mir Seddique is the father of Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida. Seddique told NBC News that his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thinks that may be related to the shooting.

Seddique says: ""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. ... We are in shock like the whole country.""

The father also says the incident has nothing to do with religion.

The shooter, who was identified as Omar S. Mateen, was among the 50 killed, and that they're investigating whether the incident was an act of terrorism, officials said.

President Barack Obama says the nightclub shooting in Orlando was an ""act of terror"" and an ""act of hate.""

He was reportedly briefed by Lisa Monaco, the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, on the shooting, which resulted in at least 50 deaths and more than 50 injured.

According to the statement, Obama's asked for regular updates as federal and local officials gather more information.

In the time since the shooting ended, the gunman was killed and identified, and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a state of emergency.

Obama started speaking about the shooting at around 2:00 pm Sunday, and his weakened resolve about gun vilence was palpable.

Though Obama's made gun control important to his administration, he's never been able to get common sense gun regulations passed. Gun control was the cornerstone of a speech where Obama became emotional over the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and it running in the undercurrent of his speech today.

According to a statement in the press conference, this would be the 15th time Obama spoke about a mass shooting.

In his remarks, Obama said,

The president also ordered all US government flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims.

The vice president was also briefed on the situation and offered his prayers and condolences.

Presidential candidates and politicians also weighed in on the tragedy.

In a statement, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting occurred, called the Orlando shooting part of an ""epidemic"" that ""will continue without end if Congress continues to sit on its hands and do nothing, again.”

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,""

Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, tweeted a statement about the shooting.

Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also tweeted about the shooting.

As many have noted here and on social media, the shooting's timing is ironic given that Obama just declared June to be lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride month. Surely the irony wasn't lost on Obama who only just spoke about gay pride and LGBT equality and activism on Saturday.

As The White House said, ""When all Americans are treated equal, we are all more free."" Now, if only we could listen to Obama on common sense gun control, then maybe we wouldn't have to deal with a new mass shooting every day. Who knows when the next deadliest shooting in US history will occur if we all don't do something about it.

Breaking news from Orlando, Fla. via CNN, about the FBI issuing bulletins to gay clubs as a precaution. The FBI has listed the massacre as both a hate crime and an act of terrorism.

The press conference also shed some light about Noor Salman, the killer’s wife, making it official that she knew of the “killer’s thirst for attack,” but they don’t think Salman was a co-conspirator. In addition, they reported that the gunman had befriended transgender women on gay sites and visited online gay chat rooms.

According to a CNN interview with Salman, the widowers said “she is not sure if Omar Saddiqui Mateen, her ex-husband and father of her son, was gay or not. She added, in the interview with CNN’s Don Lemon, that being “homosexual” brings shame to their families. She also, said that Mateen’s father was not tolerant of the “homosexual way of life,” and added that neither is she.

Authorities find that Salman may be a person of interest and are trying to find out if she is a co-conspirator in the attack that killed 49 innocent people and injured 53 others in the morning of June 12. Main media networks have questioned about her possible involvement or knowledge she may have had about the shooting. Salman was born in California. Her parents are Palestinian.

Update: President Obama spoke to the nation, after getting briefed by the FBI and Homeland Security today, called the Orlando shooting “homegrown extremism,” something that has worried the administration for some time. While at the last minute the shooter expressed allegiance to Isil, he did not appear to be part of a broader Isil plot, said the President.

He said organizations like IS, al-Qaida and others target gays and lesbians because of their ‘‘vicious, bankrupt ideology’’ and their religious beliefs about homosexuality.

‘‘The fact that it took place at a club frequented by the LGBT community I think is also relevant,’’ Obama said.

He noted that the attack underscored the “risks we were taking by being so lax on firearms.” The President also said these sort of events tended to devolve into an “either-or” debate over gun control versus terrorism. He said they were still looking at “all the possible motivations of the killer.”

Update: A Torrington, Conn. native with ties in Massachusetts for over a decade, was working for Pulse at the time of the shooting. KJ Morris, 37, has been confirmed as one of the victims of the massacre at the night club. Morris was a bouncer at Pulse and had moved to Fla. only two months ago, according to her FB page. She was a well known drag king in western New England, often performing at various area clubs under the stage name “Daddy K.”

A Springfield, Mass. resident, Stanley Manolo Almodovar III, 23, was also another victim. Born and raised in Springfield, Almodovar moved to Clermont, Fla. in 2004, according to CBS Boston.

Update: President orders the American flag to be flown at half staff everywhere in the U.S. and abroad in U.S Offices. President Obama’s addressed the most deadly mass shooting in the U.S. history via the following statement.

THE PRESIDENT: Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder—a horrific massacre—of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city. Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.

I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisors. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I’ve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation.

We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We’ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what—if any—inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us.

This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need—they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come.

We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm’s way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It’s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough.

So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American—regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation—is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.

Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.

In the coming hours and days, we’ll learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families—that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more—as a country—by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us.

As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts—friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.

May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love. Thank you.

Update: A suspect with arsenal arrested at L.A. Gay Pride, the city of West Hollywood is in heightened alert.

Although many cities have been celebrating LGBT Pride in June throughout the country, one city in the country is mourning. A Gay Club in Orlando, Florida was the site of what many are considering the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the nation and the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, according to CNN.

Pulse, one of the biggest nightclubs in Orlando, Florida, was holding, according to BBC News, a Latin-themed event that was nearing its end when a man opened fire inside. Shortly afterwards, the nightclub posted on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.”

Mayor Buddy Dyer said to USA Today that 53 wounded in the attack at Pulse, 1912 S Orange Ave., a gay club just south of downtown. Other news sources are reporting 50 people were killed.

NBC News reported that Mina Justice was outside the club trying to contact her 30-year-old son Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: “He’s coming.”

“The next text said: ‘He has us, and he’s in here with us,'” she told The Associated Press. “That was the last conversation.”

According to CNN, the shooter has been identified as Omar Saddiqui Mateen, of Port St. Lucie Fla. who had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Pro ISIS/islamic forums are responding with excitement to the shooting, although no group has claimed responsibility for the massacre yet.

USA Today reported that Police Chief John Mina said the tragedy “began at 2:02 a.m., when three police officers engaged the suspect in a gun battle outside the club. A hostage situation then took place inside, and a SWAT team was called in, Mina said. Police received updates from patrons trapped in the club, and decided to storm the club at about 5 a.m.”

“Our biggest concern was further loss of life,” Mina said. “We exchanged gunfire with the suspect, and he was dead at the scene.”

Florida Governor, Rick Scott, has declared a state of emergency following the massacre. Scott told CNN that this was “clearly an act of terrorism,” adding too that it “should make every American angry.”

Steve Boswell, President and CEO of Fenway Health, released the following statement:

“Our hearts are with our grieving community in Orlando and with our larger community where people are hurting today. This atrocious act of terror and hate is beyond comprehension. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and loved ones and the many lives they touched.

“As the nation continues to grapple with gun violence and important questions related to community safety in the aftermath of this and the far too many events like it, we urge our political leaders, policy makers, the media, and citizen activists to take action to ensure public safety. We must demand the right to live in a safe and peaceful society.

“In Orlando, patrons at an LGBT bar were targeted. Coming during LGBT Pride Month, a time when we come together to celebrate our lives and each other, this attack is an assault on the entire LGBT community.

“We’ll learn more as events unfold in the coming days, but let’s focus on staying strong, staying proud and staying united against hate and intolerance. When we stand together, we are strong and we are beautiful.”

“All of us at MassEquality are shocked and deeply saddened by the news from Orlando, FL this morning. Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, the Orlando LGBTQ and Latin@ communities, and all who have been touched by this terrible event.

“We are horrified that the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history took place in a gay nightclub during Pride month–a time when the LGBTQ community and its allies join together to celebrate our history and look ahead to a future when we hope everyone can live free from discrimination and violence. The fact that those who were killed and wounded were at the club on Latin night painfully highlights the racist violence faced by so many members of our community.

MassEquality is the leading statewide grassroots advocacy organization working to ensure that everyone across Massachusetts can thrive from cradle to grave without discrimination and oppression based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

“From the entire Fenway Health family: Our hearts are with our grieving community in Orlando, and with our community everywhere where people are hurting today,” read a statement released by Fenway Health. “In the face of hate and intolerance, let’s all remember that we are strong together, and we are beautiful.”

“Words do not express the shock and sadness I feel,” said Elias Vivas, Interim Director, Hispanic Black Gay Coalition, HBGC. “The state of LGBTQ rights greatly depends on the continued work to undo homophobia, transphobia, islamophobia and racism that will surface as a result of this tragedy. These horrific events should not be the only way we are motived to make change — we have a lot of work to do to support our LGBTQ communities. My condolences go out to those families grieving this Sunday.”

Rhode Island Pride and the RI LGBTQ Center stand together in solidarity with those touched by the recent mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse LGBT club.

Our hearts are with our Florida brothers and sisters, their families and all those affected by this senseless act. We lament the agonizing loss of life, and we are renewed in our commitment to create a safer world.

The vibrant light of our LGBTQ community will not be extinguished by violence or terror.

Michael Adams, SAGE CEO and Dr. Yanira Cruz, NHCOA President & CEO released the following joint statement:

“Many constituents of SAGE (Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders) are Latino and many constituents of NHCOA (National Hispanic Council on Aging) are LGBT.

“Words cannot express our grief at the senseless loss of so many – including many LGBT Latino people, in the heinous massacre at Pulse in Orlando.

“The tragedy last night at Pulse, reminds us that we cannot be divided into disconnected communities and that our lives, our cultures, our identities and our goals intersect in ways large and small.

“Knowing this, we condemn not only the violence in Orlando, but also any effort to hijack this tragedy to advance an agenda of bigotry and hatred against immigrants, Muslims or any other community.

“We will not allow the lost lives of our LGBT and Latino brothers and sisters to be devalued in this way. Our diversity is a source of strength, and must not be used to create division. Thus, we will stand strong for justice and equity for every member of every community in this extraordinarily diverse country.”

SAGE (Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders) is the country’s largest and oldest organization dedicated to improving the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) older adults. Founded in 1978 and headquartered in New York City, SAGE is a national organization that offers supportive services and consumer resources to LGBT older adults and their caregivers, advocates for public policy changes that address the needs of LGBT older people, and provides training for aging providers and LGBT organizations through its National Resource Center on LGBT Aging.

Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-04) released the following statement: “My heart aches over the tragic events that took place last night in Orlando, Florida. As details about this horrific incident emerge—including the background of the perpetrator—make no mistake, this was indeed an act of terror. This savage act was carried out in an effort to intimidate and terrify our LGBT brothers and sisters.

“This senseless loss of life transpired in a club that was meant to be a safe space for an already vulnerable group of Americans, but we must never forget that an attack on the LGBT community is an attack on all of us. As we mourn for those whose lives have been touched by this act of barbarism, we must do everything in our collective power to put an end to the attitudes and behaviors that help cultivate a society where such hate can come to fruition. Today, Milwaukee stands with the City of Orlando and our nation’s LGBT community.”

Stuart Milk, nephew of Harvey Milk and co-founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation, released the following statement in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida:

“Last night, the worst domestic terror attack since 911 has tragically hit American LGBT families head on—know the latest victims of hatred—mostly young men and women who were simply out for a night of dancing and enjoyment of our community during LGBT Pride month. These victims of a hate crime targeting an LGBT club had their futures stolen, had their dreams stolen, their potential contributions stolen from us all.

The LGBT Orlando community and our allies in Central Florida are both strong and unified. We send a world of love and prayers to all who are grieving today and to all who will begin the hard journey to recover from untold wounds, both physical and emotional. But our love and prayers are simply not enough. Hate and separation continue to bring forth too much grief, too many stolen lives across the whole world.

As we reach out to comfort the Orlando families, and as we support the courage for the injured to heal, may we also have the strength to address and deal with the roots of hatred and separation that target any minority community with violence, anywhere in the world. May we find a way forward to make this act of horrendous violence a commitment to come together and so honor the memories of those who were killed today.”

*The Chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), a coalition of 40 of the nation’s preeminent Latino advocacy organizations, issued the following statement in response to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse nightclub, and expressing solidarity with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community.

“We stand in solidarity with our LGBTQ brothers and sisters who were targeted in this heinous attack in Orlando, in which initial reports suggest that the brunt of the suffering fell upon LGBTQ Latinos. We share our deepest condolences and sympathy with the families and loved ones of those who were killed. This was an attack on all of us,” said Hector Sanchez, NHLA Chair and Executive Director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement. “We hope that those who were injured are able to make a full recovery and encourage all those who are able, to donate blood as soon as possible at the nearest blood donation center to help the survivors.”

Equality Federation released the following statement: “Our hearts are heavy at this time and we extend our love and condolences to the friends and family of those affected by the horrific tragedy in Orlando.

Pulse nightclub was founded in part to honor a man who had died of AIDS and to promote awareness of the local LGBTQ community. Nightlife venues have historically been places of refuge for LGBTQ people and continue to serve an important role, keeping our community vibrant and connected.

This outrageous, senseless act of terror comes during Pride month when LGBTQ people around the world are celebrating the progress we’ve made towards achieving peace and equality for all. It impacts all of us. We need everyone to be united in the struggle against violence and discrimination.”

“Our hearts are with the LGBTQ and entire Orlando community. Any violence is unacceptable in our society. And while our community has made historic strides in acceptance and equality, this tragedy is a painful reminder of the dangers LGBTQ people continue to face every day.”

The Center is co-sponsoring a vigil tonight at 8 p.m. at Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco. We will mourn, honor, and remember the victims and recommit to peace and our continuing purse of full LGBTQ equality.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is outraged at the attack on the Pulse Club in Orlando, Florida, which specifically targeted the LGBT community. The Museum expressed its condolences to the many families and friends who lost loved ones in this depraved act.

The perpetrator had reportedly expressed allegiance to ISIS reminding us of the continuing dangers extremist ideologies pose. Regardless of whether this was a hate crime or an act of terrorism, the intent was to murder members of the LGBT community. During the Nazi era, the Germans dramatically intensified their persecution of homosexuals who were deemed unfit for the “Aryan community.” Some 50,000 were sent to prison and between 5,000 and 15,000 were incarcerated in concentration camps where many perished.

A living memorial to the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum inspires citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity. Its far-reaching educational programs and global impact are made possible by generous donors. For more information, visit www.ushmm.org.

Florida State Senator, Geraldine Thompson, spoke to CNN regarding “getting serious about gun reform,” a statement made by Sen. Thompson since she represents the district where the night club resides. “Every time we talk about mass shootings we talk reform, but nothing is done.”

The shooter was a U.S. citizen born in New York in 1986. He had active security officer and fire arm silences, according to Florida records, reported NBC News.

Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla. whose district also include the area of the shooting said, “It’s no coincidence that the attack took place when it did and where it did. It might be that we’ve seen the commission of an awful hate crime. This comes on the cusp of celebrating Gay Pride.

President Obama’s address to the nation happened about the hate crime took place close to 2 p.m. EST on June 12.

A Springfield, Mass. resident, Stanley Manolo Almodovar III, 23, was also another victim. Born and raised in Springfield, Almodovar moved to Clermont, Fla. in 2004, according to CBS Boston.

Update: President orders the American flag to be flown at half staff everywhere in the U.S. and abroad in U.S Offices. President Obama’s addressed the most deadly mass shooting in the U.S. history via the following statement.

THE PRESIDENT: Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder—a horrific massacre—of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city. Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.

I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisors. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I’ve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation.

We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We’ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what—if any—inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us.

This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need—they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come.

We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm’s way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It’s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough.

So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American—regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation—is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.

Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.

In the coming hours and days, we’ll learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families—that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more—as a country—by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us.

As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts—friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.

May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love. Thank you.

Update: A suspect with arsenal arrested at L.A. Gay Pride, the city of West Hollywood is in heightened alert.

Although many cities have been celebrating LGBT Pride in June throughout the country, one city in the country is mourning. A Gay Club in Orlando, Florida was the site of what many are considering the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the nation and the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, according to CNN.

Pulse, one of the biggest nightclubs in Orlando, Florida, was holding, according to BBC News, a Latin-themed event that was nearing its end when a man opened fire inside. Shortly afterwards, the nightclub posted on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.”

Mayor Buddy Dyer said to USA Today that 53 wounded in the attack at Pulse, 1912 S Orange Ave., a gay club just south of downtown. Other news sources are reporting 50 people were killed.

NBC News reported that Mina Justice was outside the club trying to contact her 30-year-old son Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: “He’s coming.”

“The next text said: ‘He has us, and he’s in here with us,'” she told The Associated Press. “That was the last conversation.”

According to CNN, the shooter has been identified as Omar Saddiqui Mateen, of Port St. Lucie Fla. who had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Pro ISIS/islamic forums are responding with excitement to the shooting, although no group has claimed responsibility for the massacre yet.

USA Today reported that Police Chief John Mina said the tragedy “began at 2:02 a.m., when three police officers engaged the suspect in a gun battle outside the club. A hostage situation then took place inside, and a SWAT team was called in, Mina said. Police received updates from patrons trapped in the club, and decided to storm the club at about 5 a.m.”

“Our biggest concern was further loss of life,” Mina said. “We exchanged gunfire with the suspect, and he was dead at the scene.”

Florida Governor, Rick Scott, has declared a state of emergency following the massacre. Scott told CNN that this was “clearly an act of terrorism,” adding too that it “should make every American angry.”

Steve Boswell, President and CEO of Fenway Health, released the following statement:

“Our hearts are with our grieving community in Orlando and with our larger community where people are hurting today. This atrocious act of terror and hate is beyond comprehension. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and loved ones and the many lives they touched.

“As the nation continues to grapple with gun violence and important questions related to community safety in the aftermath of this and the far too many events like it, we urge our political leaders, policy makers, the media, and citizen activists to take action to ensure public safety. We must demand the right to live in a safe and peaceful society.

“In Orlando, patrons at an LGBT bar were targeted. Coming during LGBT Pride Month, a time when we come together to celebrate our lives and each other, this attack is an assault on the entire LGBT community.

“We’ll learn more as events unfold in the coming days, but let’s focus on staying strong, staying proud and staying united against hate and intolerance. When we stand together, we are strong and we are beautiful.”

“All of us at MassEquality are shocked and deeply saddened by the news from Orlando, FL this morning. Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, the Orlando LGBTQ and Latin@ communities, and all who have been touched by this terrible event.

“We are horrified that the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history took place in a gay nightclub during Pride month–a time when the LGBTQ community and its allies join together to celebrate our history and look ahead to a future when we hope everyone can live free from discrimination and violence. The fact that those who were killed and wounded were at the club on Latin night painfully highlights the racist violence faced by so many members of our community.

MassEquality is the leading statewide grassroots advocacy organization working to ensure that everyone across Massachusetts can thrive from cradle to grave without discrimination and oppression based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

“From the entire Fenway Health family: Our hearts are with our grieving community in Orlando, and with our community everywhere where people are hurting today,” read a statement released by Fenway Health. “In the face of hate and intolerance, let’s all remember that we are strong together, and we are beautiful.”

“Words do not express the shock and sadness I feel,” said Elias Vivas, Interim Director, Hispanic Black Gay Coalition, HBGC. “The state of LGBTQ rights greatly depends on the continued work to undo homophobia, transphobia, islamophobia and racism that will surface as a result of this tragedy. These horrific events should not be the only way we are motived to make change — we have a lot of work to do to support our LGBTQ communities. My condolences go out to those families grieving this Sunday.”

Rhode Island Pride and the RI LGBTQ Center stand together in solidarity with those touched by the recent mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse LGBT club.

Our hearts are with our Florida brothers and sisters, their families and all those affected by this senseless act. We lament the agonizing loss of life, and we are renewed in our commitment to create a safer world.

The vibrant light of our LGBTQ community will not be extinguished by violence or terror.

Michael Adams, SAGE CEO and Dr. Yanira Cruz, NHCOA President & CEO released the following joint statement:

“Many constituents of SAGE (Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders) are Latino and many constituents of NHCOA (National Hispanic Council on Aging) are LGBT.

“Words cannot express our grief at the senseless loss of so many – including many LGBT Latino people, in the heinous massacre at Pulse in Orlando.

“The tragedy last night at Pulse, reminds us that we cannot be divided into disconnected communities and that our lives, our cultures, our identities and our goals intersect in ways large and small.

“Knowing this, we condemn not only the violence in Orlando, but also any effort to hijack this tragedy to advance an agenda of bigotry and hatred against immigrants, Muslims or any other community.

“We will not allow the lost lives of our LGBT and Latino brothers and sisters to be devalued in this way. Our diversity is a source of strength, and must not be used to create division. Thus, we will stand strong for justice and equity for every member of every community in this extraordinarily diverse country.”

Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-04) released the following statement: “My heart aches over the tragic events that took place last night in Orlando, Florida. As details about this horrific incident emerge—including the background of the perpetrator—make no mistake, this was indeed an act of terror. This savage act was carried out in an effort to intimidate and terrify our LGBT brothers and sisters.

“This senseless loss of life transpired in a club that was meant to be a safe space for an already vulnerable group of Americans, but we must never forget that an attack on the LGBT community is an attack on all of us. As we mourn for those whose lives have been touched by this act of barbarism, we must do everything in our collective power to put an end to the attitudes and behaviors that help cultivate a society where such hate can come to fruition. Today, Milwaukee stands with the City of Orlando and our nation’s LGBT community.”

Stuart Milk, nephew of Harvey Milk and co-founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation, released the following statement in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida:

“Last night, the worst domestic terror attack since 911 has tragically hit American LGBT families head on—know the latest victims of hatred—mostly young men and women who were simply out for a night of dancing and enjoyment of our community during LGBT Pride month. These victims of a hate crime targeting an LGBT club had their futures stolen, had their dreams stolen, their potential contributions stolen from us all.

The LGBT Orlando community and our allies in Central Florida are both strong and unified. We send a world of love and prayers to all who are grieving today and to all who will begin the hard journey to recover from untold wounds, both physical and emotional. But our love and prayers are simply not enough. Hate and separation continue to bring forth too much grief, too many stolen lives across the whole world.

As we reach out to comfort the Orlando families, and as we support the courage for the injured to heal, may we also have the strength to address and deal with the roots of hatred and separation that target any minority community with violence, anywhere in the world. May we find a way forward to make this act of horrendous violence a commitment to come together and so honor the memories of those who were killed today.”

*The Chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), a coalition of 40 of the nation’s preeminent Latino advocacy organizations, issued the following statement in response to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse nightclub, and expressing solidarity with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community.

“We stand in solidarity with our LGBTQ brothers and sisters who were targeted in this heinous attack in Orlando, in which initial reports suggest that the brunt of the suffering fell upon LGBTQ Latinos. We share our deepest condolences and sympathy with the families and loved ones of those who were killed. This was an attack on all of us,” said Hector Sanchez, NHLA Chair and Executive Director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement. “We hope that those who were injured are able to make a full recovery and encourage all those who are able, to donate blood as soon as possible at the nearest blood donation center to help the survivors.”

Equality Federation released the following statement: “Our hearts are heavy at this time and we extend our love and condolences to the friends and family of those affected by the horrific tragedy in Orlando.

Pulse nightclub was founded in part to honor a man who had died of AIDS and to promote awareness of the local LGBTQ community. Nightlife venues have historically been places of refuge for LGBTQ people and continue to serve an important role, keeping our community vibrant and connected.

This outrageous, senseless act of terror comes during Pride month when LGBTQ people around the world are celebrating the progress we’ve made towards achieving peace and equality for all. It impacts all of us. We need everyone to be united in the struggle against violence and discrimination.”

“Our hearts are with the LGBTQ and entire Orlando community. Any violence is unacceptable in our society. And while our community has made historic strides in acceptance and equality, this tragedy is a painful reminder of the dangers LGBTQ people continue to face every day.”

The Center is co-sponsoring a vigil tonight at 8 p.m. at Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco. We will mourn, honor, and remember the victims and recommit to peace and our continuing purse of full LGBTQ equality.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is outraged at the attack on the Pulse Club in Orlando, Florida, which specifically targeted the LGBT community. The Museum expressed its condolences to the many families and friends who lost loved ones in this depraved act.

The perpetrator had reportedly expressed allegiance to ISIS reminding us of the continuing dangers extremist ideologies pose. Regardless of whether this was a hate crime or an act of terrorism, the intent was to murder members of the LGBT community. During the Nazi era, the Germans dramatically intensified their persecution of homosexuals who were deemed unfit for the “Aryan community.” Some 50,000 were sent to prison and between 5,000 and 15,000 were incarcerated in concentration camps where many perished.

A living memorial to the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum inspires citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity. Its far-reaching educational programs and global impact are made possible by generous donors. For more information, visit www.ushmm.org.

Florida State Senator, Geraldine Thompson, spoke to CNN regarding “getting serious about gun reform,” a statement made by Sen. Thompson since she represents the district where the night club resides. “Every time we talk about mass shootings we talk reform, but nothing is done.”

The shooter was a U.S. citizen born in New York in 1986. He had active security officer and fire arm silences, according to Florida records, reported NBC News.

Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla. whose district also include the area of the shooting said, “It’s no coincidence that the attack took place when it did and where it did. It might be that we’ve seen the commission of an awful hate crime. This comes on the cusp of celebrating Gay Pride.

President Obama’s address to the nation happened about the hate crime took place close to 2 p.m. EST on June 12.

Breaking news from Orlando, Fla. via CNN, about the FBI issuing bulletins to gay clubs as a precaution. The FBI has listed the massacre as both a hate crime and an act of terrorism.

The press conference also shed some light about Noor Salman, the killer’s wife, making it official that she knew of the “killer’s thirst for attack,” but they don’t think Salman was a co-conspirator. In addition, they reported that the gunman had befriended transgender women on gay sites and visited online gay chat rooms.

According to a CNN interview with Salman, the widowers said “she is not sure if Omar Saddiqui Mateen, her ex-husband and father of her son, was gay or not. She added, in the interview with CNN’s Don Lemon, that being “homosexual” brings shame to their families. She also, said that Mateen’s father was not tolerant of the “homosexual way of life,” and added that neither is she.

Authorities find that Salman may be a person of interest and are trying to find out if she is a co-conspirator in the attack that killed 49 innocent people and injured 53 others in the morning of June 12. Main media networks have questioned about her possible involvement or knowledge she may have had about the shooting. Salman was born in California. Her parents are Palestinian.

Update: President Obama spoke to the nation, after getting briefed by the FBI and Homeland Security today, called the Orlando shooting “homegrown extremism,” something that has worried the administration for some time. While at the last minute the shooter expressed allegiance to Isil, he did not appear to be part of a broader Isil plot, said the President.

He said organizations like IS, al-Qaida and others target gays and lesbians because of their ‘‘vicious, bankrupt ideology’’ and their religious beliefs about homosexuality.

‘‘The fact that it took place at a club frequented by the LGBT community I think is also relevant,’’ Obama said.

He noted that the attack underscored the “risks we were taking by being so lax on firearms.” The President also said these sort of events tended to devolve into an “either-or” debate over gun control versus terrorism. He said they were still looking at “all the possible motivations of the killer.”

Update: A Torrington, Conn. native with ties in Massachusetts for over a decade, was working for Pulse at the time of the shooting. KJ Morris, 37, has been confirmed as one of the victims of the massacre at the night club. Morris was a bouncer at Pulse and had moved to Fla. only two months ago, according to her FB page. She was a well known drag king in western New England, often performing at various area clubs under the stage name “Daddy K.”

A Springfield, Mass. resident, Stanley Manolo Almodovar III, 23, was also another victim. Born and raised in Springfield, Almodovar moved to Clermont, Fla. in 2004, according to CBS Boston.

Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-04) released the following statement: “My heart aches over the tragic events that took place last night in Orlando, Florida. As details about this horrific incident emerge—including the background of the perpetrator—make no mistake, this was indeed an act of terror. This savage act was carried out in an effort to intimidate and terrify our LGBT brothers and sisters.

“This senseless loss of life transpired in a club that was meant to be a safe space for an already vulnerable group of Americans, but we must never forget that an attack on the LGBT community is an attack on all of us. As we mourn for those whose lives have been touched by this act of barbarism, we must do everything in our collective power to put an end to the attitudes and behaviors that help cultivate a society where such hate can come to fruition. Today, Milwaukee stands with the City of Orlando and our nation’s LGBT community.”

Stuart Milk, nephew of Harvey Milk and co-founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation, released the following statement in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida:

“Last night, the worst domestic terror attack since 911 has tragically hit American LGBT families head on—know the latest victims of hatred—mostly young men and women who were simply out for a night of dancing and enjoyment of our community during LGBT Pride month. These victims of a hate crime targeting an LGBT club had their futures stolen, had their dreams stolen, their potential contributions stolen from us all.

The LGBT Orlando community and our allies in Central Florida are both strong and unified. We send a world of love and prayers to all who are grieving today and to all who will begin the hard journey to recover from untold wounds, both physical and emotional. But our love and prayers are simply not enough. Hate and separation continue to bring forth too much grief, too many stolen lives across the whole world.

As we reach out to comfort the Orlando families, and as we support the courage for the injured to heal, may we also have the strength to address and deal with the roots of hatred and separation that target any minority community with violence, anywhere in the world. May we find a way forward to make this act of horrendous violence a commitment to come together and so honor the memories of those who were killed today.”

*The Chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), a coalition of 40 of the nation’s preeminent Latino advocacy organizations, issued the following statement in response to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse nightclub, and expressing solidarity with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community.

“We stand in solidarity with our LGBTQ brothers and sisters who were targeted in this heinous attack in Orlando, in which initial reports suggest that the brunt of the suffering fell upon LGBTQ Latinos. We share our deepest condolences and sympathy with the families and loved ones of those who were killed. This was an attack on all of us,” said Hector Sanchez, NHLA Chair and Executive Director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement. “We hope that those who were injured are able to make a full recovery and encourage all those who are able, to donate blood as soon as possible at the nearest blood donation center to help the survivors.”

Equality Federation released the following statement: “Our hearts are heavy at this time and we extend our love and condolences to the friends and family of those affected by the horrific tragedy in Orlando.

Pulse nightclub was founded in part to honor a man who had died of AIDS and to promote awareness of the local LGBTQ community. Nightlife venues have historically been places of refuge for LGBTQ people and continue to serve an important role, keeping our community vibrant and connected.

This outrageous, senseless act of terror comes during Pride month when LGBTQ people around the world are celebrating the progress we’ve made towards achieving peace and equality for all. It impacts all of us. We need everyone to be united in the struggle against violence and discrimination.”

“Our hearts are with the LGBTQ and entire Orlando community. Any violence is unacceptable in our society. And while our community has made historic strides in acceptance and equality, this tragedy is a painful reminder of the dangers LGBTQ people continue to face every day.”

The Center is co-sponsoring a vigil tonight at 8 p.m. at Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco. We will mourn, honor, and remember the victims and recommit to peace and our continuing purse of full LGBTQ equality.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is outraged at the attack on the Pulse Club in Orlando, Florida, which specifically targeted the LGBT community. The Museum expressed its condolences to the many families and friends who lost loved ones in this depraved act.

The perpetrator had reportedly expressed allegiance to ISIS reminding us of the continuing dangers extremist ideologies pose. Regardless of whether this was a hate crime or an act of terrorism, the intent was to murder members of the LGBT community. During the Nazi era, the Germans dramatically intensified their persecution of homosexuals who were deemed unfit for the “Aryan community.” Some 50,000 were sent to prison and between 5,000 and 15,000 were incarcerated in concentration camps where many perished.

A living memorial to the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum inspires citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity. Its far-reaching educational programs and global impact are made possible by generous donors. For more information, visit www.ushmm.org.

Florida State Senator, Geraldine Thompson, spoke to CNN regarding “getting serious about gun reform,” a statement made by Sen. Thompson since she represents the district where the night club resides. “Every time we talk about mass shootings we talk reform, but nothing is done.”

The shooter was a U.S. citizen born in New York in 1986. He had active security officer and fire arm silences, according to Florida records, reported NBC News.

Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla. whose district also include the area of the shooting said, “It’s no coincidence that the attack took place when it did and where it did. It might be that we’ve seen the commission of an awful hate crime. This comes on the cusp of celebrating Gay Pride.

President Obama’s address to the nation happened about the hate crime took place close to 2 p.m. EST on June 12.

Followed categories will be added to My News.

US President Barack Obama has made a statment condemning the attack, the worst mass shooting in American history. The president has called the shooting a “horrific massacre” and an act of terrorism and hate. “Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” Obama said in a public address.

“The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism,” he said. “And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened.”

The president said the attack was “especially heartbreaking” for those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. “The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub—it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.”

He also made a point about the ease at which people can get their hands on deadly weapons. “This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

Obama has ordered that all flags at the White House and other government buildings be lowered to half-mast in respect to the victims.

The club where the shooting occurred took to Facebook and Twitter to thank the public for their support: “Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event. Thank you for your thoughts and love.”

One Pulse patron, who managed to escape the club unharmed, expressed his disbelief at the situation. “I was thinking, ‘Are you kidding me?’ So I just dropped down. I just said, ‘Please, please, please, I want to make it out.’ And when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood,” said Christopher Hansen, who was in the VIP lounge when the shooting broke out.

Local authorities have also made statements about the shooting. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, said “This is an incident, as I see it, that we certainly classify as domestic terror incident”, while Florida Governer Rick Sott said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, families and all those affected by this horrific tragedy. We are a strong and resilient state and we will devote every resource available to assist with the shooting in Orlando.”

Equality Florida spoke out about the anti-gay sentiment behind the attack. “We are heartbroken and angry that senseless violence has once again destroyed lives in our state and in our country. Gay clubs hold a significant place in LGBTQ history. They were often the only safe gathering place and this horrific act strikes directly at our sense of safety.”

Meanwhile, people worldwide have responded to the event on social media platforms, with hashtags such as #Orlando, #PulseNightclub, #gunsense, #ThoughtsAndPrayers, #PulseShooting, #LoveConquersHate, #GunReformNOW, #Islamophobia and #TheNRA all trending on Twitter. World leaders have also sent their condolences to those affected by the tragedy and condemned the attack.

Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted: “Woke up to hear the devastating news from FL. As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act.”

Clinton later posted the following statement on Facebook, vowing to fight terrorism and crimes of hate. She also stated that something needs to be done to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.

Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump tweeted: “Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?” Tweet from Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate.

In a statement, French President Francois Hollande said he “condemns with horror” the mass killing in Florida and “expresses the full support of France and the French with America’s authorities and its people in this difficult time”.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said, “My thoughts go out to the victims, to which I offer my condolences, as well as the many wounded, to whom I wish a speedy recovery. I express my solidarity to the American people and its authorities in this terrible ordeal.”

Britain’s Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that he was “horrified” by the attack.

Italian Premier Matteo Renzi posted, “Our heart is with our American brothers.”

Deputy Prime Minister of Republic of Turkey, Mehmet Simsek, tweeted: “I condemn, unequivocally, the horrific terrorist attack in #Orlando - as we’ve seen time & again, terrorism knows no religion, creed or race.”

Rasha Mubarak, Orlando regional co-ordinator for Florida’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, expressed similar sentiments. “We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence.” .

Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff of California said he would be marching in a gay pride parade in solidarity with the victims. “This morning, I will be marching in the West Hollywood Pride Parade with a heavy heart, but we will march in solidarity with all those who are the victims of terrorism and hatred.”

And the outpouring from the general public has been filled with messages of frustration and anger over gun violence and lax guns laws.","WORLD leaders, authorities and the public have expressed their shock and devastation at the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. At least 50 people were killed and dozens of others wounded, when a gunman wielding an assault-type rifle opened fire in the club before dying in a gunfight with SWAT officers."

Breaking news from Orlando, Fla. via CNN, about the FBI issuing bulletins to gay clubs as a precaution. The FBI has listed the massacre as both a hate crime and an act of terrorism.

The press conference also shed some light about Noor Salman, the killer’s wife, making it official that she knew of the “killer’s thirst for attack,” but they don’t think Salman was a co-conspirator. In addition, they reported that the gunman had befriended transgender women on gay sites and visited online gay chat rooms.

According to a CNN interview with Salman, the widowers said “she is not sure if Omar Saddiqui Mateen, her ex-husband and father of her son, was gay or not. She added, in the interview with CNN’s Don Lemon, that being “homosexual” brings shame to their families. She also, said that Mateen’s father was not tolerant of the “homosexual way of life,” and added that neither is she.

Authorities find that Salman may be a person of interest and are trying to find out if she is a co-conspirator in the attack that killed 49 innocent people and injured 53 others in the morning of June 12. Main media networks have questioned about her possible involvement or knowledge she may have had about the shooting. Salman was born in California. Her parents are Palestinian.

Update: President Obama spoke to the nation, after getting briefed by the FBI and Homeland Security today, called the Orlando shooting “homegrown extremism,” something that has worried the administration for some time. While at the last minute the shooter expressed allegiance to Isil, he did not appear to be part of a broader Isil plot, said the President.

He said organizations like IS, al-Qaida and others target gays and lesbians because of their ‘‘vicious, bankrupt ideology’’ and their religious beliefs about homosexuality.

‘‘The fact that it took place at a club frequented by the LGBT community I think is also relevant,’’ Obama said.

He noted that the attack underscored the “risks we were taking by being so lax on firearms.” The President also said these sort of events tended to devolve into an “either-or” debate over gun control versus terrorism. He said they were still looking at “all the possible motivations of the killer.”

Update: A Torrington, Conn. native with ties in Massachusetts for over a decade, was working for Pulse at the time of the shooting. KJ Morris, 37, has been confirmed as one of the victims of the massacre at the night club. Morris was a bouncer at Pulse and had moved to Fla. only two months ago, according to her FB page. She was a well known drag king in western New England, often performing at various area clubs under the stage name “Daddy K.”

A Springfield, Mass. resident, Stanley Manolo Almodovar III, 23, was also another victim. Born and raised in Springfield, Almodovar moved to Clermont, Fla. in 2004, according to CBS Boston.

Update: President orders the American flag to be flown at half staff everywhere in the U.S. and abroad in U.S Offices. President Obama’s addressed the most deadly mass shooting in the U.S. history via the following statement.

THE PRESIDENT: Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder—a horrific massacre—of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city. Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.

I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisors. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I’ve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation.

We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We’ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what—if any—inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us.

This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need—they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come.

We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm’s way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It’s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough.

So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American—regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation—is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.

Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.

In the coming hours and days, we’ll learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families—that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more—as a country—by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us.

As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts—friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.

May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love. Thank you.

Update: A suspect with arsenal arrested at L.A. Gay Pride, the city of West Hollywood is in heightened alert.

Although many cities have been celebrating LGBT Pride in June throughout the country, one city in the country is mourning. A Gay Club in Orlando, Florida was the site of what many are considering the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the nation and the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, according to CNN.

Pulse, one of the biggest nightclubs in Orlando, Florida, was holding, according to BBC News, a Latin-themed event that was nearing its end when a man opened fire inside. Shortly afterwards, the nightclub posted on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.”

Mayor Buddy Dyer said to USA Today that 53 wounded in the attack at Pulse, 1912 S Orange Ave., a gay club just south of downtown. Other news sources are reporting 50 people were killed.

NBC News reported that Mina Justice was outside the club trying to contact her 30-year-old son Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: “He’s coming.”

“The next text said: ‘He has us, and he’s in here with us,'” she told The Associated Press. “That was the last conversation.”

According to CNN, the shooter has been identified as Omar Saddiqui Mateen, of Port St. Lucie Fla. who had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Pro ISIS/islamic forums are responding with excitement to the shooting, although no group has claimed responsibility for the massacre yet.

USA Today reported that Police Chief John Mina said the tragedy “began at 2:02 a.m., when three police officers engaged the suspect in a gun battle outside the club. A hostage situation then took place inside, and a SWAT team was called in, Mina said. Police received updates from patrons trapped in the club, and decided to storm the club at about 5 a.m.”

“Our biggest concern was further loss of life,” Mina said. “We exchanged gunfire with the suspect, and he was dead at the scene.”

Florida Governor, Rick Scott, has declared a state of emergency following the massacre. Scott told CNN that this was “clearly an act of terrorism,” adding too that it “should make every American angry.”

Steve Boswell, President and CEO of Fenway Health, released the following statement:

“Our hearts are with our grieving community in Orlando and with our larger community where people are hurting today. This atrocious act of terror and hate is beyond comprehension. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and loved ones and the many lives they touched.

“As the nation continues to grapple with gun violence and important questions related to community safety in the aftermath of this and the far too many events like it, we urge our political leaders, policy makers, the media, and citizen activists to take action to ensure public safety. We must demand the right to live in a safe and peaceful society.

“In Orlando, patrons at an LGBT bar were targeted. Coming during LGBT Pride Month, a time when we come together to celebrate our lives and each other, this attack is an assault on the entire LGBT community.

“We’ll learn more as events unfold in the coming days, but let’s focus on staying strong, staying proud and staying united against hate and intolerance. When we stand together, we are strong and we are beautiful.”

“All of us at MassEquality are shocked and deeply saddened by the news from Orlando, FL this morning. Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, the Orlando LGBTQ and Latin@ communities, and all who have been touched by this terrible event.

“We are horrified that the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history took place in a gay nightclub during Pride month–a time when the LGBTQ community and its allies join together to celebrate our history and look ahead to a future when we hope everyone can live free from discrimination and violence. The fact that those who were killed and wounded were at the club on Latin night painfully highlights the racist violence faced by so many members of our community.

MassEquality is the leading statewide grassroots advocacy organization working to ensure that everyone across Massachusetts can thrive from cradle to grave without discrimination and oppression based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

“From the entire Fenway Health family: Our hearts are with our grieving community in Orlando, and with our community everywhere where people are hurting today,” read a statement released by Fenway Health. “In the face of hate and intolerance, let’s all remember that we are strong together, and we are beautiful.”

“Words do not express the shock and sadness I feel,” said Elias Vivas, Interim Director, Hispanic Black Gay Coalition, HBGC. “The state of LGBTQ rights greatly depends on the continued work to undo homophobia, transphobia, islamophobia and racism that will surface as a result of this tragedy. These horrific events should not be the only way we are motived to make change — we have a lot of work to do to support our LGBTQ communities. My condolences go out to those families grieving this Sunday.”

Rhode Island Pride and the RI LGBTQ Center stand together in solidarity with those touched by the recent mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse LGBT club.

Our hearts are with our Florida brothers and sisters, their families and all those affected by this senseless act. We lament the agonizing loss of life, and we are renewed in our commitment to create a safer world.

The vibrant light of our LGBTQ community will not be extinguished by violence or terror.

Michael Adams, SAGE CEO and Dr. Yanira Cruz, NHCOA President & CEO released the following joint statement:

“Many constituents of SAGE (Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders) are Latino and many constituents of NHCOA (National Hispanic Council on Aging) are LGBT.

“Words cannot express our grief at the senseless loss of so many – including many LGBT Latino people, in the heinous massacre at Pulse in Orlando.

“The tragedy last night at Pulse, reminds us that we cannot be divided into disconnected communities and that our lives, our cultures, our identities and our goals intersect in ways large and small.

“Knowing this, we condemn not only the violence in Orlando, but also any effort to hijack this tragedy to advance an agenda of bigotry and hatred against immigrants, Muslims or any other community.

“We will not allow the lost lives of our LGBT and Latino brothers and sisters to be devalued in this way. Our diversity is a source of strength, and must not be used to create division. Thus, we will stand strong for justice and equity for every member of every community in this extraordinarily diverse country.”

SAGE (Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders) is the country’s largest and oldest organization dedicated to improving the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) older adults.

Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-04) released the following statement: “My heart aches over the tragic events that took place last night in Orlando, Florida. As details about this horrific incident emerge—including the background of the perpetrator—make no mistake, this was indeed an act of terror. This savage act was carried out in an effort to intimidate and terrify our LGBT brothers and sisters.

“This senseless loss of life transpired in a club that was meant to be a safe space for an already vulnerable group of Americans, but we must never forget that an attack on the LGBT community is an attack on all of us. As we mourn for those whose lives have been touched by this act of barbarism, we must do everything in our collective power to put an end to the attitudes and behaviors that help cultivate a society where such hate can come to fruition. Today, Milwaukee stands with the City of Orlando and our nation’s LGBT community.”

Stuart Milk, nephew of Harvey Milk and co-founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation, released the following statement in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida:

“Last night, the worst domestic terror attack since 911 has tragically hit American LGBT families head on—know the latest victims of hatred—mostly young men and women who were simply out for a night of dancing and enjoyment of our community during LGBT Pride month. These victims of a hate crime targeting an LGBT club had their futures stolen, had their dreams stolen, their potential contributions stolen from us all.

The LGBT Orlando community and our allies in Central Florida are both strong and unified. We send a world of love and prayers to all who are grieving today and to all who will begin the hard journey to recover from untold wounds, both physical and emotional. But our love and prayers are simply not enough. Hate and separation continue to bring forth too much grief, too many stolen lives across the whole world.

As we reach out to comfort the Orlando families, and as we support the courage for the injured to heal, may we also have the strength to address and deal with the roots of hatred and separation that target any minority community with violence, anywhere in the world. May we find a way forward to make this act of horrendous violence a commitment to come together and so honor the memories of those who were killed today.”

*The Chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), a coalition of 40 of the nation’s preeminent Latino advocacy organizations, issued the following statement in response to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse nightclub, and expressing solidarity with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community.

“We stand in solidarity with our LGBTQ brothers and sisters who were targeted in this heinous attack in Orlando, in which initial reports suggest that the brunt of the suffering fell upon LGBTQ Latinos. We share our deepest condolences and sympathy with the families and loved ones of those who were killed. This was an attack on all of us,” said Hector Sanchez, NHLA Chair and Executive Director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement. “We hope that those who were injured are able to make a full recovery and encourage all those who are able, to donate blood as soon as possible at the nearest blood donation center to help the survivors.”

Equality Federation released the following statement: “Our hearts are heavy at this time and we extend our love and condolences to the friends and family of those affected by the horrific tragedy in Orlando.

Pulse nightclub was founded in part to honor a man who had died of AIDS and to promote awareness of the local LGBTQ community. Nightlife venues have historically been places of refuge for LGBTQ people and continue to serve an important role, keeping our community vibrant and connected.

This outrageous, senseless act of terror comes during Pride month when LGBTQ people around the world are celebrating the progress we’ve made towards achieving peace and equality for all. It impacts all of us. We need everyone to be united in the struggle against violence and discrimination.”

“Our hearts are with the LGBTQ and entire Orlando community. Any violence is unacceptable in our society. And while our community has made historic strides in acceptance and equality, this tragedy is a painful reminder of the dangers LGBTQ people continue to face every day.”

The Center is co-sponsoring a vigil tonight at 8 p.m. at Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco. We will mourn, honor, and remember the victims and recommit to peace and our continuing purse of full LGBTQ equality.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is outraged at the attack on the Pulse Club in Orlando, Florida, which specifically targeted the LGBT community. The Museum expressed its condolences to the many families and friends who lost loved ones in this depraved act.

The perpetrator had reportedly expressed allegiance to ISIS reminding us of the continuing dangers extremist ideologies pose. Regardless of whether this was a hate crime or an act of terrorism, the intent was to murder members of the LGBT community. During the Nazi era, the Germans dramatically intensified their persecution of homosexuals who were deemed unfit for the “Aryan community.” Some 50,000 were sent to prison and between 5,000 and 15,000 were incarcerated in concentration camps where many perished.

A living memorial to the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum inspires citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity.

Florida State Senator, Geraldine Thompson, spoke to CNN regarding “getting serious about gun reform,” a statement made by Sen. Thompson since she represents the district where the night club resides. “Every time we talk about mass shootings we talk reform, but nothing is done.”

The shooter was a U.S. citizen born in New York in 1986. He had active security officer and fire arm silences, according to Florida records, reported NBC News.

Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla. whose district also include the area of the shooting said, “It’s no coincidence that the attack took place when it did and where it did. It might be that we’ve seen the commission of an awful hate crime. This comes on the cusp of celebrating Gay Pride.

Breaking news from Orlando, Fla. via CNN, about the FBI issuing bulletins to gay clubs as a precaution. The FBI has listed the massacre as both a hate crime and an act of terrorism.

The press conference also shed some light about Noor Salman, the killer’s wife, making it official that she knew of the “killer’s thirst for attack,” but they don’t think Salman was a co-conspirator. In addition, they reported that the gunman had befriended transgender women on gay sites and visited online gay chat rooms.

According to a CNN interview with Salman, the widowers said “she is not sure if Omar Saddiqui Mateen, her ex-husband and father of her son, was gay or not. She added, in the interview with CNN’s Don Lemon, that being “homosexual” brings shame to their families. She also, said that Mateen’s father was not tolerant of the “homosexual way of life,” and added that neither is she.

Authorities find that Salman may be a person of interest and are trying to find out if she is a co-conspirator in the attack that killed 49 innocent people and injured 53 others in the morning of June 12. Main media networks have questioned about her possible involvement or knowledge she may have had about the shooting. Salman was born in California. Her parents are Palestinian.

Update: President Obama spoke to the nation, after getting briefed by the FBI and Homeland Security today, called the Orlando shooting “homegrown extremism,” something that has worried the administration for some time. While at the last minute the shooter expressed allegiance to Isil, he did not appear to be part of a broader Isil plot, said the President.

He said organizations like IS, al-Qaida and others target gays and lesbians because of their ‘‘vicious, bankrupt ideology’’ and their religious beliefs about homosexuality.

‘‘The fact that it took place at a club frequented by the LGBT community I think is also relevant,’’ Obama said.

He noted that the attack underscored the “risks we were taking by being so lax on firearms.” The President also said these sort of events tended to devolve into an “either-or” debate over gun control versus terrorism. He said they were still looking at “all the possible motivations of the killer.”

Update: A Torrington, Conn. native with ties in Massachusetts for over a decade, was working for Pulse at the time of the shooting. KJ Morris, 37, has been confirmed as one of the victims of the massacre at the night club. Morris was a bouncer at Pulse and had moved to Fla. only two months ago, according to her FB page. She was a well known drag king in western New England, often performing at various area clubs under the stage name “Daddy K.”

A Springfield, Mass. resident, Stanley Manolo Almodovar III, 23, was also another victim. Born and raised in Springfield, Almodovar moved to Clermont, Fla. in 2004, according to CBS Boston.

Update: President orders the American flag to be flown at half staff everywhere in the U.S. and abroad in U.S Offices. President Obama’s addressed the most deadly mass shooting in the U.S. history via the following statement.

THE PRESIDENT: Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder—a horrific massacre—of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando, who have endured a terrible attack on their city. Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.

I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my homeland security and national security advisors. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation, in partnership with local law enforcement. I’ve directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation.

We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We’ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism. And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what—if any—inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened, and we will go wherever the facts lead us.

This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed the condolences of the entire American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer that whatever help he and the people of Orlando need—they are going to get it. As a country, we will be there for the people of Orlando today, tomorrow and for all the days to come.

We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed into harm’s way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives, and kept the carnage from being even worse. It’s the kind of sacrifice that our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough.

So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American—regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation—is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. And no act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.

Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.

In the coming hours and days, we’ll learn about the victims of this tragedy. Their names. Their faces. Who they were. The joy that they brought to families and to friends, and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them and say a prayer for their families—that God give them the strength to bear the unbearable. And that He give us all the strength to be there for them, and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more—as a country—by the way they lived their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us.

As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts—friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.

May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love. Thank you.

Update: A suspect with arsenal arrested at L.A. Gay Pride, the city of West Hollywood is in heightened alert.

Although many cities have been celebrating LGBT Pride in June throughout the country, one city in the country is mourning. A Gay Club in Orlando, Florida was the site of what many are considering the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the nation and the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, according to CNN.

Pulse, one of the biggest nightclubs in Orlando, Florida, was holding, according to BBC News, a Latin-themed event that was nearing its end when a man opened fire inside. Shortly afterwards, the nightclub posted on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.”

Mayor Buddy Dyer said to USA Today that 53 wounded in the attack at Pulse, 1912 S Orange Ave., a gay club just south of downtown. Other news sources are reporting 50 people were killed.

NBC News reported that Mina Justice was outside the club trying to contact her 30-year-old son Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: “He’s coming.”

“The next text said: ‘He has us, and he’s in here with us,'” she told The Associated Press. “That was the last conversation.”

According to CNN, the shooter has been identified as Omar Saddiqui Mateen, of Port St. Lucie Fla. who had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Pro ISIS/islamic forums are responding with excitement to the shooting, although no group has claimed responsibility for the massacre yet.

USA Today reported that Police Chief John Mina said the tragedy “began at 2:02 a.m., when three police officers engaged the suspect in a gun battle outside the club. A hostage situation then took place inside, and a SWAT team was called in, Mina said. Police received updates from patrons trapped in the club, and decided to storm the club at about 5 a.m.”

“Our biggest concern was further loss of life,” Mina said. “We exchanged gunfire with the suspect, and he was dead at the scene.”

Florida Governor, Rick Scott, has declared a state of emergency following the massacre. Scott told CNN that this was “clearly an act of terrorism,” adding too that it “should make every American angry.”

Steve Boswell, President and CEO of Fenway Health, released the following statement:

“Our hearts are with our grieving community in Orlando and with our larger community where people are hurting today. This atrocious act of terror and hate is beyond comprehension. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and loved ones and the many lives they touched.

“As the nation continues to grapple with gun violence and important questions related to community safety in the aftermath of this and the far too many events like it, we urge our political leaders, policy makers, the media, and citizen activists to take action to ensure public safety. We must demand the right to live in a safe and peaceful society.

“In Orlando, patrons at an LGBT bar were targeted. Coming during LGBT Pride Month, a time when we come together to celebrate our lives and each other, this attack is an assault on the entire LGBT community.

“We’ll learn more as events unfold in the coming days, but let’s focus on staying strong, staying proud and staying united against hate and intolerance. When we stand together, we are strong and we are beautiful.”

“All of us at MassEquality are shocked and deeply saddened by the news from Orlando, FL this morning. Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, the Orlando LGBTQ and Latin@ communities, and all who have been touched by this terrible event.

“We are horrified that the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history took place in a gay nightclub during Pride month–a time when the LGBTQ community and its allies join together to celebrate our history and look ahead to a future when we hope everyone can live free from discrimination and violence. The fact that those who were killed and wounded were at the club on Latin night painfully highlights the racist violence faced by so many members of our community.

MassEquality is the leading statewide grassroots advocacy organization working to ensure that everyone across Massachusetts can thrive from cradle to grave without discrimination and oppression based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

“From the entire Fenway Health family: Our hearts are with our grieving community in Orlando, and with our community everywhere where people are hurting today,” read a statement released by Fenway Health. “In the face of hate and intolerance, let’s all remember that we are strong together, and we are beautiful.”

“Words do not express the shock and sadness I feel,” said Elias Vivas, Interim Director, Hispanic Black Gay Coalition, HBGC. “The state of LGBTQ rights greatly depends on the continued work to undo homophobia, transphobia, islamophobia and racism that will surface as a result of this tragedy. These horrific events should not be the only way we are motived to make change — we have a lot of work to do to support our LGBTQ communities. My condolences go out to those families grieving this Sunday.”

Rhode Island Pride and the RI LGBTQ Center stand together in solidarity with those touched by the recent mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse LGBT club.

Our hearts are with our Florida brothers and sisters, their families and all those affected by this senseless act. We lament the agonizing loss of life, and we are renewed in our commitment to create a safer world.

The vibrant light of our LGBTQ community will not be extinguished by violence or terror.

Michael Adams, SAGE CEO and Dr. Yanira Cruz, NHCOA President & CEO released the following joint statement:

“Many constituents of SAGE (Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders) are Latino and many constituents of NHCOA (National Hispanic Council on Aging) are LGBT.

“Words cannot express our grief at the senseless loss of so many – including many LGBT Latino people, in the heinous massacre at Pulse in Orlando.

“The tragedy last night at Pulse, reminds us that we cannot be divided into disconnected communities and that our lives, our cultures, our identities and our goals intersect in ways large and small.

“Knowing this, we condemn not only the violence in Orlando, but also any effort to hijack this tragedy to advance an agenda of bigotry and hatred against immigrants, Muslims or any other community.

“We will not allow the lost lives of our LGBT and Latino brothers and sisters to be devalued in this way. Our diversity is a source of strength, and must not be used to create division. Thus, we will stand strong for justice and equity for every member of every community in this extraordinarily diverse country.”

SAGE (Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders) is the country’s largest and oldest organization dedicated to improving the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) older adults. Founded in 1978 and headquartered in New York City, SAGE is a national organization that offers supportive services and consumer resources to LGBT older adults and their caregivers, advocates for public policy changes that address the needs of LGBT older people, and provides training for aging providers and LGBT organizations through its National Resource Center on LGBT Aging.

Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-04) released the following statement: “My heart aches over the tragic events that took place last night in Orlando, Florida. As details about this horrific incident emerge—including the background of the perpetrator—make no mistake, this was indeed an act of terror. This savage act was carried out in an effort to intimidate and terrify our LGBT brothers and sisters.

“This senseless loss of life transpired in a club that was meant to be a safe space for an already vulnerable group of Americans, but we must never forget that an attack on the LGBT community is an attack on all of us. As we mourn for those whose lives have been touched by this act of barbarism, we must do everything in our collective power to put an end to the attitudes and behaviors that help cultivate a society where such hate can come to fruition. Today, Milwaukee stands with the City of Orlando and our nation’s LGBT community.”

Stuart Milk, nephew of Harvey Milk and co-founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation, released the following statement in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida:

“Last night, the worst domestic terror attack since 911 has tragically hit American LGBT families head on—know the latest victims of hatred—mostly young men and women who were simply out for a night of dancing and enjoyment of our community during LGBT Pride month. These victims of a hate crime targeting an LGBT club had their futures stolen, had their dreams stolen, their potential contributions stolen from us all.

The LGBT Orlando community and our allies in Central Florida are both strong and unified. We send a world of love and prayers to all who are grieving today and to all who will begin the hard journey to recover from untold wounds, both physical and emotional. But our love and prayers are simply not enough. Hate and separation continue to bring forth too much grief, too many stolen lives across the whole world.

As we reach out to comfort the Orlando families, and as we support the courage for the injured to heal, may we also have the strength to address and deal with the roots of hatred and separation that target any minority community with violence, anywhere in the world. May we find a way forward to make this act of horrendous violence a commitment to come together and so honor the memories of those who were killed today.”

*The Chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), a coalition of 40 of the nation’s preeminent Latino advocacy organizations, issued the following statement in response to the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse nightclub, and expressing solidarity with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community.

“We stand in solidarity with our LGBTQ brothers and sisters who were targeted in this heinous attack in Orlando, in which initial reports suggest that the brunt of the suffering fell upon LGBTQ Latinos. We share our deepest condolences and sympathy with the families and loved ones of those who were killed. This was an attack on all of us,” said Hector Sanchez, NHLA Chair and Executive Director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement. “We hope that those who were injured are able to make a full recovery and encourage all those who are able, to donate blood as soon as possible at the nearest blood donation center to help the survivors.”

Equality Federation released the following statement: “Our hearts are heavy at this time and we extend our love and condolences to the friends and family of those affected by the horrific tragedy in Orlando.

Pulse nightclub was founded in part to honor a man who had died of AIDS and to promote awareness of the local LGBTQ community. Nightlife venues have historically been places of refuge for LGBTQ people and continue to serve an important role, keeping our community vibrant and connected.

This outrageous, senseless act of terror comes during Pride month when LGBTQ people around the world are celebrating the progress we’ve made towards achieving peace and equality for all. It impacts all of us. We need everyone to be united in the struggle against violence and discrimination.”

“Our hearts are with the LGBTQ and entire Orlando community. Any violence is unacceptable in our society. And while our community has made historic strides in acceptance and equality, this tragedy is a painful reminder of the dangers LGBTQ people continue to face every day.”

The Center is co-sponsoring a vigil tonight at 8 p.m. at Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco. We will mourn, honor, and remember the victims and recommit to peace and our continuing purse of full LGBTQ equality.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is outraged at the attack on the Pulse Club in Orlando, Florida, which specifically targeted the LGBT community. The Museum expressed its condolences to the many families and friends who lost loved ones in this depraved act.

The perpetrator had reportedly expressed allegiance to ISIS reminding us of the continuing dangers extremist ideologies pose. Regardless of whether this was a hate crime or an act of terrorism, the intent was to murder members of the LGBT community. During the Nazi era, the Germans dramatically intensified their persecution of homosexuals who were deemed unfit for the “Aryan community.” Some 50,000 were sent to prison and between 5,000 and 15,000 were incarcerated in concentration camps where many perished.

A living memorial to the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum inspires citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity.

He was reportedly briefed by Lisa Monaco, the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, on the shooting, which resulted in at least 50 deaths and more than 50 injured.

According to the statement, Obama's asked for regular updates as federal and local officials gather more information.

In the time since the shooting ended, the gunman was killed and identified, and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared a state of emergency.

Obama started speaking about the shooting at around 2:00 pm Sunday, and his weakened resolve about gun vilence was palpable.

Though Obama's made gun control important to his administration, he's never been able to get common sense gun regulations passed. Gun control was the cornerstone of a speech where Obama became emotional over the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and it running in the undercurrent of his speech today.

According to a statement in the press conference, this would be the 15th time Obama spoke about a mass shooting.

In his remarks, Obama said,

The president also ordered all US government flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims.

The vice president was also briefed on the situation and offered his prayers and condolences.

Presidential candidates and politicians also weighed in on the tragedy.

In a statement, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting occurred, called the Orlando shooting part of an ""epidemic"" that ""will continue without end if Congress continues to sit on its hands and do nothing, again.”

Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,""

Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, tweeted a statement about the shooting.

Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also tweeted about the shooting.

As many have noted here and on social media, the shooting's timing is ironic given that Obama just declared June to be lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride month. Surely the irony wasn't lost on Obama who only just spoke about gay pride and LGBT equality and activism on Saturday.

As The White House said, ""When all Americans are treated equal, we are all more free."" Now, if only we could listen to Obama on common sense gun control, then maybe we wouldn't have to deal with a new mass shooting every day. Who knows when the next deadliest shooting in US history will occur if we all don't do something about it.

US President Barack Obama has made a statment condemning the attack, the worst mass shooting in American history. The president has called the shooting a “horrific massacre” and an act of terrorism and hate. “Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” Obama said in a public address.

“The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism,” he said. “And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened.”

The president said the attack was “especially heartbreaking” for those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. “The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub—it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.”

He also made a point about the ease at which people can get their hands on deadly weapons. “This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

Obama has ordered that all flags at the White House and other government buildings be lowered to half-mast in respect to the victims.

The club where the shooting occurred took to Facebook and Twitter to thank the public for their support: “Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event. Thank you for your thoughts and love.”

One Pulse patron, who managed to escape the club unharmed, expressed his disbelief at the situation. “I was thinking, ‘Are you kidding me?’ So I just dropped down. I just said, ‘Please, please, please, I want to make it out.’ And when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood,” said Christopher Hansen, who was in the VIP lounge when the shooting broke out.

Local authorities have also made statements about the shooting. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, said “This is an incident, as I see it, that we certainly classify as domestic terror incident”, while Florida Governer Rick Sott said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, families and all those affected by this horrific tragedy. We are a strong and resilient state and we will devote every resource available to assist with the shooting in Orlando.”

Equality Florida spoke out about the anti-gay sentiment behind the attack. “We are heartbroken and angry that senseless violence has once again destroyed lives in our state and in our country. Gay clubs hold a significant place in LGBTQ history. They were often the only safe gathering place and this horrific act strikes directly at our sense of safety.”

Meanwhile, people worldwide have responded to the event on social media platforms, with hashtags such as #Orlando, #PulseNightclub, #gunsense, #ThoughtsAndPrayers, #PulseShooting, #LoveConquersHate, #GunReformNOW, #Islamophobia and #TheNRA all trending on Twitter. World leaders have also sent their condolences to those affected by the tragedy and condemned the attack.

""We grieve the brutal murder of dozens of innocent people.""

50 people were killed, and 53 others injured at a LGBT nighclub in Orlando early Sunday morning.



According to multiple news reports, Omar Mateen was identified as the gunman who opened fire at Pulse Nightclub. Investigators in a press conference confirmed they recovered a handgun and an AR-15 type of assault rifle.

Speaking from the White House, Obama says the United States has to decide if that is the ""country we want to be."" He says that doing nothing is a decision as well.

Flags were ordered to fly at half staff.

The shooting has thrust the topic of gun control back into focus as a presidential election nears.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has called for expanding background checks to sales at gun shows and online purchases, and for reinstating a ban on assault weapons. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said the existing background check system should be fixed, not expanded, and that assault-weapons bans do not work.

The White House released the following statement after news of the shooting broke:

Florida Gov. Rick Scott said authorities were working to contact family members of the victims who were killed and injured in the shooting.



He called the attack ""clearly an act of terror.""

Obama last spoke to the nation addressing a mass-casualty event after a shooting in Roseburg, Oregon that left 13 people dead in the fall of 2015 at Umpqua Community College.

US President Barack Obama has made a statment condemning the attack, the worst mass shooting in American history. The president has called the shooting a “horrific massacre” and an act of terrorism and hate. “Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” Obama said in a public address.

“The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism,” he said. “And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened.”

The president said the attack was “especially heartbreaking” for those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. “The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub—it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.”

He also made a point about the ease at which people can get their hands on deadly weapons. “This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

Obama has ordered that all flags at the White House and other government buildings be lowered to half-mast in respect to the victims.

The club where the shooting occurred took to Facebook and Twitter to thank the public for their support: “Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event. Thank you for your thoughts and love.”

It was toward the end of the night at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, when club-goer Christopher Hansen had taken his first sip from a drink and heard sharp noises ringing out in succession. He thought it was a beat of the song pulsating in the venue until people started crumpling onto the dance floor.

""I just saw bodies going down. Bang, bang, bang,"" he recalled to NBC News.

The club was packed with more than 300 people for Latin night about 2 a.m. ET Sunday. Hansen said he didn't see the gunman — later identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen — but his first instinct was to get down and crawl away from the center of the shooting as 20 or 30 shots rung out.

""People stomped on me. ... I was zigzagging just in case, because you could still hear the bullets going off,"" he said. ""I was terrified. I was in shock.""

He was already near the exit when he crawled past the bathroom and made it outside to relative safety. There were people bleeding. A man who didn't speak English had a bullet in his back, and his pants were drenched in blood, Hansen said.

He tore off his bandanna and used it to suppress the bleeding.

""I had just seen the movie 'The Conjuring 2'"" before going to the club, Hansen added. ""To go from a horror movie to a real horror, it's just shocking.""

Police say Mateen killed at least 50 people and injured 53 others in what's being described as the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

A motive was still under investigation, although his family told NBC News he may have carried out the carnage after seeing two men kissing in Miami while with his wife and young son. Law enforcement sources told NBC News that Mateen had called 911 before the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

About 5 a.m., authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue club-goers who were being held hostage.

Mateen, who officials say was carrying an AR-15-type rifle with large-capacity magazines, was killed.

Joshua McGill said he and his roommates hid in an employee area of the club before rushing outside.

""During my run across the parking lot, I did hear more shooting, and I ducked behind a car and crawled under the car,"" McGill, a nursing student, told NBC News. ""That’s when I noticed another club-goer staggering, covered in blood, and I helped him get behind the car.""

Jackie Smith, who was also inside the club, said two friends next to her were shot.

""Some guy walked in and started shooting everybody. He had an automatic rifle, so nobody stood a chance,"" Smith told The Associated Press. ""I just tried to get out of there.""

Relatives and friends, many in tears, gathered outside hospitals to learn whether their loved ones were among the dead or wounded.

Smith did not know the conditions of her friends and came out of the hospital and burst into tears.

The wounded included one police officer who was shot and suffered injuries to his face, officials said.

Jon Alamo said he was at the back of one of the club's rooms when a man holding a weapon came into the front of the room.

Club-goer Rob Rick said the shooting started just before closing time.

""Everybody was drinking their last sip,"" he said.

He estimated that more than 100 people were still inside when he heard shots, got on the ground and crawled toward a DJ's booth. A bouncer knocked down a partition between the club area and an area in the back where only workers are allowed — so people inside were able to then escape through the back of the club.

Hansen said he moved to the Orlando area about two months ago and was expecting only to have fun — not to see the night descend into chaos.

""There's sweat and blood, I know it's under my nails,"" he said. ""This is just a tragic situation.""","""People stomped on me,"" said one survivor. ""I was zigzagging just in case, because you could still hear the bullets going off."""

Jon Alamo said he was at the back of one of the club's rooms when a man holding a weapon came into the front of the room.

Club-goer Rob Rick said the shooting started just before closing time.

""Everybody was drinking their last sip,"" he said.

He estimated that more than 100 people were still inside when he heard shots, got on the ground and crawled toward a DJ's booth. A bouncer knocked down a partition between the club area and an area in the back where only workers are allowed — so people inside were able to then escape through the back of the club.

Hansen said he moved to the Orlando area about two months ago and was expecting only to have fun — not to see the night descend into chaos.

""There's sweat and blood, I know it's under my nails,"" he said. ""This is just a tragic situation.""","""People stomped on me,"" said one survivor. ""I was zigzagging just in case, because you could still hear the bullets going off."""

“This incident took place at a gay bar,” Carson stressed to Fox News. “Many people on the left need to understand … they hate gay people. … These people need to be looking at that for their own survival … to be so ideologically driven that they can’t see that is problematic.”

The shooting which killed 50 and injured 53 others took place at Pulse, which bills itself as Orlando’s premier “gay” bar. Officials have identified the suspected gunmen as Omar Mateen, a U.S. citizen of Afghani descent who is a resident of Port St. Lucie, Florida.

James Kallstrom, the former FBI assistant director, agreed with Carson on the threat to homosexuals, saying, “They ought to be petrified. They’re the first people they want to kill or throw off a roof.”

Carson indicated that Americans need to wake up about the threat of terrorism.

“We have to get much more serious about the way we look at potential terrorist activity,” he explained.

“We need to very carefully examine things and the political correctness is beyond the pale.”

Regarding who should be allowed into America, Carson noted that we are a nation of immigrants as President Teddy Roosevelt stated.

What do YOU think? Will Orlando terror affect how people vote for president? Sound off in today’s WND poll.

But Carson added: “We welcome any ethnic groups as long as they want to be Americans. If they don’t, they ought to stay where they are.”",... Read more

Hundreds of young people had packed inside Orlando's Pulse Nightclub for Latino night, a raucous, sweaty dance party featuring bachata, merengue and salsa music. Now close to 2 a.m., the booming party at one of central Florida's most popular gay nightclubs was winding down.

'All of the sudden something sounded like firecrackers going off,' Ray Rivera, the club's DJ, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'I lowered the music, it stopped for a second, then all of the sudden it sounded again. Then I turned the music off and basically everyone was just running out.'

In their midst, a gunman was unloading an assault rifle, mowing down panicked club-goers streaming toward exists, seeking cover or crouching on the ground in fear. Witnesses described dead bodies littering the ground and people tampling over each other in their struggle to stay alive.

'It was just complete chaos,' Rivera added.

Because he was close to an exit to escape, the DJ was one of the lucky ones. Police say 50 others never made it out of the venue's three glitzy rooms, their lives lost in a hail of gunfire that left more than 50 others wounded in what appears to be the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

A few minutes later, Pulse Orlando posted a haunting message on Facebook: 'Everyone get out of pulse and keep running'.

The violence couldn't have come at a worse time. On a 'high capacity night' like Saturday, Benjamin Di'Costa, 25, a former Pulse dancer, told the Miami Herald that as many as 800 people might be packed inside the club.

'This is one of the No. 1 destinations for LGBT people to attend in the summertime,' he told the paper. 'Mostly people from Central Florida, some people come from Tampa to Orlando.'

While police have not publicly identified the gunman, law enforcement officials and relatives on Sunday identified him as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old from Fort Pierce, Fla.

'It's appears he was organized and well-prepared,' Orlando Police Chief John Mina and other officials said Sunday morning said, adding that the shooter had an assault-type weapon, a handgun and 'some type of (other) device on him.'

Once he made his way inside the club, Mateen would have had little trouble exacting harm on a large number of people, said Alex Choy, a former club employee. Choy told the Herald that the club has two main rooms, one for performances and drag shows to the left of the front door and a larger dance room to the right that links to an outdoor patio behind the venue.

'It's a very, very small space,' he said. 'Either room you go into. If you go to your left, there's a small room with the stage. That's what worries me, if there was any type of shooting, it wouldn't take much to get everyone. Very close range.'

Jon Alamo told the Associated Press he was at the back of the club's rooms when saw a man holding a weapon appear in the front of the room.

Christopher Hansen, a club-goer who was inside when the shooting began, told AP that he escaped through the back of the venue by crawling on his elbows and knees.

'When I got across the street there was blood everywhere,' he said. 'I was helping somebody because he was laying down and I wasn't sure if he was dead or alive. I took my bandana off, I shoved it in this hole, the bullet hole that was in his back.

'After everybody was out, the shooting was still going and the cops were still yelling, 'Go! Go! Clear the area, clear the area!'' he added.

Those who survived -- like Hansen, who told the AP that he was in the VIP lounge when the shooting began -- said they were lucky to be alive.

'I was thinking, 'Are you kidding me?'' he said. 'So I just dropped down. I just said, 'Please, please, please, I want to make it out.' And when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood. You hope and pray you don't get shot.'

An officer working at the club exchanged fire with the gunman, authorities said. It was then, according to police, that the incident developed into 'a hostage situation.' Authorities said the man was armed with a 'suspicious device,' in addition to his guns, Mina, the police chief, told reporters.

Within minutes of the shooting, police vehicles and a SWAT team descended on the club.

'I was there,' Ricardo J. Negron posted on the club's Facebook page several hours later. 'Shooter opened fire @ around 2:00am. People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran. I am safely home and hoping everyone gets home safely as well.'

After news of the violence spread, friends and family members began the desperate search for news of their loved ones. Standing outside the dance club early Sunday morning, Mina Justice told the Associated Press that she was trying to contact her son, Eddie, and fearing the worst.

He had texted her earlier, she said, telling her that he ran into a bathroom with others to hide from the gunman.

'The next text said: 'He has us, and he's in here with us,'' Justice told the AP. 'That was the last conversation.'

Hours later, as investigators surveyed the damage, Chief Mina told reporters Sunday morning that even veteran police officers and members of the SWAT team struggled to wrap their minds around the level of carnage inside the club.

'Just to look into the eyes of our officers told the whole story,' he said. 'You could tell that they were all shaken by this incident, by what they saw inside the club. They did an unbelievable job in rescuing as many as 30 hostages.'

'This kind of tragedy takes a toll on everyone, even law enforcement officers,' he added.

For members of central Florida's gay community, the club was more than a place to dance, it was also a place to convene with family.

'Pulse is like a family,' Di'Costa told the Herald. 'Everybody who works there is treated equally. Treated like brothers and sisters. When somebody is hurting or in need, we always look out for each other.'","They were taking the final sips of their drinks, closing tabs at the bar and arranging rides home. Hundreds of …"

Several leaders of different faiths and the LGBT community gathered at the offices of Council on American-Islamic Relations in Anaheim on Sunday and denounced the killings.

“I’m disgusted and outraged,” said Hussam Ayloush, executive director at CAIR. “There is absolutely no justification for hate.”

Several leaders urged the public and media to not see the shooting a religiously-fueled event.

“This was not an act of Islam,” AJ Blackwood of the Progressive Interfaith Alliance said. “It was an act of terrorism and hate.”

CAIR’s Ayloush said local Muslims have received “an enormous number of threats” since the attack that left 14 dead in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, and he blamed politicians for “demonizing one group.”

“Now the American Muslim community joins that long list of other communities, African American, Jewish Americans, Latinos, immigrants and many others who become the target of such attacks by failed politicians,” Ayloush said.

Ayloush called for unity and solidarity rather than divisive rhetoric.

“If anyone, anyone tries to blame a community – in this case the Muslim community – in my opinion they are only fueling the insensitivity,” he said.

Authorities say the attack was possibly targeted at the LGBT community by a man who reportedly sympathized with ISIS.

“Personally I felt a little sick this morning,” said Laura Kanter, a director at the LGBT Center OC. “Whenever something like this happens it’s horrible, it’s awful, it’s terrifying.”

Kanter said the shooting in Orlando shook up many people in the local community. The center, which is in Santa Ana, had a wine and dessert fundraiser planned for Sunday afternoon.

“What we decided to do is open up that space for anyone who needs to talk or needs to be with their community or talk,” Kanter said.

Organizers also decided to send the funds raised to the victims of the shootings.","Local religious leaders condemned the shooting spree in an Orlando, Fla., nightclub that left 50 dead and 53 injured, but they also tried to distance the violence from Islam. Several leaders of dif…"

The FBI said the 29-year-old killer born in New York was an American citizen who legally purchased two firearms within the last week.

Despite being aware of Mateen since 2013, following inflammatory comments made to co-workers and over ties to an American suicide bomber in 2014, he was not under surveillance.

Authorities deemed his link to the bomber to be minimal so did not constitute a threat, and after interviews and an investigation dropped the probe into his comments.

It has been revealed that 911 calls involving the shooter from Port St Lucie, Florida and featuring conversations about the Islamic State before the massacre, have now become federal evidence.

US president Barack Obama called the killings at the gay-friendly establishment an ""act of terror"" and an ""act of hate"" and said they are being investigated as terrorism.

More than 300 people were inside the building at the time of the attack, which has now become the worst mass shooting in American history - 53 people have also been taken to hospital.

President Obama praised the emergency service response and described the gunman as a person ""filled with hatred"".

He said the massacre is a reminder of how easy it is for someone to access a weapon like a gun, allowing them to go on and shoot other people.

""We have to decide if that is the type of country we want to be. To actively to do nothing is a decision as well,"" Mr Obama added.

The first names of the victims have now been released by the police - Edward Sotomayor Jr, Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero are among the dead.

Mir Seddique, the father of the shooter, told NBC News that he thinks a recent experience in which his son saw two men kissing might be related to the shooting.

He apologised for the whole incident, said he was not aware of the actions of his security guard son and claimed ""this had nothing to do with religion"".

The killer, who also held hostages in a three-hour stand-off, later died in a gunfight with Swat officers in the Florida city. He exchanged gunfire with 14 officers at the club.

Mr Obama has also ordered flags at the White House and federal buildings to be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect for the victims.

And in the aftermath of the massacre, police departments across the US increased patrols around popular gay-friendly locations and venues.

Orlando mayor, Buddy Dyer, described the scene saying there was ""blood everywhere"".

Political leaders from around the world have since condemned the attack and offered their condolences to the victims.

Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani said ""targeting civilians is not justifiable under any circumstances whatsoever"", while Prime Minister David Cameron said he was ""horrified"" by the shooting.

French president Francois Hollande said he ""expresses the full support of France and the French with America's authorities and its people in this difficult time"".

And Buckingham Palace said the Queen had sent a personal message to Mr Obama on Sunday night, saying: ""Prince Philip and I have been shocked by the events in Orlando.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been affected.""","A gunman who massacred 50 people in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub was known to US authorities, it has been revealed."

Pride parade in West Hollywood.

James Wesley Howell, 20, of Indiana was arrested in Santa Monica, where police found three rifles, several high-capacity magazines loaded with ammunition, and chemicals that could be used for improvised explosives, Santa Monica police Lt. Saul Rodriguez said during a news conference.

Howell was arrested after police received a call at 4:59 a.m. of a suspicious man who was knocking on doors and windows. Rodriquez said Howell had no connection to the area, but when they found Howell, they also found his car, loaded with weapons.

“Our officer immediately noticed that there was a rifle in the seat of the car, which led to a further investigation, at which point, we recovered additional firearms and high-capacity magazines,” Rodriquez said.

Police later said they found a 5-gallon bucket with chemicals capable of forming an improvised explosive device. A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department alert listed the chemical as tannerite. Assault rifles as well as camouflage clothing were also found, according to the alert.

“The suspect did make an initial statement that he was going to go to the Pride festival,” Rodriguez said. “Beyond that he did not make additional statements saying he was going to do anything further than that. We do not have any additional information as to what his intentions were.”

A previous tweet issued by Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Saybrooks said Howell intended to harm many people at the gay pride event. Rodriquez called her tweet a “misstatement.”

According to Clark County, Indiana, court records, Howell had recently been convicted of intimidation in his home state in April and agreed to surrender his weapons.

The allegation was initially filed as a felony, along with a second count of pointing a firearm at another person, in October.

Under a plea agreement, Howell admitted the intimidation charge, and the charge of pointing a gun was dismissed, records show.

Howell was sentenced to one year in jail, but the jail term was suspended. He was placed on probation for at least one year and ordered to stay away from his victim.

“The defendant is to forfeit all weapons for all of probation period,” according to court records. It was unclear whether any weapons were ever surrendered or collected.

Howell’s white Acura sedan remained parked on the wrong side of 11th Street just south of Michigan Avenue with its doors open through Sunday afternoon. The sheriff’s bomb squad rendered the car safe later in the afternoon and the vehicle was towed from the neighborhood and the street reopened shortly after 3 p.m.

Howell was arrested for possession of weapons and explosive materials, and his bail was set at $500,000.

One witness on the scene, Heriberto Gomez, told reporters he saw Howell exit his Acura sedan, run across the street and hide in the bushes about 3 a.m.

“He stood there on the sidewalk near the bushes,” Gomez said. “He seen me and we stared at each other for a long minute, and he got a little shooken that I was watching him.”

Santa Monica Mayor Tony Vazquez praised the work of his city’s police department.

“On behalf of the city, we’re disappointed to hear what happened in Orlando but also wanted to thank the neighbors who did come out and report this incident,” Vazquez said.

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the agency is assisting the Santa Monica Police Department with the investigation.

But any relation to the deadly shooting in Orlando was unclear, law enforcement officials said throughout the day.

“Any possible nexus with this individual and the Pride event in West Hollywood is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” according to the Los Angeles County sheriff’s department, which was helping out in the investigation.

More than 2,000 miles away, the FBI was investigating the fatal shooting of 50 people inside an Orlando club called Pulse. Another 53 people were reportedly injured. The gunman was identified as Omar Saddiqui Mateen, 29.

Mateen had reportedly called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, before he headed for the nightclub. He was killed in a gunfight with police.

Because of that shooting, security remained high around Sunday’s festival in West Hollywood, though there were no specific or credible threats received by law enforcement, according to a statement by the Sheriff’s Department.

The parade, part of a two-day annual festival in West Hollywood where 400,000 people were expected, went on as scheduled.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told the crowd before the start of the parade that while the festival was going forward, it was a difficult time. He said nothing should stop people from all races and backgrounds from celebrating together.

“We did not want to be here under these circumstances,” Garcetti said. “We’re here as Angelenos, as the LGBTQ community and allies, to say as Americans we will not shrink away, we will not be sullen in our homes, we will not go back in the closets. We are here to march, to celebrate and to mourn.”

Family members, some wrapped in blankets and many of them in tears, were guided into the building where some of the survivors of the attack were taken earlier in the day and where volunteers awaited with cold water and food. There were also chaplains and psychotherapists on hand.

By late afternoon Sunday, authorities had only released the names of six victims: Edward Sotomayor Jr, 34; Stanley Almodovar III, 23; Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20; Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22; Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36; and Peter O Gonzalez-Cruz, 22.

Sotomayor was a brand manager at a travel agency that specialized in vacations for the gay community, and company owner Al Ferguson wrote on Facebook that he was with the victim’s family at the hospital. “One of the saddest days of my life,” he wrote, adding that he felt “empty”.

Almodovar lived in Clermont, Florida, and worked as a pharmacist, writing on Instagram: “pharmacy is my talent, drug life chose me.”

Most other families and friends waited in fear for news.

“When you get sent from the hospital to a hotel it has you fearing the worst,” said Barron Cerrano, whose 37-year-old brother Juan Rivera is among the missing.

“Nobody knows anything for sure and there’s so much wrong information circulating on social media. I’ve not lost faith or hope. We believe in God and we will keep praying and asking for prayers.”

Rivera, he said, is a respected and well-known hair stylist in Orlando who regularly works with the local Telemundo news affiliate TV station. He was at Pulse celebrating a friend’s birthday and goes to the club’s Latin nights “once or twice a month”, Cerrano said.

“I would usually go myself but for some reason last night I chose not to,” he said. “It’s a popular place with a lot of latino people.”

Tamara Colon left Pulse about 10 minutes before the shooting took place and learned the full horror of what had happened when friends who were trapped inside started to send her text messages.

She said she knew “three or four” friends who were likely killed, knew another 15 or so who were unaccounted for. “The club was so busy, maybe 300 or more people, and everyone was dancing and having a good time and being nice to each other,” she said.

“On any other night I’d still have been there at 2.30am but this night we left early. Friends who were in there said how horrific it was. It breaks my heart.”

Colon’s friend, Andrew Aleman, 23, who left the club early with her, broke down in tears as he recounted friends’ stories of the scene inside, including blood over the floors and bodies seemingly everywhere.

“I have friends who have passed, friends in hospital and friends who are missing,” he said. “My feelings right now are numb. I’m keeping calm and trying to keep the pain out but when I let go I know it’s going to be very hard for me, it’s going to be bad. I’m still trying to process it.”

Katherine Rosales suspected her cousin Jose Martinez, 24, had become a victim when the Mexican restaurant he works at in Altamonte called to say he had not turned up for work on Sunday morning.

“He’s a hard worker, six days a week, he enjoys his job and wouldn’t just not turn up to work,” Rosales said.”He’s never missed a day.

“He’d let somebody know what had happened to him if he was able. If he’s lying critically ill in hospital and nobody knows who he is, that’s still better than the alternative.”

Rosales said her cousin enjoys dancing every weekend and thought nothing of driving miles to downtown Orlando to go to Pulse. “It’s his life,” she added.

Tragic news also seeped through the police cordon in South Orange Avenue, where officers kept the public back about 200 metres from the Pulse nightclub.

Three women, regular Pulse visitors who by a quirk were not there last night, learnt via text message that one of their close friends did not survive the massacre. “They didn’t make it, they didn’t make it,” the women said.

Amy, 28, Xiomara and Janice Rivera, both 24, are visibly distraught. But above all they are angry. Angry that their community was picked on for no reason. Angry that while they wish nobody else any harm, they have themselves become targets. Angry that once again they will have to be looking behind their backs in case of another attack.

“There were never any problems in Pulse,” Amy said. “It was never dangerous. Gay people don’t care what straight people do in their beds, so why does it matter in ours.”

“This was the first club I’d ever been to where we were welcomed. Everybody would dance with each other – straight, bixexual, trans, anything. It doesn’t matter who you were, everyone will love you in there,” said Rivera.

Xiomara said that “now we have to go in fear. We have to hope this doesn’t happen to us again. We aren’t bad human beings, we just love our own sex. So why so much hatred?”

There was little information about the other victims of the deadliest shooting in American history as authorities worked to identify those whose bodies remained in the nightclub into Sunday afternoon.



Nearly 12 hours after the shooting began, the White House waived certain parts of the national health privacy rule so the hospital could speak with family members. Longtime Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer said he had contacted the White House to request the change. He said all victims in the hospital had been identified.

At Orlando police headquarters, Maria Arocha, 17, told the Guardian her cousin Martin Torres, 33, went to the club with his husband Michael Morales but had not been heard from since.

Morales escaped with a bullet wound to his knee and was recovering in the Orlando regional medical center. But of Torres, Arocha said, there was no word.

“We’re just hoping and praying,” Arocha said. “We’ve been to the hospital trying to find out anything we can, but nobody knows anything. Michael is OK but we’re worried about Martin, of course.”

Torres was at the club celebrating and had been looking forward to a night out with his husband, excitedly posting about it in a Facebook post, Arocha said. He was not a regular at Pulse, she added.

Brian Vieoma has been texting and calling his brother Luis’s mobile phone since his family learned this morning about the Pulse shooting. He had no reply and now feared the worst.

“He came over for Latin Night, Venezuelans love to go dancing,” Vieoma said of his 22-year-old brother.

“We know he was at the club with a female friend, could be a girlfriend, could be a friend, but we don’t know, and we haven’t heard from him. There’s been no answer on his phone.”

Luis Vieoma, who works at Universal Studios’ theme park, was visiting the club from Sanford, a city north of Orlando. His father went to the Orlando Regional Medical Center to search for his son while Brian looked for information at a victim support center set up at a nearby hotel.

“My mom is out of the country and it’ll be hard for her,” said Brian, 19. “We’re just praying.”

Witnesses described being in the club when they heard bangs that sounded like music only to realize it was gunfire as they and people close to them were splattered with blood. Police and citizens said they received calls and texts from people inside the club asking for help.

Mina Justice told the Associated Press that her 30-year-old son, Eddie, had been in the club when the attack took place. She said he texted her to ask that she call the police, then sent a message that said “he’s coming”.

His next text said: “He has us, and he’s in here with us,” she said. “That was the last conversation.”

Police directed relatives to a crisis hotline for more information. Facebook activated its Safety Check feature so those in the area could broadcast that they were safe to their family and friends. People also used social media to seek information about their missing friends and family.

Christine Leinonen cried as she told ABC News that she had been outside the hospital since 4am waiting to hear what had happened to her son, Christopher, who had been at Pulse with his friends.

“They said there’s a lot of dead bodies in the club and that it’s a crime scene ... so it could be hours and hours before we find out,” Leinonen said.

She said her son’s friend, Brandon, told her he did not know where her son was but had seen Christopher’s boyfriend taken by ambulance from the club with multiple gunshot wounds.

Leinonen said: “I left him with ‘I love you’.”",Authorities release first names of victims as White House waives certain privacy measures to allow hospital to speak with family members

""We know enough to say this is an act of terror and an act of hate,"" he said. ""As Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and resolve to defend our people.""

""The FBI is investigating this as an act of terror,"" he added. ""What is clear is that he is a person is full of hatred.""

The President also recognized the first responders to the shooting.

""We also express our profound gratitude to all of our police and first responders who rushed into harms way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives. It's the kind of sacrifice that law enforcement professional make for us every single day for all of us, and we can't thank them enough.""

Obama also addressed the LGBT community, as the attacks occurred at a gay nightclub during Pride Month.

""The place where they were attacked was more than a nightclub, it was a place of solidarity,"" he said. ""This is a sobering reminder, that attacks on any American regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation is an attack on all of us.""

Finally, Obama also addressed gun control laws and access to firearms.

""The shooter was armed a handgun and a poweful assault rifle. This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that allows them to shoot people at a school, or a house of worship, or at a movie theater or at a nightclub.""

Obama’s comments come hours after Omar Mateen entered a nightclub in Orlando, Florida and opened fire, killing at least 50 people and injuring more than 50 more.

This isn’t the first time Obama has spoken to the nation following a mass shooting. He most recently spoke following a mass shooting by a radicalized couple in San Bernardino, California. He also spoke to the nation following shootings in Sandy Hook, Connecticut; Aurora, Colorado and in Fort Hood, Texas. He also famously shed tears while addressing the nation following a school shooting in Roseburg, Oregon.

Several leaders of different faiths and the LGBT community gathered at the offices of Council on American-Islamic Relations in Anaheim on Sunday and denounced the killings.

“I’m disgusted and outraged,” said Hussam Ayloush, executive director at CAIR. “There is absolutely no justification for hate.”

Several leaders urged the public and media to not see the shooting a religiously-fueled event.

“This was not an act of Islam,” AJ Blackwood of the Progressive Interfaith Alliance said. “It was an act of terrorism and hate.”

CAIR’s Ayloush said local Muslims have received “an enormous number of threats” since the attack that left 14 dead in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, and he blamed politicians for “demonizing one group.”

“Now the American Muslim community joins that long list of other communities, African American, Jewish Americans, Latinos, immigrants and many others who become the target of such attacks by failed politicians,” Ayloush said.

Ayloush called for unity and solidarity rather than divisive rhetoric.

“If anyone, anyone tries to blame a community – in this case the Muslim community – in my opinion they are only fueling the insensitivity,” he said.

Authorities say the attack was possibly targeted at the LGBT community by a man who reportedly sympathized with ISIS.

“Personally I felt a little sick this morning,” said Laura Kanter, a director at the LGBT Center OC. “Whenever something like this happens it’s horrible, it’s awful, it’s terrifying.”

Kanter said the shooting in Orlando shook up many people in the local community. The center, which is in Santa Ana, had a wine and dessert fundraiser planned for Sunday afternoon.

“What we decided to do is open up that space for anyone who needs to talk or needs to be with their community or talk,” Kanter said.

Organizers also decided to send the funds raised to the victims of the shootings.","Local religious leaders condemned the shooting spree in an Orlando, Fla., nightclub that left 50 dead and 53 injured, but they also tried to distance the violence from Islam. Several leaders of dif…"

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!,” tweeted Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslims from entering the US and the destruction of ISIS.

Trump took credit as law enforcement indicated shooter, 29-year-old Omar Mateen, had been on the FBI’s radar as an ISIS sympathizer. He opened fire around 2 a.m. Sunday at Pulse nightclub, an LGBT hot spot, in a rampage that killed 50 and injured at least 50 more.

The mogul first announced a “really bad shooting in Orlando” that police are investigating for “possible terrorism.” But when the police identified the murder as terrorism, his tweets grew more intense.

“Horrific incident in FL,” Trump tweeted in the afternoon “Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?”

Meanwhile, President Obama is slated to address the nation at 1:30 pm today following the deadliest mass shooting in US history. Vice President Biden canceled his trip to Miami to fundraise for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and instead will return to Washington.

Top Trump surrogate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) called for tougher screenings of Muslims coming into the United States.

“It certainly looks like another one of the extremist attacks, Islamic extremism,” Sessions (R-Ala.) told Fox News Sunday.

Sessions said the rampage will mean “further movement in the direction Donald Trump has set forth.”

“It’s not stopping, as we see apparently today,” Sessions said. “More of these attacks are coming. It’s a real part of the threat that we face. … We need to slow down and be careful about those we admit into the country.”

Democrats, include Bernie Sanders, quickly called for stricter gun control after police said Mateen use an AR-15 rifle and a handgun in the murder spree.

“He had an AR-15, an assault weapon,” New York Sen. Charles Schumer said Sunday. “It is very easy to get these kinds of guns in Florida. … But whatever happened, we have to get tougher on guns. We can’t have incident after incident after incident after incident. And in this country it is so easy for so many people to get these kinds of assault weapons whose only purpose is to shoot a whole lot of people.”

For her part, Hillary Clinton didn’t tackle gun control from the start.

“Woke up to hear the devastating news from FL. As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act,” the presumptive Democratic nominee tweeted.

Sanders called for an assault weapons ban. “We should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people,” the Democratic presidential candidate told “Meet the Press.”

“We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them, criminals, people who are mentally ill. So that struggles continues.”","WASHINGTON — In the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Donald Trump took to Twitter Sunday to say he was “right” about warning about the danger of radical Islamic extremists &#…"

Fifty people were shot to death and 53 injured when a gunman, identified as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, opened fire at the Pulse nightclub, a popular venue for LGBT people.

But though the rules on blood donations by gay men have been eased, those who have been sexually active in the last year still are banned from donating blood.

The ban on donations goes back three decades to the height of the HIV/AIDS outbreak. The Food and Drug Administration imposed a lifetime ban on donations from homosexual and bisexual men in 1983 when little was known about the spread of the disease, and numerous cases of infection acquired through blood transfusions were reported.

In 2006, the American Association of Blood Banks, America’s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross issued a joint statement saying the lifetime ban was no longer warranted and urged a change in policy. That did not happen until last December, when the FDA said it would allow donations 12 months after an individual’s last sexual contact.

“Ultimately, the 12-month deferral window is supported by the best available scientific evidence, at this point in time, relevant to the U.S. population,” Dr. Peter Marks, deputy director of the FDA's biologics division, said in a statement.

The decision brought the United States in line with other countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

But the change in policy still does not please everyone.

“It is ridiculous and counter to the public health that a married gay man in a monogamous relationship can’t give blood, but a promiscuous straight man who has had hundreds of opposite sex partners in the last year can,” Jared Polis, a Democratic congressman and co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, a caucus of openly gay members of Congress, told Reuters in December.

“It perpetuates the stigma that HIV is a gay disease,” Kelsey Louie, who heads Gay Men's Health Crisis, an advocacy group, told NPR.

Potential exposure to HIV/AIDS is not the only disease that keeps people from donating blood. Those exposed to diseases like hepatitis and malaria are prohibited from blood donations for at least a year, as well as those who have been diagnosed with various cancers. More recently, concerns have been raised over those who were exposed to Zika virus.","Though FDA rules on blood donations have been eased, sexually active gay and bisexual gay men still can’t donate following Sunday’s Orlando nightclub shooting."

Mateen, who killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last night, had already been ”on the radar” of US officials, and reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIL, a.k.a. the Islamic State, in a 911 call just before the attack.

Mateen had twice been identified as a “person of interest to authorities,” a senior law enforcement source told The Daily Beast. He came to the FBI’s attention in 2013 and again in 2014, though the source didn’t specify why. The FBI opened an investigation into Mateen but couldn’t find anything requiring further work, and so closed the case, according to The Daily Beast source. In a conflicting account, law enforcement officials told ABC News that Mateen was “on the radar” of officials, but not subject to a specific investigation.

Before carrying out the attack, Mateen called 911 in Florida and swore his allegiance to the head of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to NBC News, which cited law-enforcement sources. A US congressman, Adam Schiff, told CNN he had been given the same information by intelligence officials.

Mateen was born in New York in 1986 to Afghan parents and was once married to a woman from New Jersey. His former wife told The Washington Post that Mateen was violent, mentally unstable, and often beat her. “He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that,” she said. The couple were married in March 2009 and formally divorced in 2011.

The 29-year-old worked as a professional security officer, and had a gun license to carry a firearm. He lived in Port St. Lucie, Florida, a two-hour drive from Orlando, and rented a car to drive there and carry out the attack.

Aside from the report about Mateen’s ISIL ties, the exact motives behind his attack remain unclear, and it is also unclear whether he collaborated with anyone. So far, the authorities have not released any answers. Florida Democrat senator Bill Nelson has said information from intelligence sources suggest “a link to Islamic radicalism… some kind of connection to ISIS,” a.k.a ISIL. However, Florida congressman Alan Grayson said there was currently no evidence that Mateen had outside help.

One possibility is that Mateen was a lone wolf inspired by radical Islam but not working directly with any terrorist groups. The Islamic State recently called on followers to attack the United States and Europe during the holy month of Ramadan, which began June 5.

Mir Seddique, Mateen’s father told NBC News that ”this had nothing to do with religion.” He said it might have been because Mateen had seen two men kissing in Miami a couple of months earlier in front of his wife and son, and became angry.","Omar S.

While the investigation into the mass shooting is still early, authorities have established that suspect Omar Mateen may have been inspired by the Islamic extremist terror organization ISIS, while his father told NBC News he believes the attack was motivated by homophobia.

A transcript of the president's remarks follow below:

Today as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder, horrific massacre, of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando who have endured a terrible attack on their city.

Although it's still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate. And as Americans, we are united in grief, in outrage, and in resolve to defend our people.

I just finished a meeting with FBI Director Comey and my Homeland and National Security Advisors. The FBI is on the scene and leading the investigation in partner with local law enforcement. I've directed that the full resources of the federal government be made available for this investigation.

We are still learning all the facts. This is an open investigation. We've reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer. The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism, and I've directed that we must spare no effort to determine what, if any, inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups.

What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we'll uncover how and why this happened, and we'll go wherever the facts lead us.

This morning I spoke with my good friend, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, and I conveyed to them the deepest condolences of the American people. This could have been any one of our communities. So I told Mayor Dyer whatever help he and the people of Orlando need, they are going to get it. As a country, we'll be there for the people of Orlando today and for all the days to come.

We also express our profound gratitude to all the police and first responders who rushed to harm's way. Their courage and professionalism saved lives and kept the carnage from being even worse. That's the kind of sacrifice our law enforcement professionals make every single day for all of us, and we can never thank them enough.

This is an especially heartbreaking day for all of our friends and fellow Americans who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance, and to sing, and to live. The place where they were attacked was more than a nightclub. It's a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds and to advocate for their civil rights.

This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country. No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.

Today marks the most deadly shooting in American history. The shooter was apparently armed with a handgun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is, therefore, a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that's the kind of country we want to be, and to actively do nothing is a decision as well.

In the coming hours and days we'll learn about the victims of this tragedy — their names, their faces, who they were, the joy that they brought to families and to friends and the difference that they made in this world. Say a prayer for them. Say a prayer for their families. Let God give them the strength to bear the unbearable, that he give us all the strength to be there for them and the strength and courage to change. We need to demonstrate that we are defined more as a country by the way they live their lives than by the hate of the man who took them from us.

As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts — friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other.

Mateen, who killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last night, had already been ”on the radar” of US officials, and reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIL, a.k.a. the Islamic State, in a 911 call just before the attack.

Mateen had twice been identified as a “person of interest to authorities,” a senior law enforcement source told The Daily Beast. He came to the FBI’s attention in 2013 and again in 2014, though the source didn’t specify why. The FBI opened an investigation into Mateen but couldn’t find anything requiring further work, and so closed the case, according to The Daily Beast source. In a conflicting account, law enforcement officials told ABC News that Mateen was “on the radar” of officials, but not subject to a specific investigation.

Before carrying out the attack, Mateen called 911 in Florida and swore his allegiance to the head of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to NBC News, which cited law-enforcement sources. A US congressman, Adam Schiff, told CNN he had been given the same information by intelligence officials.

Mateen was born in New York in 1986 to Afghan parents and was once married to a woman from New Jersey. His former wife told The Washington Post that Mateen was violent, mentally unstable, and often beat her. “He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that,” she said. The couple were married in March 2009 and formally divorced in 2011.

The 29-year-old worked as a professional security officer, and had a gun license to carry a firearm. He lived in Port St. Lucie, Florida, a two-hour drive from Orlando, and rented a car to drive there and carry out the attack.

Aside from the report about Mateen’s ISIL ties, the exact motives behind his attack remain unclear, and it is also unclear whether he collaborated with anyone. So far, the authorities have not released any answers. Florida Democrat senator Bill Nelson has said information from intelligence sources suggest “a link to Islamic radicalism… some kind of connection to ISIS,” a.k.a ISIL. However, Florida congressman Alan Grayson said there was currently no evidence that Mateen had outside help.

One possibility is that Mateen was a lone wolf inspired by radical Islam but not working directly with any terrorist groups. The Islamic State recently called on followers to attack the United States and Europe during the holy month of Ramadan, which began June 5.

Mir Seddique, Mateen’s father told NBC News that ”this had nothing to do with religion.” He said it might have been because Mateen had seen two men kissing in Miami a couple of months earlier in front of his wife and son, and became angry.","Omar S.

At least six separate donation sites are seeking blood in the wake of the attack, reported the Guardian.

Authorities are currently investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism. Alleged gunman Omar Mateen's father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News the crime may have been motivated by his son's hatred of gay people.

The lives taken on Sunday can never be replaced. But as several Twitter users noted, it's heartening to see so many Floridians and others lining up to help.

The attack left about 50 people dead and more than 50 others wounded.

Authorities were investigating it as an act of terrorism.

The suspect exchanged gunfire with an officer working at the gay club known as Pulse Orlando around 2 a.m., when more than 300 people were inside. The gunman then went back inside and took hostages, Police Chief John Mina said.

Around 5 a.m., authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the hostages.

In addition to the guns, the shooter also had some sort of ""suspicious device,"" Mina said.

Authorities were looking into whether the attack was an act of domestic or international terror, and if the shooter acted alone, according to Danny Banks, an agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

""This is an incident, as I see it, that we certainly classify as domestic terror incident,"" Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.

FBI agent Ron Hopper said there was no further threat to Orlando or the surrounding area.

When asked if the gunman had a connection to radical Islamic terrorism, Hopper said authorities had ""suggestions that individual has leanings towards that.""

Several news organizations identified the gunman as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida.

Police had said previously on Twitter that there was a ""controlled explosion"" at the scene of the shooting. Mina said that noise was caused by a device intended to distract the shooter.

A woman who was outside the dance club early Sunday was trying to contact her 30-year-old son, Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: ""He's coming.""

""The next text said: 'He has us, and he's in here with us,'"" Mina Justice said. ""That was the last conversation.""

Dozens of police vehicles swarmed the area around the club. At least two police pickup trucks were seen taking what appeared to be shooting victims to the Orlando Regional Medical Center.

Pulse posted on its own Facebook page around 2 a.m.: ""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running."" Just before 6 a.m., the club posted an update: ""As soon as we have any information, we will update everyone. Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event. Thank you for your thoughts and love.""

Local, state and federal agencies were investigating. (Associated Press)","Authorities were looking into whether the attack was an act of domestic or international terror, and if the shooter acted alone."

Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar said killing of homosexuals is the “compassionate” thing to do: “Death is the sentence. We know there’s nothing to be embarrassed about this, death is the sentence.”

Sheikh Sekaleshfar’s call for the death of all homosexuals is based on the tenets of Islam. He is viewed as an expert on Shariah Islamiyya or Islamic Law.

At the time of his talk, WFTV 9 Orlando tried to find out why the mosque invited Dr. Sekaleshfar to speak in the first place.

Reporter Field Sutton stated, “Off camera, one of the people who is a member here told me that Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar’s speech last night on women’s issues was well-received, and not particularly controversial. But we already know that many people in the Sanford area and around central Florida are upset about what is coming tonight.”

Seminole County resident Alan Kornman said, “It’s appalling. It’s inciting violence against gays, and I find that reprehensible.”

Dr. Farrokh Sekaleshfar admits the Islamic death sentence applies in limited circumstances and is not applicable under U.S. law. But he also says the only way gays and lesbians can be forgiven is to die.

“We have to have that compassion for people, with homosexuals, it’s the same,” said Dr. Sekaleshfar. “Out of compassion, let’s get rid of them now.”

A police officer working as a security guard inside the Pulse nightclub, which has operated in downtown Orlando since 2004 and was hosting some 350 revelers, exchanged fire with the suspect at about 2 a.m. ET, police officials said.

""Everyone get out of pulse and keep running,"" the club's management wrote on Facebook as the incident unfolded.

It was the deadliest mass shooting in American history.

Authorities were investigating the attack on the Florida dance hall as an act of terrorism. The gunman's father recalled that his son recently got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami and said that might be related to the assault.

At least 53 people were hospitalized, most in critical condition, officials said. A surgeon at Orlando Regional Medical Center said the death toll was likely to climb.

Mayor Buddy Dyer said all of the dead were killed with the assault rifle. ""There's blood everywhere,"" Dyer said.

Witnesses described a chaotic scene when the gunfire began shortly before the club known as Pulse was to close. ""Some guy walked in and started shooting everybody. He had an automatic rifle, so nobody stood a chance,"" said Jackie Smith, who had two friends next to her get shot. ""I just tried to get out of there.""

The suspect exchanged gunfire with a police officer working at the club, which had more than 300 people inside. The gunman then went back inside and took hostages, Police Chief John Mina said. Around 5am, authorities sent in a SWAT team to rescue the hostages.

The previous deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. was the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech, where a student killed 32 people before killing himself. The suspect in the Orlando attack was identified as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida.

Rep. Alan Grayson named the shooter, citing law enforcement officials. A federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation also confirmed the name. The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Mateen's father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News about his son seeing the men kissing a couple of months ago.

""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident,"" Seddique said. ""We are in shock like the whole country.""

FBI agent Ron Hopper said there was no further threat to Orlando or the surrounding area.

When asked if the gunman had a connection to radical Islamic terrorism, Hopper said authorities had ""suggestions that individual has leanings towards that."" Mateen's father said the attack had nothing to do with religion, he said.

In addition to the guns, the shooter also had some sort of ""suspicious device,"" the police chief said. Authorities said they had secured the suspect's vehicle, a van, outside the club.

A SWAT truck and a bomb-disposal unit were on the scene of an address associated with Mateen in a residential neighborhood of Fort Pierce, Florida, about 118 miles southeast of Orlando.

Relatives and friends, many in tears, gathered outside the hospital to learn the fate of loved ones. Smith did not know the conditions of her friends and came out of the hospital and burst into tears.

Christine Leinonen drove to Orlando at 4 a.m. after learning of the shooting from a friend of her 32-year-old son, Christopher Leinonen, who was at Pulse and is missing.

She has not heard from her son and fears the worse. ""These are nonsensical killings of our children,"" she said, sobbing. ""They're killing our babies!""

She said her son's friend Brandon Wolf survived by hiding in a bathroom and running out as the bullets flew.

A woman who was outside the club early Sunday was trying to contact her 30-year-old son, Eddie, who texted her when the shooting happened and asked her to call police. He told her he ran into a bathroom with other club patrons to hide. He then texted her: ""He's coming.""

President Barack Obama was briefed on the attack and asked for regular updates on the investigation, the White House said.

Jon Alamo said he was at the back of one of the club's rooms when a man holding a weapon came into the front of the room.

Club-goer Rob Rick said the shooting started just as ""everybody was drinking their last sip.""

He estimated more than 100 people were still inside when he heard shots, got on the ground and crawled toward a DJ booth. A bouncer knocked down a partition between the club area and an area where only workers are allowed. People inside were then able to escape through the back of the club.

Christopher Hansen said he was in the VIP lounge when he heard gunshots. He continued to hear shooting even after he emerged and saw the wounded being tended across the street.

""I was thinking, 'Are you kidding me?' So I just dropped down. I just said, 'Please, please, please, I want to make it out,'"" he said. ""And when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood. You hope and pray you don't get shot.""",53 injured; authorities are investigating as an act of terrorism; death toll expected to climb.

""Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows,"" read the Bible verse Patrick sent out on his official Twitter account a few hours after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 50 dead.

His office was not immediately available for comment but has told local media, including the Dallas Morning News, that the tweet had been scheduled for release well before the shooting. The office, which regularly sends out a Bible verse on Sundays, has since deleted it and replaced with another passage, they said.

But the deleted tweet from a politician who has condemned same-sex marriage and fought against LGBT rights still raised the ire of those who accused Patrick of blaming the victims.

""You are a disgrace to your state in this time of national sorrow. You should resign,"" prominent LGBT activist George Takei wrote on Twitter.

The Texas Democratic Party called on Patrick to apologize immediately.

""Make this right. We are better than this,"" it said in a statement.

Patrick is currently out of the country and has not yet made comment to media about the tweet.

The new verse sent on his account reads: ""The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord; He is their stronghold in time of trouble.""","The office of Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a Republican and evangelical Christian, on Sunday deleted a tweet many saw as offensive and insensitive that was sent out shortly after the deadly attack on a gay nightclub in Florida.""Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.

On Sunday, as the country began to process and react to the nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida, the president offered the latest entry in what has become an unfathomably large canon of speeches and statements about mass murder. “We as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder, horrific massacre, of dozens of innocent people,” Obama said. “We pray for their families who are grasping for answers with broken hearts. We stand with the people of Orlando who have endured a terrible attack on their city.” 



Soon, this brief speech will take its place in the history alongside all the others; while it’s still fresh, it’s worth looking back at the opening lines of 15 others that will keep it company.

1. “Michelle and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn about the act of senseless violence in Binghamton, New York, today.” (April 3, 2009)

2. “I had planned to make some broader remarks about the challenges that lay ahead for Native Americans, as well as collaboration with our administration, but as some of you might have heard, there has been a tragic shooting at the Fort Hood Army base in Texas. We don’t yet know all the details at this moment; we will share them as we get them. What we do know is that a number of American soldiers have been killed and even more have been wounded in a horrific outburst of violence.” (Nov. 5, 2009)

3. “As many of you are aware, earlier today a number of people were shot in Tucson, Arizona, including several who were meeting at a supermarket with their congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords. We are still assembling all the facts, but we know that Representative Giffords was one of the victims. She is currently at a hospital in the area, and she is battling for her life.” (Jan. 8, 2011)

4. “I know many of you came here today for a campaign event. I was looking forward to having a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as a country and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election. But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that we are united as one American family. … By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver in a town called Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater, and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victims are being treated at a children’s hospital.” (July 20, 2012)

5. “Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin. At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded.” (Aug. 5, 2012)

6. “We’ve endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news I react not as a president, but as anybody else would—as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there’s not a parent in America who doesn’t feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. The majority of those who died today were children—beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them—birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers—men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today—for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost.” (Dec. 14, 2012)

7. “Before I begin, let me say a few words about the tragedy that’s unfolding not far away from here, at the Washington Navy Yard. That’s part of why our event today was delayed. I’ve been briefed by my team on the situation. We still don’t know all the facts. But we do know that several people have been shot, and some have been killed. So we are confronting yet another mass shooting. And today it happened on a military installation in our nation’s capital. It’s a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel. These are men and women who were going to work, doing their job protecting all of us. They’re patriots. And they know the dangers of serving abroad, but today they faced the unimaginable violence that they wouldn’t have expected here at home.” (Sept. 16, 2013)

8. “Hello, everybody. I just got off the phone with Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Sandy Winnefeld to get the latest report on the situation in Fort Hood. Obviously, we’re following it closely. The situation is fluid right now. But my national security team is in close contact with not just the Defense Department but the FBI. They are working with folks on the ground to determine exactly what happened to make sure that everybody is secure. And I want to just assure all of us that we’re going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened. Any shooting is troubling. Obviously this reopens the pain of what happened at Fort Hood five years ago.” (April 2, 2014)

9. “As I was preparing my remarks, something intervened yesterday. And so I want to just devote a few words about yesterday’s tragedy in Kansas. This morning our prayers are with the people of Overland Park. And we’re still learning the details, but this much we know. A gunman opened fire at two Jewish facilities—a community center and a retirement home. Innocent people were killed. Their families were devastated. And this violence has struck the heart of the Jewish community in Kansas City.” (April 14, 2014)



10. “We’re the only developed country on Earth where this happens. … And it happens now once a week. And it’s a one-day story. There’s no place else like this.” (June 10, 2014)

11. “Yesterday, the FBI opened an inquiry into the brutal and outrageous murders of Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In addition to the ongoing investigation by local authorities, the FBI is taking steps to determine whether federal laws were violated. No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship. Michelle and I offer our condolences to the victims’ loved ones.” (Feb. 13, 2015)



12. “Good afternoon, everybody. This morning, I spoke with, and Vice President Biden spoke with, Mayor Joe Riley and other leaders of Charleston to express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders that took place last night. Michelle and I know several members of Emanuel AME Church. We knew their pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who, along with eight others, gathered in prayer and fellowship and was murdered last night. And to say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, and their community doesn’t say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel. Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship.” (June 18, 2015)

13. “I just received a briefing from FBI Director Comey, as well as my White House team, about the tragic shooting that took place in Chattanooga today. We don’t know yet all the details. We know that what appears to be a lone gunman carried out these attacks. We’ve identified a name. And at this point, a full investigation is taking place. The FBI will be in the lead, working closely with local law enforcement.” (July 16, 2015)

14. “There’s been another mass shooting in America—this time, in a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families—moms, dads, children—whose lives have been changed forever. That means there’s another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.” (Oct. 1, 2015) 



15. “Yesterday, a tragedy occurred in San Bernardino, and as I said in the immediate aftermath, our first order of business is to send our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who have been killed and to pray for a speedy recovery for those who were injured during this terrible attack.

The FBI said the 29-year-old killer born in New York was an American citizen who legally purchased two firearms within the last week.

Despite being aware of Mateen since 2013, following inflammatory comments made to co-workers and over ties to an American suicide bomber in 2014, he was not under surveillance.

Authorities deemed his link to the bomber to be minimal so did not constitute a threat, and after interviews and an investigation dropped the probe into his comments.

It has been revealed that 911 calls involving the shooter from Port St Lucie, Florida and featuring conversations about the Islamic State before the massacre, have now become federal evidence.

US president Barack Obama called the killings at the gay-friendly establishment an ""act of terror"" and an ""act of hate"" and said they are being investigated as terrorism.

More than 300 people were inside the building at the time of the attack, which has now become the worst mass shooting in American history - 53 people have also been taken to hospital.

President Obama praised the emergency service response and described the gunman as a person ""filled with hatred"".

He said the massacre is a reminder of how easy it is for someone to access a weapon like a gun, allowing them to go on and shoot other people.

""We have to decide if that is the type of country we want to be. To actively to do nothing is a decision as well,"" Mr Obama added.

The first names of the victims have now been released by the police - Edward Sotomayor Jr, Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero are among the dead.

Mir Seddique, the father of the shooter, told NBC News that he thinks a recent experience in which his son saw two men kissing might be related to the shooting.

He apologised for the whole incident, said he was not aware of the actions of his security guard son and claimed ""this had nothing to do with religion"".

The killer, who also held hostages in a three-hour stand-off, later died in a gunfight with Swat officers in the Florida city. He exchanged gunfire with 14 officers at the club.

Mr Obama has also ordered flags at the White House and federal buildings to be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect for the victims.

And in the aftermath of the massacre, police departments across the US increased patrols around popular gay-friendly locations and venues.

Orlando mayor, Buddy Dyer, described the scene saying there was ""blood everywhere"".

Political leaders from around the world have since condemned the attack and offered their condolences to the victims.

Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani said ""targeting civilians is not justifiable under any circumstances whatsoever"", while Prime Minister David Cameron said he was ""horrified"" by the shooting.

French president Francois Hollande said he ""expresses the full support of France and the French with America's authorities and its people in this difficult time"".

And Buckingham Palace said the Queen had sent a personal message to Mr Obama on Sunday night, saying: ""Prince Philip and I have been shocked by the events in Orlando.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been affected.""","A gunman who massacred 50 people in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub was known to US authorities, it has been revealed."

Early this morning, in an act of unimaginable savagery, the lives of at least fifty innocent men and women were cruelly snuffed out in a mass shooting at an Orlando, Florida nightclub.

Regardless of the gunman's precise motive, which is still not known with certainty at this hour, this was clearly yet another unfathomable act of evil, of hate, perpetrated against good and decent people who loved their lives and did nothing wrong. Their loss, and the loss their friends and loved ones must now somehow endure, is simply incomprehensible -- and heartbreaking.

Earlier today, I spoke with our own police chief, Greg Mullen, who reports that he is in contact with state and federal officials, and that all appropriate actions are being taken here locally to secure our citizens against a similar tragedy. In addition, I have placed a call to Mayor Dyer in Orlando to offer whatever assistance we can to those now responding to this horrific event.

One year ago this week, we here in Charleston were brought face to face with the same kind of evil that the people of Orlando are being forced to reckon with today, when nine beautiful souls were viciously stolen from us by a racist gunman in the basement of Mother Emanuel AME church.

We will never forget the horror of that hot, sticky June night, or of the terrible days and weeks that followed. We will never understand the evil that drove a young man, born and raised here in our state, to carry out that unimaginable crime. And we will never stop giving thanks for the remarkable courage and grace of the Mother Emanuel families, who looked beyond their own pain to show us the way to hope and reconciliation -- and in the process, did so much to help lift our city through those terrible times.

The thoughts and prayers of all Charlestonians are with the people of Orlando today, as we grieve for the lost and for those they left behind. And as we remain determined to live out the full meaning of St. Paul's admonition that we ""be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.""","Today, Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg released the following statement, on the horrific mass shooting in Orlando, Florida:"

Orlando Police Chief John Mina has described the massacre as one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history.

Investigators are calling the shooting a domestic act of terrorism.

According to NPR member station WMFE, ""The gunman took club patrons hostage between 2:00 a.m and 5:00 a.m early Sunday morning. Orlando Police say calls from the bathroom of the club help coordinate the rescue effort.""

The shooting occurred at Pulse, a gay nightclub, though authorities say it's not clear on whether that made the club a target.

""We are heartbroken and angry that senseless violence has once again destroyed lives in our state and in our country,"" said Equality Florida Executive Director Nadine Smith in a statement. ""Gay clubs hold a significant place in LGBTQ history. They were often the only safe gathering place and this horrific act strikes directly at our sense of safety.""

Governor Rick Scott has declared a state of emergency in Orange County and has labeled the shooting an act of terror.

“It sickens me and makes me angry,"" the governor said in a statement, ""Of course, this is a time of great tragedy, and in every tragedy, there is a flood of sadness, confusion and despair. But, this is an attack on our people. An attack on Orlando. An attack on Florida. An attack on America. An attack on all of us.""

The gunman has been identified. He is a U.S. citizen from Port St. Lucie. Law enforcement is working to learn more about what may have motivated the attack. U.S. Senator Bill Nelson says the FBI is looking into links to ISIS.

“I have spoken with the FBI and there appears to be a link to Islamic radicalism. I have conferred with additional sources and they think there is likely a connection with ISIS. So as we all mourn the senseless loss of life and investigators continue to learn more, we must remain vigilant and remember that if you see something, say something.”

Followed categories will be added to My News.

After calling 911 to declare his allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group, Mateen gunned down partygoers in the worst mass shooting in recent US history.

Massachusetts authorities have also said Mateen referenced the Boston Marathon bombers in his 911 call.

Twitter accounts which claim to be affiliated to the Islamic State have hailed the shooting, although it can’t be confirmed whether the terror group was behind the attack and the extent of Mateen’s links to the terror group have also not been verified.

The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee has told The Associated Press that investigators have not yet found evidence of direct communication between the Orlando nightclub gunman and Islamic State members overseas.

Mateen came to the attention of federal authorities twice prior to being identified as the gunman in the Orlando nightclub mass shooting, said Ronald Hopper, an assistant agent in charge of the FBI’s Tampa Division.

“The FBI first became aware of him in 2013 when he made inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible terrorist ties,” but could not find any incriminating evidence, Hopper said.

In 2014, the bureau investigated him again, for possible ties to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American who grew up in Florida but went to Syria to fight for an extremist group and detonated a suicide bomb. Hopper said the bureau concluded that the contact between the two men was minimal, and that Mateen “did not constitute a substantive threat at that time”.

Authorities did confirm that Mateen legally purchased at least two firearms within the past week or so.

Mateen was born to Afghan parents in New York in 1986 and was living in Port St. Lucie, Florida, police said.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN that Mateen “made a pledge of allegiance to ISIS”.

Schiff said the timing and target of the attack can’t be a coincidence.

“The fact that this shooting took place during Ramadan and that ISIS leadership in Raqqa has been urging attacks during this time, that the target was an LGBT nightclub during (LGBT) Pride (month) and, if accurate, that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to ISIS, indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism,” Schiff said.

Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique, told NBC “This has nothing to do with religion”.

Seddique said his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a few months ago. He believes that incident may be related to Sunday’s shooting.

“We are saying, we are apologising for the whole incident. We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.”

Seddique also told NBC that Mateen had a three-year-old son and that he worked a security job at Indian River State College, which he also attended.

However the activities of Mateen’s father have also come into question. A former Afghan official says Seddique Mir Mateen appears on a television program known for “its anti-U.S. tirades” and “pro-Taliban” remarks. The official says the program is broadcast in the Dari language. The official spoke only on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be linked to coverage of the shooting.

Mateen’s ex-wife told the Washington Post that he was violent and mentally unstable and beat her repeatedly while they were married.

The ex-wife said she met him online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida and marry him.

At first, the marriage was normal, she said, but then he became abusive.

“He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that,” said his ex-wife.

She told the paper that Mateen wasn’t very religious and worked out at the gym often.

“He seemed like a normal human being,” she said.

She said in the few months they were married he gave no signs of having fallen under the sway of radical Islam.

The ex-wife said her parents intervened when they learned Mateen had assaulted her. Her father confirmed the account and said that the marriage lasted only a few months.

At least 50 people were killed and 53 are wounded after a gunman opened fire inside an Orlando nightclub early Sunday, according to the local police chief and mayor.

 

 The suspect was identified as 29-year-old Omar Saddiqui Mateen, seen in the photo gallery below, of Port St. Lucie, Florida.

Reports say Mateen was born in New York. His ex-wife told The Washington Post that Mateen's family was from Afghanistan. The family later moved to Florida.

 

 The NYPD said in a statement that it is closely monitoring the investigation, is in contact with the FBI and Florida law enforcement authorities in Florida, and has deployed additional counter terrorism resources throughout New York City, ""particularly at LGBTQ facilities to keep all [New Yorkers] safe.""

Police said the shooting happened at a well-known gay club, Pulse Orlando, around 2 a.m.

Police Chief John Mina said 50 people were killed, up from an up from the 20 reported earlier.

Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said the shooter is among the dead.

 

 Organizers of the 70th annual Tony Awards announced that victims of the shooting would be honored at Sunday night's award show.

Authorities said an off-duty officer who worked at the club was the first to respond and eventually engaged with the suspect.

Police said the gunman, who was armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, ran back into the club and held the remaining people hostage for what lasted around three hours.

By 5 a.m., police broke down the door with an armored vehicle, letting 30 people inside the club go safely.

Officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who died in the exchange.

 

 Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were among many the New York politicial figures who weighed in on the shooting Sunday.



It took authorities hours to find all the victims inside the club, and they said they are still identifying all of the dead and wounded. Law enforcement leaders tell us that, along with notifying their families, could take hours.

In addition to the guns, the shooter also had some sort of ""suspicious device,"" Mina said.

Police had said previously on Twitter that there was a ""controlled explosion"" at the scene of the shooting. Mina said that noise was caused by a device intended to distract the shooter.

""It was just one after another, after another, after another,"" said a witness describing the scene when gunshots broke out inside the club.

""It could've lasted a whole song. Because after everybody was out, shootings were still going and the cops were yelling, 'Go, go, clear the area, clear the area!'""

Club-goer Rob Rick said the shooting started just before closing time.

""Everybody was drinking their last sip,"" he said.

 

 The shooting is the deadliest in the nation's history, eclipsing the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre in which 32 were killed, and the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in which 27 died.

Many of the wounded are in critical condition. One officer was injured in the shooting, but not seriously, as his police helmet protected him.

Dozens of police vehicles swarmed the area around the club. At least two police pickup trucks were seen taking what appeared to be shooting victims to the Orlando Regional Medical Center.

Officials said the shooting is being investigated as a terror attack and a hate crime.

""I think it's more likely than not that it was an ideologically-motivated attack,"" Florida Rep. Alan Grayson, (R), said at a press conference.

""Right now, we don't have any direct information that he was associated with any particular group. But it does seem that it's no coincidence that the attack took place where it did.""

 

 The FBI had investigated Mateen twice in the past for possible ties to Islamic extremism, but there was not enough evidence to charge him.

The FBI had been at Mateen's Florida home for the better part of Sunday, hoping to understand what lead up to this deadly rampage.

 

 NY1 learned that Mateen had recently purchased two firearms in just the past few days: a hand gun and possibly a high-powered rifle.

Mateen had called 911 at the time of the attack, but the FBI has not confirmed it was to pledge allegiance to ISIS, which is what sources have told the Associated Press.

Mateen's father, Mir Seddique, said he is in shock and that he was not aware of anything his son might have been planning.

""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident,"" Seddique said. ""We are in shock like the whole country.""

Seddique also said the incident has nothing to do with religion.

House Speaker Paul Ryan also reacted on Twitter to news of the shooting.

Weighing in on the shooting, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Sen. Charles Schumer, and City Comptroller Scott Stringer focused on their call for more gun control.

""Once again, this is a terrible reminder of the rampant gun violence we have in this nation,"" Cuomo said. ""I'm glad this state is taking action, because the gun violence is just getting worse and worse and worse.""

""It's a terrible tragedy. We don't know the details yet, but one thing we do know: no one should have an AR 15, an assault weapon. That's what was used here and it killed so many people so quickly,"" Schumer said.

 

 ""This is such a terrible national tragedy. Look, I think this country has to make a decision about these guns. The more guns out there, the more tragedies were gonna have,"" Stringer said. ""But this is so terrible, so many innocent lives lost. And every time we decry the violence, and yet it seems to be getting worse.""

 

 ""We in New York know this pain; we've been through it before. And we know that when something like this happens, the entire community feels it. Every neighborhood, people of every background — we feel it together,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the Muslim Community Network's 6th Annual Gala on Sunday.

 

 Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for Orange County, Florida, the county in which Orlando resides.

Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said their home state and the nation will not give in to terror.

""I hope they see today that they won't terrorize Americans, they won't terrorize Floridians, that we stand for and with all Americans, irrespective of their sexual orientation, irrespective of their party ideology, irrespective of where they live,"" Rubio said.

 

 ""We are all Americans,"" Rubio continued. ""You're seeing the response today, and this will continue. This will make us stronger. They will not win.""

""Clearly, this is an act of terrorism,"" Scott said. ""You just can't imagine this happening in any community, can't imagine happening in your state if you're the governor of a state, and you can't imagine this happening in your country.""

 

 The White House also issued a statement, sending thoughts and prayers to the families and loved ones of the victims.

President Obama also said he is dedicating federal resources to help with the ongoing investigation.

 Separately, a heavily-armed man was arrested Sunday in Los Angeles after he planned to carry out an attack at the city's gay pride parade, according to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.

Authorities said the man has been identified as 20-year-old James Wesley Howell of Indiana.

Local police said when they arrested Howell, they found three assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, ammunition, and a five-gallon bucket filled with chemicals that could have been used to make a bomb.

Police officers said they were tipped off by Santa Monica residents who said the man looked suspicious.

Santa Monica's police chief said Howell told officers he wanted to harm the gay pride event in West Hollywood, where hundreds of thousands of people were gathered.

In a news conference, Garcetti said his city stands with the people of Orlando.

""We are Pulse, we are Orlando, we are Americans, we are all LGBTQ community members today,"" Garcetti said. ""We are all part of a country that will not be beaten down, we will not go away, and today we are proud of who we are.""

Rick Scott (R) on Sunday refused to acknowledged that the LGBT community had been targeted by a shooter who killed at least 50 people at a gay-themed night club.

During an interview on CNN, host Jake Tapper pointed out that the LGBT community ""appears to have been directly targeted in this attack.""

""There are a lot of members of that community and supporting friends and family who are very worried,"" Tapper explained. ""Obviously if this was radical Islam, which the special agent in charge of the FBI suggested it may have been, that is a community that has been under siege from radical Islam.""

""Are you taking any special precautions,"" the CNN host wondered, ""especially during Pride month, but also in Florida, which is known as being hospitable to the gay and lesbian community, to make sure that community is protected?""

Scott, however, declined to acknowledge the LGBT community in his response.

""We don't want anybody in our state to ever be targeted,"" he insisted. ""We don't want anybody to be discriminated against. And so in every case, when we believe there is somebody doing the wrong thing, we work hard to make sure we take care of them.""

""And so what we'll -- you know, as we go through this process, what we'll learn through this, is we'll learn what we can do to hopefully to never, never, ever to let this happen again,"" the governor added.

""But, I guess my point is you've declared a state of emergency in Orange County,"" Tapper replied. ""But there are areas of the state of Florida -- South Beach, for example -- where there may be a large and thriving LGBT community that might be very, very afraid this morning.""

""Are you taking precautions?"" the CNN host pressed. ""Are you sending law enforcement to make sure there are no copy cats or just in case this individual wasn't a lone wolf, that that community is being protected?""

""Absolutely,"" Scott replied, refusing to refer to the gay community by name. ""We have really good law enforcement in our state. And when something like this happens, one of the first things you do on top of dealing with the issue you have at hand, is say, 'Who else could this impact and what can we do to make sure that does not happen?'""

Tapper concluded by asking the governor what Americans could do to help the victims of this attack.

""Just pray,"" Scott said. ""Pray for the victims, pray for their families, pray that this never happens again.""

US President Barack Obama has made a statment condemning the attack, the worst mass shooting in American history. The president has called the shooting a “horrific massacre” and an act of terrorism and hate. “Although it’s still early in the investigation, we know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” Obama said in a public address.

“The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism,” he said. “And I’ve directed that we must spare no effort to determine what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups. What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred. Over the coming days, we’ll uncover why and how this happened.”

The president said the attack was “especially heartbreaking” for those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. “The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub—it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.”

He also made a point about the ease at which people can get their hands on deadly weapons. “This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

Obama has ordered that all flags at the White House and other government buildings be lowered to half-mast in respect to the victims.

The club where the shooting occurred took to Facebook and Twitter to thank the public for their support: “Please keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event. Thank you for your thoughts and love.”

One Pulse patron, who managed to escape the club unharmed, expressed his disbelief at the situation. “I was thinking, ‘Are you kidding me?’ So I just dropped down. I just said, ‘Please, please, please, I want to make it out.’ And when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood,” said Christopher Hansen, who was in the VIP lounge when the shooting broke out.

Local authorities have also made statements about the shooting. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, said “This is an incident, as I see it, that we certainly classify as domestic terror incident”, while Florida Governer Rick Sott said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, families and all those affected by this horrific tragedy. We are a strong and resilient state and we will devote every resource available to assist with the shooting in Orlando.”

Equality Florida spoke out about the anti-gay sentiment behind the attack. “We are heartbroken and angry that senseless violence has once again destroyed lives in our state and in our country. Gay clubs hold a significant place in LGBTQ history. They were often the only safe gathering place and this horrific act strikes directly at our sense of safety.”

Meanwhile, people worldwide have responded to the event on social media platforms, with hashtags such as #Orlando, #PulseNightclub, #gunsense, #ThoughtsAndPrayers, #PulseShooting, #LoveConquersHate, #GunReformNOW, #Islamophobia and #TheNRA all trending on Twitter. World leaders have also sent their condolences to those affected by the tragedy and condemned the attack.

Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted: “Woke up to hear the devastating news from FL. As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act.”

Clinton later posted the following statement on Facebook, vowing to fight terrorism and crimes of hate. She also stated that something needs to be done to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.

Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump tweeted: “Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?” Tweet from Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidate.

In a statement, French President Francois Hollande said he “condemns with horror” the mass killing in Florida and “expresses the full support of France and the French with America’s authorities and its people in this difficult time”.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said, “My thoughts go out to the victims, to which I offer my condolences, as well as the many wounded, to whom I wish a speedy recovery. I express my solidarity to the American people and its authorities in this terrible ordeal.”

Britain’s Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that he was “horrified” by the attack.

Italian Premier Matteo Renzi posted, “Our heart is with our American brothers.”

Deputy Prime Minister of Republic of Turkey, Mehmet Simsek, tweeted: “I condemn, unequivocally, the horrific terrorist attack in #Orlando - as we’ve seen time & again, terrorism knows no religion, creed or race.”

Rasha Mubarak, Orlando regional co-ordinator for Florida’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, expressed similar sentiments. “We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence.” .

Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff of California said he would be marching in a gay pride parade in solidarity with the victims. “This morning, I will be marching in the West Hollywood Pride Parade with a heavy heart, but we will march in solidarity with all those who are the victims of terrorism and hatred.”

And the outpouring from the general public has been filled with messages of frustration and anger over gun violence and lax guns laws.","WORLD leaders, authorities and the public have expressed their shock and devastation at the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

Our hearts break for the devastated families and friends of those killed or wounded at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Fla. We, and too many other families across the country, understand their pain and sorrow now and in the days and years to come. Our thoughts remain with them, the loved ones killed, those injured, and the countless traumatized.

As we all woke up on what would otherwise be a beautiful day in Connecticut, we were horrified to learn that we were all now witness to the worst mass shooting in United States history. A gunman from Florida opened fire at Pulse Nightclub overnight, killing at least 50 and wounding at least 53 others.

There are reports that this is related to domestic terrorism, and could also be a hate crime, as it took place at a popular gay club during Pride Month. But, what we do know, unequivocally, is that every American should be able to feel safe to enjoy a night out in any place, during any month, and at any time. Just like we should all expect to be safe at the movies, at church, and at school.

Through the horror, we continue to pray for the victims and their families, as well as the many still wounded and recovering. We know that these atrocities can often make a person feel helpless or like hope is lost. It is not. We must stand together and work for an end to gun violence in America. We must work tirelessly until we are able to live in a world that is safer for all.

Join us to honor the lives lost by vowing to do all you can to help prevent gun violence. Make the Promise, talk to your legislators, get your community involved, and encourage kindness and inclusion.

Early this morning, in an act of unimaginable savagery, the lives of at least fifty innocent men and women were cruelly snuffed out in a mass shooting at an Orlando, Florida nightclub.

Regardless of the gunman's precise motive, which is still not known with certainty at this hour, this was clearly yet another unfathomable act of evil, of hate, perpetrated against good and decent people who loved their lives and did nothing wrong. Their loss, and the loss their friends and loved ones must now somehow endure, is simply incomprehensible -- and heartbreaking.

Earlier today, I spoke with our own police chief, Greg Mullen, who reports that he is in contact with state and federal officials, and that all appropriate actions are being taken here locally to secure our citizens against a similar tragedy. In addition, I have placed a call to Mayor Dyer in Orlando to offer whatever assistance we can to those now responding to this horrific event.

One year ago this week, we here in Charleston were brought face to face with the same kind of evil that the people of Orlando are being forced to reckon with today, when nine beautiful souls were viciously stolen from us by a racist gunman in the basement of Mother Emanuel AME church.

We will never forget the horror of that hot, sticky June night, or of the terrible days and weeks that followed. We will never understand the evil that drove a young man, born and raised here in our state, to carry out that unimaginable crime. And we will never stop giving thanks for the remarkable courage and grace of the Mother Emanuel families, who looked beyond their own pain to show us the way to hope and reconciliation -- and in the process, did so much to help lift our city through those terrible times.

The thoughts and prayers of all Charlestonians are with the people of Orlando today, as we grieve for the lost and for those they left behind. And as we remain determined to live out the full meaning of St. Paul's admonition that we ""be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.""","Today, Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg released the following statement, on the horrific mass shooting in Orlando, Florida:"

A manager at a prominent Toronto gay bar said the massacre likely won’t prompt his establishment to increase security at the club.

“You can’t live in fear because of one incident,” said Cameron Rennie, a manager and bartender at Woody’s in Toronto.

Officials from Pride Toronto, a not-for-profit with the goal of bringing together the city’s LGBTQ community, which also organizes Toronto’s pride month, released a written Staten saying that they stand united with the community.

In the statement, officials said they will “continue to work” with security officials looking forward at the rest of the Pride events including Toronto’s traditional parade.

Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale tweeted that he is shocked by the mass shooting, and that his thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims.

A manager at a prominent Toronto gay bar said the massacre likely won’t prompt his establishment to increase security at the club.

“You can’t live in fear because of one incident,” said Cameron Rennie, a manager and bartender at Woody’s in Toronto.

Officials from Pride Toronto, a not-for-profit with the goal of bringing together the city’s LGBTQ community, which also organizes Toronto’s pride month, released a written Staten saying that they stand united with the community.

The FBI said the 29-year-old killer born in New York was an American citizen who legally purchased two firearms within the last week.

Despite being aware of Mateen since 2013, following inflammatory comments made to co-workers and over ties to an American suicide bomber in 2014, he was not under surveillance.

Authorities deemed his link to the bomber to be minimal so did not constitute a threat, and after interviews and an investigation dropped the probe into his comments.

It has been revealed that 911 calls involving the shooter from Port St Lucie, Florida and featuring conversations about the Islamic State before the massacre, have now become federal evidence.

US president Barack Obama called the killings at the gay-friendly establishment an ""act of terror"" and an ""act of hate"" and said they are being investigated as terrorism.

More than 300 people were inside the building at the time of the attack, which has now become the worst mass shooting in American history - 53 people have also been taken to hospital.

President Obama praised the emergency service response and described the gunman as a person ""filled with hatred"".

He said the massacre is a reminder of how easy it is for someone to access a weapon like a gun, allowing them to go on and shoot other people.

""We have to decide if that is the type of country we want to be. To actively to do nothing is a decision as well,"" Mr Obama added.

The first names of the victims have now been released by the police - Edward Sotomayor Jr, Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero are among the dead.

Mir Seddique, the father of the shooter, told NBC News that he thinks a recent experience in which his son saw two men kissing might be related to the shooting.

He apologised for the whole incident, said he was not aware of the actions of his security guard son and claimed ""this had nothing to do with religion"".

The killer, who also held hostages in a three-hour stand-off, later died in a gunfight with Swat officers in the Florida city. He exchanged gunfire with 14 officers at the club.

Mr Obama has also ordered flags at the White House and federal buildings to be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect for the victims.

And in the aftermath of the massacre, police departments across the US increased patrols around popular gay-friendly locations and venues.

Orlando mayor, Buddy Dyer, described the scene saying there was ""blood everywhere"".

Political leaders from around the world have since condemned the attack and offered their condolences to the victims.

Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani said ""targeting civilians is not justifiable under any circumstances whatsoever"", while Prime Minister David Cameron said he was ""horrified"" by the shooting.

French president Francois Hollande said he ""expresses the full support of France and the French with America's authorities and its people in this difficult time"".

And Buckingham Palace said the Queen had sent a personal message to Mr Obama on Sunday night, saying: ""Prince Philip and I have been shocked by the events in Orlando.

Here's what we know about the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history:

MASS CASUALTIES: At least 50 people were killed, and 53 were hospitalized, most in critical condition, officials said. A surgeon at Orlando Regional Medical Center said the death toll was likely to climb.

THE SHOOTER: Authorities have identified the shooter as 29-year-old Omar Mateen of Fort Pierce, Florida.

In a 911 call from the club, Mateen professed allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Mateen was a U.S. citizen born in New York. His ex-wife said his family was from Afghanistan.

Authorities say Mateen was not under surveillance, but that in 2014, they discovered he had ties to an American suicide bomber. They said the ties were minimal and they didn't think he represented a threat at the time.

They say he also made inflammatory comments to co-workers in 2013.

Authorities also say Mateen legally purchased at least two firearms within the past week or so.

Security company G4S said in a statement to the Palm Beach Post that he had been an employee of the company since September 10, 2007.

Mateen's father, Seddique Mir Mateen, said his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago. He said that might be related to the attack. The father said the attack had nothing to do with religion.

FATHER'S ACTIVITIES: A former Afghan official says Seddique Mir Mateen appears on a television program known for ""its anti-U.S. tirades"" and ""pro-Taliban"" remarks. The official says the program is broadcast in the Dari language. The official spoke only on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be linked to coverage of the shooting.

WHAT HAPPENED: Police say Mateen, equipped with an assault rifle and a handgun, opened fire on patrons early Sunday. He also exchanged fire with an officer working at the club about 2 a.m., when more than 300 people were inside. Police say the gunman then went back inside and took hostages. Police sent in a SWAT team to rescue hostages about 5 a.m. and Mateen died in an exchange of gunfire with SWAT officers.

The city of Orlando is publishing the names of those killed on its website after their families have been contacted. The list can be found at:

Updates from the Associated Press on the Orlando attack:

The suspected Orlando nightclub gunman had been licensed as a private security officer in Florida.

State records show suspected shooter Omar Mateen held the firearms license since at least 2011. It was set to expire in September 2017.

It wasn't immediately clear where, if anywhere, Mateen had worked as a security officer. An armed guard license in Florida requires 28 hours of classroom training by a licensed instructor.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch is cutting short a visit to Beijing for cybersecurity meetings with Chinese officials and returning to the United States to monitor developments in the nightclub shooting investigation.

Lynch says the Justice Department, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is supporting the investigation.

She says in a statement that she's gotten updates from Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and FBI Director James Comey.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel stands ""shoulder to shoulder"" with the United States after the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando that killed 50 people and wounded dozens more.

Netanyahu said Sunday that ""on behalf of the people and government of Israel, I extend our deepest condolences to the American people following last night's horrific attack on the LGBT community in Orlando.""

He wished ""heartfelt sympathies to the families of the victims"" and ""full and speedy recovery to the wounded.""

The Orlando attack dominated news in Israel, which has seen a wave of Palestinian attacks in recent months. On Wednesday two Palestinian gunmen killed four people and wounded five others in Tel Aviv.

LGBT groups in Israel planned rallies and other support for the community in Orlando.

Police departments across the country are increasing patrols near locations frequented by the LGBT community after a gunman killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

In Los Angeles, the mayor says a heavily armed person who was headed to a gay pride parade had been arrested by Santa Monica police. Mayor Eric Garcetti says the arrest was completely unrelated to the Orlando nightclub shooting.

Officer Ernesto Rodriguez of Miami Beach Police Department says the agency is saddened by the massacre and out of an abundance of caution will step up patrols. Boston Pride organizers plan to hold a moment of silence at this weekend's scheduled block parties to honor the Orlando victims and police there said there will be a heavier presence at those events.

The Baltimore Police Department says it is reaching out to the city's LBGT community to discuss concerns and safety after the Orlando massacre.

President Barack Obama says the worst mass shooting in U.S. history is a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get a weapon that allows them to shoot people in a school, in a house of worship, a movie theater or a gay nightclub.

Speaking from the White House, Obama says the United States has to decide if that is the ""country we want to be."" He says that doing nothing is a decision as well.

The shooting has thrust the topic of gun control back into focus as a presidential election nears.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has called for expanding background checks to sales at gun shows and online purchases, and for reinstating a ban on assault weapons. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said the existing background check system should be fixed, not expanded, and that assault-weapons bans do not work.

President Barack Obama has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff at the White House and federal buildings until sunset Thursday ""as a mark of respect for victims of the act of hatred and terror"" at a gay Florida nightclub.

He's also directing the same observance at embassies and other U.S. government facilities abroad.

Obama addressed the nation Sunday, calling the shooting ""an act of terror"" and an ""act of hate.""

Fifty were killed, including the shooter, and 53 more hospitalized.

Donald Trump isn't pausing his political commentary for the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history unfolding in Florida.

It was unclear whether the shooter who killed at least 50 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub was associated with a radical religious organization. President Barack Obama addressed the nation, calling the shooting ""an act of terror"" and an ""act of hate.""

Trump tweeted as Obama began speaking: ""Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!""

A law enforcement official tells The Associated Press that the shooter in the massacre at a gay Florida nightclub was known to the FBI before the incident and had been looked at by agents within the last few years.

The official spoke to The Associated Press Sunday about the shooting, the deadliest in U.S. history. The official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation and on spoke on condition of anonymity.

President Barack Obama says the nightclub shooting in Orlando was an ""act of terror"" and an ""act of hate.""

He said Sunday that the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism and that no effort will be spared to determine whether the shooter was affiliated with terrorist groups.

Obama is speaking at the White House after 50 people were killed overnight at a nightclub in Florida. Officials have said 53 more are hospitalized.

Obama is noting that the killer targeted a gay nightclub. He says it's a ""sobering reminder"" that an attack on any American is an attack ""on all of us.""

A bartender who was working at the Orlando nightclub when a gunman opened fire and killed 50 people and wounded about 50 others says at first she thought the gunshots were music.

But after a second shot there was a pause, and then more shots and Tiffany Johnson realized something was wrong.

Johnson says people dropped to the ground and started running out of the Pulse nightclub early Sunday morning. She ran to a fast-food restaurant across the street and met one of her customers who let her get in his car and they drove away.

Johnson says her first instinct was to get somewhere safe.

Sunday evening's Tony Awards have been dedicated to those affected by the Orlando nightclub shooting that killed at least 50 people.

In a statement Sunday, the Tony Awards said ""our hearts are heavy for the unimaginable tragedy."" The awards, it said, will be dedicated to the friends and family of those affected by the most deadly mass shooting in U.S. history.

Organizers didn't say how the evening's broadcast would be affected. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the star and creator of ""Hamilton"" -- expected to be the night's big winner -- tweeted a rainbow-colored heart with ""Orlando"" written beneath it.

The Tonys are to be hosted by late-night host James Corden.

The Vatican says Pope Francis is expressing the ""deepest feelings of horror and condemnation"" over a massacre at a gay Florida nightclub that killed at least 50 people.

Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi says the pontiff denounces the ""homicidal folly and senseless hatred.""

He added that Francis joins the families of victims and injured in the Sunday massacre in ""prayer and compassion.""

A law enforcement official says the shooter in the massacre at a gay Florida nightclub was known to the FBI before the incident and had been looked at by agents within the last few years.

The official spoke to The Associated Press Sunday about the shooting, the deadliest in U.S. history. The official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation and on spoke on condition of anonymity.

The shooter has been identified as Omar Mateen of Florida. The official says the matter for which Mateen came under investigation was ""open and closed pretty quickly.""

Other details about the matter weren't immediately available.

Hundreds of people in Orlando have lined up to give blood to help the victims of the massacre at a gay nightclub.

Officials at OneBlood say they have received such an overwhelming response that they are now asking donors to come back over the next several days. More than 50 people were injured and 50 were killed when a gunman opened fire inside a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning.

In the hours after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, officials urged people to donate blood to help the victims.

In December, the nation's three-decade-old ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men was formally lifted, but there are still major restrictions to limit who can give blood. The Food and Drug Administration said it replaced the lifetime ban with a new policy barring donations from men who have had sex with a man in the previous year.

The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee says law enforcement officials and the intelligence community are checking to see what information they had on the shooter prior to the massacre at a gay Florida nightclub.

Rep. Adam Schiff called the attack ""painfully reminiscent"" of the November shootings at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris.

He says in a statement, ""This morning, I will be marching in the West Hollywood Pride Parade with a heavy heart, but we will march in solidarity with all those who are the victims of terrorism and hatred.""

Florida Gov. Rick Scott is calling the shooting at a gay Orlando nightclub ""heartwrenching"" and says first responders who went into the building knowing there was an active shooter are heroic.

He spoke Sunday afternoon at a news conference, hours after 50 people were killed. Officials have said 53 more are hospitalized.

Scott urged people to donate blood. He says officials are doing everything they can.

He says: ""This is clearly an act of terrorism. It's sickening. It should make every American angry.""

Officials have said they're investigating whether the incident was an act of terrorism.

Law enforcement officials are beefing up security for a LGBT pride festival in Washington, D.C., after a deadly shooting at a gay club in Orlando.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a statement that she has been briefed by police Chief Cathy Lanier about increased security measures ahead of Sunday's Capital Pride Festival.

Bowser said Washingtonians ""will not be deterred by hate as we gather to celebrate love.""

Festival organizers said that there will be moment of silence for the victims of the Florida shooting at 1 p.m.

Officials said the shooting at the Orlando nightclub left at least 50 people dead, making it the worst mass shooting in American history.

A SWAT truck and a bomb disposal unit are on the scene of an address associated with the man named as the shooter in a massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

There is a media staging area set up about a block away from the apartment complex in a residential neighborhood in Fort Pierce, Florida, on Sunday. The shooter has been identified Omar Mateen.

Fort Pierce is about 118 miles southeast of Orlando. The apartment complex is a series of two-story buildings.

Numerous police officers and members of the FBI also area there.

The father of the man named as the shooter in a massacre at a gay Florida nightclub says he's in shock and that he wasn't aware of anything his son might have been planning.

Mir Seddique is the father of Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida. Seddique told NBC News that his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago and thinks that may be related to the shooting.

Seddique says: ""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. ... We are in shock like the whole country.""

The father also says the incident has nothing to do with religion.

Officials say the shooter was among the 50 killed, and that they're investigating whether the incident was an act of terrorism.

Many are still awaiting word on whether their loved ones are among the 50 killed and 53 hospitalized in a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

Thirty-two-year-old Christopher Leinonen was at the popular Pulse club and is missing. That's according to his mother, Christine Leinonen. She drove to Orlando at 4 a.m. She hasn't heard from her son and fears the worst. She was standing in front of an Orlando hospital just down the street from Pulse.

She says: ""These are nonsensical killings of our children. They're killing our babies!""

She said her son's friend made it out alive by hiding in the bathroom and running out as bullets were flying.

Also, on Sunday morning Facebook added a ""Facebook Safety Check"" for people to find out whether friends and family have tagged themselves as safe. The social network is using the heading ""The Shooting in Orlando, Florida.""

It is Facebook's way of allowing its users who live near the scene of a major crisis to notify people that they're OK.

Families and friends are awaiting word outside an Orlando hospital to learn whether their loved ones are among 50 killed and 53 more hospitalized at a shooting at a gay nightclub.

About 50 people were gathered outside Orlando Regional Medical Center on Sunday, many in tears and anxious.

Fatriana Evans frequents the Pulse nightclub and was outside when shots were fired.

Evans says, ""It sounded like fireworks - pop, pop, pop - and then everybody scatters.""

Jackie Smith was inside the club and says two friends next to her were shot. She says she hasn't gotten updates on their conditions. She came out of the hospital and burst into tears in the arms of friends.

She says: ""Some guy walked in and started shooting everybody. He had an automatic rifle, so nobody stood a chance. I just tried to get out of there.""

Police say the shooter at an Orlando nightclub used an AR-15-type assault rifle on all the victims.

Officials say 50 were killed at the popular gay club. That makes it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

Police Chief John Mina said at a Sunday news conference that the shooter used the assault rifle, with unknown rounds, and also had a handgun.

Officials at the news conference also say they have securing the suspect's vehicle, a van, right outside the club.

The shooter has been identified as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida. Officials have said they're investigating whether the massacre was an act of terrorism.

Dr. Mike Cheatham is a trauma surgeon at Orlando Regional Medical Center, where 46 patients were taken. The majority are in critical condition.

He tells The Associated Press, ""I think we will see the death toll rise.""

The crash killed the pilot, Todd Silver, his mother and young son and seriously injured his 12-year-old daughter as they traveled here from Fort Lauderdale for a family reunion.

The report states they made a stop about 200 miles away in Pine Mountain, Georgia before the crash that day.

A man who lives near the runway and called 911 originally thought the plane was taking off when it crashed but the preliminary report cites a flight instructor in the air near Collegedale reported seeing the plane come in for a landing, making some sharp turns, before dropping nose-first beside the runway.

That instructor heard no calls for help on the radio.

Family members are updating a fundraising site with information on the sole survivor of that crash, Gabrielle Silver, 12. She's still in a Chattanooga hospital undergoing therapy and getting stronger every day.

It could take up to a full year before the NTSB releases the full report of the crash including what caused the plane to go down.

PREVIOUS STORY: The National Transportation Safety Board released their preliminary report on the Collegedale plane crash that claimed three lives earlier this month.

The report does not state a primary reason why the plane crashed.

A flight instructor at the airport, flying with a student pilot, told investigators that he observed the plane piloted by Todd Silver on a ""short final approach to runway 3.""

No communication was reported between the airport and Silver's plane, according to the flight instructor.

Silver's plane was ""seen [making] a climbing left turn, near the departure end of runway 3, approximately 80 to 100 feet above the ground. The airplane then made a steep 45 to 60-degree bank to the right, with a nose high attitude. As it progressed through the turn, the airplane's nose dropped and it began a slow 270-degree rotation at a high decent rate.""

Additionally, the NTSB report says that the plane's fuel selector switch was set to the left wing's fuel tank, which was found with approximately 15 gallons of fuel.

The right wing fuel tank was found to be empty, according to the report.

Both the oil suction and fuel servo inlet screens were free from debris, according to the report.

Weather conditions were considered to be favorable the day of the crash, with calm winds, visibility of 10 miles and temperatures of 93 degrees.

The sole survivor of the plane crash, 12-year-old Gabrielle is improving, according to updates from her mother, Jennifer Moritz:

Give thanks to the Lord for He is good! And His mercy endures forever!

Gabi is more awake and wants all the stuff off of her - we stand guard here 24/7 for now. (Little hands are quick) She is strong ??Only thing left today is feeding tube for nutrition and medicine and bp cuff. She is sad so please pray for her little heart and mind to be comforted (still don't know what she knows).

They are talking about maybe moving her to a room on the floor - they are also scheduling her inpatient rehab - so we are excited! It's a lot of work around here now - I will happily be caretaker now as she recovers - potentially a long road with head injury - I'm up for it!

Thank you all for continued prayers as we move forward with the Lord in this change of season??

PREVIOUS STORY: We continue to learn more about the moments following the weekend plane crash that killed two people. 911 records obtained by Channel 3 show an eyewitness and airport employee called to report the crash that happened shortly after 12:30 Saturday at the Collegedale Airport.

“A guy just flew in and had said a plane crashed off the end of the runway. If you're taking off runway three it crashed off it,” said a caller.

We have since learned the pilot out of Florida was badly injured, along with his young daughter. Silver's son and mother died in the crash.

Each summer students from South Plantation High School compete in the annual Solar Car Challenge at Texas Motor Speedway. They say they couldn't have taken home the bronze medal without the help and support of Todd Silver, the pilot from Saturday’s crash in Collegedale.

“We could not find anybody, anywhere, that did anything like this,” said Janna Hunt. She worked with Todd Silver helping students at South Plantation High School build a solar car. Students are thankful for the time Todd Silver invested in them. “He was a true mentor to the Solar Knights Racing Team. With that we were able to produce something really extraordinary.”

Silver was flying his 4 seater plane when it crashed Saturday at the Collegedale Airport. Silver's young son and mother died in the crash, that left his daughter in critical condition. “Tragic, it's tragic. It's sad, tragic. You can feel it. It's terrible, it's terrible,” said one eyewitness.

Silver is the owner of Todd’s Canopies. He helped design an award winning solar car for students at a local Florida high school. “He came to the school multiple times, created a frame, taught the kids how to do fiberglass. Pretty much how to do things from beginning to end,” said Hunt.

Former NTSB chairman, Jim Hall says the Mooney M20-E could have crashed for many reasons. The NTSB and FAA will do a thorough investigation. “The majority of these accidents are human error or maintenance, problems with the aircraft,” said Hall.

Eyewitnesses say they believe Silver may have been returning to the airport immediately after takeoff. Hall says by the way the plane fell, that's a possibility. “Certainly was a flat impact which might indicate there was an attempt to land the aircraft and it was unsuccessful.”

As both the Collegedale and Fort Lauderdale communities try to understand this tragedy students are reflecting on how Silver helped get them so far. To them he's more than a pilot he's a teacher. “Quirky personality, but has the biggest heart. He really loved teaching the kids, teaching them things they would never learn in school,” said Hunt.

It could be six months to a year before we learn the cause of the crash. Funeral arrangements are still pending for Suzanne Silver and Todd Silver's son -- whose name has not been released.

Both Todd and his daughter are still listed in critical condition at Erlanger.

Aviation officials spent the early part of Sunday surveying what's left of the single-engine plane that crashed Saturday at the Collegedale Airport. They hope the wreckage will help determine what caused the 4-seater Mooney M20-E to go down.

“They are going to look at how it impacted, they are going to look at what the propeller blades looked like. Was there an indication of the power on these blades when they hit,” said Dan Barks.

Collegedale police now say two of the four people on board were killed. The pilot, Todd Silver from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, survived and is in critical condition at a local hospital.

“It is very, very sad, my family sends out condolences and prayers to all the families involved in this crash,” said Bob Etheridge, a witness to the crash.

FAA records shows Silver purchased the aircraft last spring. Not only does he enjoy flying planes, he also enjoys working on them. He's the owner of Todd’s Canopies. It is a business that designs and fits different kinds of aircrafts with canopies.

On his public Facebook page, he recently posted pictures of a trip to Key West in the same plane that crashed in Collegedale.

”Unfortunate, you're thinking of the families that are waiting for loved ones to come home and may not see them tonight. That’s the price of these crashes,” said Barks.

Eyewitnesses say they saw Silver struggling to reach altitude and could quickly tell something was wrong. Bob Etheridge believes the plane may have been returning to the airport immediately following take off due to some kind of issue.

“Circling rather quickly maybe the pilot was trying to come back. Unfortunate he didn't make it,” said the Etheridge.

As officials comb through the wreckage for answers, news of this deadly accident is still sinking in.

“Tragic, it's sad, it's tragic. You can feel it. It's terrible.. it's terrible,” said one neighbor.

Silver was flying with his mother, Suzanne Silver, and his two children, a boy and girl when the crash happened.

Silver's mother and son were pronounced dead on the scene.

Silver and his daughter were flown to a local hospital where they were listed in critical condition as of Saturday.

But the rampage may also have set another disturbing precedent, marking the first large-scale attack inspired by Islamist extremism that successfully targeted the LGBT community in a Western country.

The shooter who stormed the Pulse nightclub, identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, declared his allegiance to the Islamic State in a 911 call shortly before he cut down dozens of people and set off a scene of unspeakable carnage that ended with his own death Sunday morning. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq “news agency,” but authorities said it was unclear if Mateen had clear links to the group, or if he was merely a lone wolf inspired by its propaganda.

Over the past year, the Islamic State has orchestrated major attacks in Paris and Brussels at concert halls, cafes, subway stations, and airports that aimed at killing as many people as possible in an arbitrary fashion. But the group has not previously singled out the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community in its deadly assaults in the West.

In Syria and Iraq, however, the group has brutally executed gay men in towns under its control, posting grisly videos of blindfolded victims being thrown off the roofs of buildings. At least 36 men have been killed by militants on the basis of draconian sodomy charges enforced by the Islamic State, according to OutRight Action International. In Bangladesh, Islamist militants have for years targeted gay bloggers, among others, for assassination; on Sunday, authorities there detained thousands of suspected militants in a pre-emptive raid.

President Barack Obama called the shooting “an act of terror and an act of hate” and noted that it occurred during Pride festivities across the country, an annual celebration of the LGBT community.

“The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing and to live,” Obama said Sunday at the White House. “So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.”

Obama said that authorities have “no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer,” or “what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups.”

The Islamic State claimed the gunman as one of its own: “The armed attack that targeted a gay nightclub in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida which left over 100 people dead or injured was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” the group’s Amaq agency said.

But Mateen’s father said his son never demonstrated much of an interest in radical Islamist doctrine or religion, though he had expressed anger recently over seeing two men kissing in Miami. And his ex-wife said Mateen had beat her and was mentally ill and unstable.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that a number of signs — including the Islamic State’s calls for attacks during Ramadan, the gunman’s declaration in his 911 call, and his targeting of a gay nightclub during Pride — indicated that the attack was “an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism.” He added: “Whether this attack was also ISIS-directed remains to be determined.”

Mateen was hardly unknown to federal authorities: The FBI investigated him on two separate occasions. In 2013, he came under suspicion for making inflammatory comments alleging he had ties to terrorists, but authorities could not find sufficient evidence to pin charges on him. Then, in 2014, the FBI looked at Mateen’s possible ties to a notorious figure, Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria.

The FBI concluded that the contact between the two men — who both lived in Fort Pierce, Florida — had been “minimal” and that Mateen “did not constitute a substantive threat at that time,” Ronald Hopper, assistant agent in charge of the FBI’s Tampa division, told reporters in Orlando.

Western governments have struggled to contain the fallout from hate-filled propaganda touting Islamist violence, even as the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate continues to shrink on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria, experts said.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi “knows if he calls for terror it will come,” said author Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “He doesn’t need any direct human connection or even a web connection. His message is so pervasive in the media and so simple it is certain to inspire the angry.”

There’s plenty of anger to stoke. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation are commonplace in the United States, but those attacks have not been on a large-scale or linked directly to foreign terrorist groups or their propaganda. A 1990 bombing of a gay bar in Greenwich Village in New York that injured three people was eventually blamed on a suspected Islamist terrorist.

According to the FBI’s most recent statistics, in 2014, hate crimes against gay Americans accounted for more than 18 percent of the 1,017 such incidents across the country, with about 2 percent occurring in gay bars or nightclubs.

Orlando’s tragedy threw the 2016 election into stark relief Sunday, drawing markedly different responses from the two presumptive presidential nominees, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state emphasized it was both terrorism and a hate crime, while Trump initially made no mention of the LGBT community and accepted “congratulations” from his Twitter followers for having foreseen an attack.

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,” the Republican tweeted. “We must be smart!” Later Sunday, he piled on, calling for the president’s resignation and for Clinton to drop out of the presidential race. In a final statement Sunday evening, he said, “Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans,” concluding, “We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.”

Trump’s campaign said he’ll give a speech Monday on the attack, immigration, and national security.

Clinton, a Democrat who has made national security central to her campaign, vowed to continue the Obama administration’s fight against the Islamic State and its ilk, stressing the role of multinational coalitions and the need to upend terrorist recruitment networks. “It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,” she said, promising as well to fight for the rights of the LGBT community.

“Hate has absolutely no place in America,” Clinton said. “To the LGBT community: Please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them.”

Beyond the politics of the presidential race, in Orlando, the attack has left a sense of disbelief, pain, and outrage.

“There’s a lot of anger,” Florida State Sen. Darren Soto, who represents Orlando, told Foreign Policy on Sunday. “Many of us woke up shocked to find our happy little town was the site of the largest mass shooting in American history.”

“We have a large and proud gay community here that’s a fundamental part of our culture, and for them to be targeted in a potentially international terrorist attack is just upsetting and mind-boggling.”",The Florida attack could mark a dangerous new tactic for Islamic State-inspired extremists — singling out the LGBT community in the West.

Many details are currently unknown about the incident, and you can read the Tampa Bay Times’ coverage of developments here. But as the full story unfolds, we wanted to note several recurring points made in the gun debate in recent years.

Here are seven facts and figures you need to know.

1. Over 32,000 people die from gun violence each year.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 33,636 gun deaths in 2013, the latest year for which data is available, or about 90 people per day. From 2009 to 2013, an average of 32,100 people died from gun-related causes each year. But not all of these deaths are the result of homicides. In fact, more than 60 percent of the deaths in 2013 were suicides.

2. That’s more than the number of casualties in all wars in American history and far more than killed by terrorist attacks.

New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof offered this data point after the August 2015 on-air slaying of two journalists in Virginia: ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history.""

That’s True. About 1.4 million were killed in major conflicts starting from the Revolutionary War to the Iraq war, while there have been 1.5 million gun-related deaths since 1968.

A few months later, after the Oregon community college shooting in October 2015, President Barack Obama challenged the media to tally up the number of gun-related deaths and the number of terrorist-related deaths in the last decade.

That’s about 302,000 gun-related deaths versus 71 terrorism casualties, using numbers from 2005 to 2013 and preliminary counts from 2014 and 2015 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

3. The number of mass shootings is hard to pin down.

After the Oregon shooting, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz tweeted, ""380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone.""

But definitions for mass shooting vary. The federal government, for example, only counts incidents with deaths. The Mass Shooting Tracker, a popular crowd-sourced site used by the Washington Post, considers any incident in which four or more people are killed or injured a mass shooting.

There were 296 mass shootings by the time of Wasserman Schultz’s tweet according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, but 122 of those incidents resulted in no casualties. We rated Wasserman Schultz’s claim Half True.

4. The gun death rate in the United States is higher than that of other developed countries, but gun violence isn’t unique to the United States.

Addressing the nation after the Charleston shooting in June 2015, President Obama said, ""This type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.""

We rated his claim Mostly False. There have been at least 23 incidents of mass shootings in 10 other countries. In the same time period, however, there were 133 incidents in the United States alone.

Obama was more on target when he tweeted, ""Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel.""

Obama’s figures are accurate, but the data is a bit old and not standardized, and at least one other data set shows lower numbers. We rated his claim Mostly True.

5. The overwhelming majority of Americans support background checks for gun purchases.

Polls consistently show 80 to 90 percent of Americans are in favor of criminal background checks for gun sales. A 2013 poll found that 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks.

National law requires background checks in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but many states (including Florida) do not require checks for private sales.

6. The terrorist watch list isn’t an obstacle to buying guns, and violent felons determined to buy guns can circumvent the background check requirement by purchasing guns online.

More than 2,000 people on the FBI’s list have legally purchased weapons since 2004, according to a 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. That’s about 91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns. (It’s worth noting that a 2009 Justice Department audit found that 35 percent of people on the list shouldn’t be on it.)

Unlike suspected terrorists, felons are prohibited from purchasing guns but it is possible online. Because private sellers are not required to run background checks, felons are able to purchase guns over the Internet if he orshe is in the same state as the seller.

7. The connection between gun laws and crime is still debated.

Gun rights advocates argue that more guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens means less crime. That idea can be traced to an influential and controversial study that showed a 25 percent decrease in violent crime and a 178 percent rise in the number of concealed-carry permits from 2007 to 2014. Correlation, however, doesn’t mean causation and many have refuted the study’s findings.

Similarly, there is research showing that the more gun laws a state has, the fewer gun deaths there are. But this doesn’t prove a universal cause-and-effect relationship and could just be a correlation. It could be that low numbers of gun owners in a state mean less opposition to gun laws, and the low rate of gun ownership means less gun violence. Experts say that there needs to be more research on gun violence and its causes.","Fifty people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning, the largest mass shooting in U.S. history.

At a news conference Monday, Gov. Rick Scott named and described some of the victims, including 37-year-old Kimberly Morris, a bouncer at the club, and Luis Vielma, a 22-year-old who worked in the Harry Potter World at Universal Studios Orlando. 

 

""These are people that we interact with every day of our lives,"" Scott said. 

 

They range in age from 19 to 50 years old and include a local college student, a pharmacy technician, a business professional, a singer, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters and friends.

At an early morning news conference, Orlando police chief, John Mina, said police officers had three confrontations with the gunman, identified as Omar Mateen, who was killed by the police at the club early Sunday morning. 

 

Investigators continued on Monday morning to scour the crime scene for evidence and piece together the gunmanâs motive. Thirty victim witness specialists and crime reconstruction experts were on the scene processing as much evidence as possible, F.B.I. officials said. 

 

Condolences and reactions poured in from around the country and around the world. 

 

A statement from the Vatican said that ""Pope Francis joins the families of the victims and all of the injured in prayer and in compassion,"" while in a statement posted on Twitter, French President Francois Hollande condemned the attack. 

 

In a statement, Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay U.S. senator, described the shooting as ""not only a horrific attack on the LGBT community, it was an attack on the freedoms we all hold dear."" 

 

Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was nearly killed during a mass shooting in 2011, said in a joint statement with her husband that such events cannot be accepted ""as a new normal."" 

 

""We cannot let armed ambushes become the new normal in our country,"" said Giffords, who now helps run an anti-gun violence organization with her husband, Mark Kelly. ""We have to do better than this.""

That’s about 302,000 gun-related deaths versus 71 terrorism casualties, using numbers from 2005 to 2013 and preliminary counts from 2014 and 2015 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

3. The number of mass shootings is hard to pin down.

After the Oregon shooting, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz tweeted, ""380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone.""

But definitions for mass shooting vary. The federal government, for example, only counts incidents with deaths. The Mass Shooting Tracker, a popular crowd-sourced site used by the Washington Post, considers any incident in which four or more people are killed or injured a mass shooting.

There were 296 mass shootings by the time of Wasserman Schultz’s tweet according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, but 122 of those incidents resulted in no casualties. We rated Wasserman Schultz’s claim Half True.

4. The gun death rate in the United States is higher than that of other developed countries, but gun violence isn’t unique to the United States.

Addressing the nation after the Charleston shooting in June 2015, President Obama said, ""This type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.""

We rated his claim Mostly False. There have been at least 23 incidents of mass shootings in 10 other countries. In the same time period, however, there were 133 incidents in the United States alone.

Obama was more on target when he tweeted, ""Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel.""

Obama’s figures are accurate, but the data is a bit old and not standardized, and at least one other data set shows lower numbers. We rated his claim Mostly True.

5. The overwhelming majority of Americans support background checks for gun purchases.

Polls consistently show 80 to 90 percent of Americans are in favor of criminal background checks for gun sales. A 2013 poll found that 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks.

National law requires background checks in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but many states (including Florida) do not require checks for private sales.

6. The terrorist watch list isn’t an obstacle to buying guns, and violent felons determined to buy guns can circumvent the background check requirement by purchasing guns online.

More than 2,000 people on the FBI’s list have legally purchased weapons since 2004, according to a 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. That’s about 91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns. (It’s worth noting that a 2009 Justice Department audit found that 35 percent of people on the list shouldn’t be on it.)

Unlike suspected terrorists, felons are prohibited from purchasing guns but it is possible online. Because private sellers are not required to run background checks, felons are able to purchase guns over the Internet if he orshe is in the same state as the seller.

7. The connection between gun laws and crime is still debated.

Gun rights advocates argue that more guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens means less crime. That idea can be traced to an influential and controversial study that showed a 25 percent decrease in violent crime and a 178 percent rise in the number of concealed-carry permits from 2007 to 2014. Correlation, however, doesn’t mean causation and many have refuted the study’s findings.

Similarly, there is research showing that the more gun laws a state has, the fewer gun deaths there are. But this doesn’t prove a universal cause-and-effect relationship and could just be a correlation. It could be that low numbers of gun owners in a state mean less opposition to gun laws, and the low rate of gun ownership means less gun violence. Experts say that there needs to be more research on gun violence and its causes.","Fifty people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning, the largest mass shooting in U.S. history.

Be it Paris, Brussels or the recent tragedy that hit Florida today, one of the responses that we often get to see is ""Terrorism has no religion."" I personally believe nothing could be farther from truth. In my opinion, Terrorism definitely has a religion, whether it is the religion of Babbar Khalsa, Bajrang Dal, the Lord's Resistance Army or the ISIS. As long as you're carrying out attacks on innocent civilians in the name of your religion or after getting motivated by your religious sacred text, your terrorism, and extremism a religion.

As pointed out by Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, a renowned Pakistani Muslim theologian, a section of Muslims believe that people following polytheism deserve to die and it is Muslims job to implement that ""punishment."" This section of Muslims believes that non-Muslims are created only to be ruled over and any form of their government is temporary and Muslims will one day be ultimate rulers. There is no concept of ‘nation state’ and Muslims can have only one form of system which is Caliphate.

Continuous hammering of these doctrines breeds terrorism. In case of the recent unfortunate incident in Florida where the target was gay bar and a nightclub reflects the growing homophobia among the Muslims. Instead of admitting that these doctrines need reforms and counter narrative, my fellow Muslims, in the aftermath of such incidents usually involve themselves in less important issues like should words ""Islamist militants"" or “Muslim extremist” be used in the media while referring to attackers. Is using the term ""Muslim terrorists"" offensive and Islamophobic? Some try bringing in conspiracy theories, some bring in Middle East crises as a counterweight to a tragedy taking place in West, while most simply get away with it by saying ""no Muslim can do this"" and ""terrorism has no religion.""

The reality is bigger than that. No matter how much it ""offends"" us, there are Muslims who don't take Islam just as a religion but as an ideology which must be imposed on whole world. For this they go to any extent considering it as their religious obligation. These Muslims kill and die because they think they are fighting a sacred war and are promised a big reward in the life after. In this case, one doesn't have to be extraordinarily smart to point out what is it that is motivating them to carry out these activities, it is an ideology. We can argue that their ideology or interpretation of Islam is violent and different than ours but this does not mean that the violent Muslims are not Muslims. They represent an ideology that might not be followed by other peaceful Muslims who shouldn't be blamed for handful of terrorists but nevertheless that ideology exists and breeds terrorism.

Then of course, some Muslims rightfully hold Western powers like U.S and its European allies responsible for sponsoring terrorism, for creating and funding militant organizations in the past for their political interest, for invading and destroying Muslim countries, for creating a vacuum for these organizations, for having dual standards in their foreign policies. United States is also blamed for having terrible gun laws. While all this is true but there is definitely more to it. Yes, there is no doubt that in the past, US funded militants to fight the Soviets, but even back then, it was not the U.S Dollars but the ideology of ""sacred war"" which brought Muslims all the way from the Arab world and Pakistan to Afghanistan. So, even if the allegation that some Muslim militants are ""backed"" by Israel or United States, which is often given by Muslims, can be taken as true, even then, the people like Omar Mateen or thousands of those who are fighting for groups like ISIS, who str killing people in broad daylight in Paris, Beirut, Istanbul, Brussels, don't do it because anyone sitting in Tel Aviv or Washington funds them, they do it because they believe they are fighting a war for their God for which they will be rewarded in the life hereafter. Omar Mateen didn’t kill people because it was easy for him to own a gun; he killed innocent people in Florida because he saw those people to be on the “wrong side.” In such scenario, yes those who are backing them must also be blamed and so do the policies of United States regarding the gun control but the root cause of this is an ideology for which a counter narrative should be brought up.

Islam is a faith, a source of inspiration for billions around the globe, practicing it in personal lives is not a problem; forcefully imposing it on entire world . Considering yourself to be a reflection of God and taking upon yourself to implement any kind of ""punishment"" by killing innocent people is the problem.

Muslims don't need to apologize for the lives lost in Florida. Not every Muslim is responsible for today's tragic incident. They however need to stop lying that violent Muslims are not Muslims. Instead of coming up with lame excuses whether Hitler was a Muslim or whether Muslims were responsible behind initiating the two world wars and nuking Japan, try identifying the problem. The problem of violent extremism, the problem of growing homophobia in the Muslim world... but since it is difficult to stand up, take responsibility and work for reformation of specific doctrines through counter narratives, therefore people go for something easier which is to simply get away with it by saying ""no Muslim can do this"" and ""terrorism has no religion."" The more we stay in denial, the more we will be isolated.

Stop generalizing Muslims. 1.6 billion is a huge number. This 1.6 billion has produced Muhammad Ali as well as Omar Mateen; it has produced Abdul Sattar Edhi and it has also produced Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. Saying ""no Muslim can do this"" is as wrong and problematic as saying ""every Muslim is responsible for this terror act.""

The people who killed innocents in Paris, Brussels and Florida are the same who killed people in Peshawar, Baghdad, Beirut and Ankara. There is no difference. Instead of dividing ourselves in ""us and them"" instead of bringing out comparison of tragedies taking place in Muslim world, let's stand against these terrorists who somehow claim to be like us. These extremists don't differentiate between people when they kill them; we shouldn't either when we stand against them.

But the rampage may also have set another disturbing precedent, marking the first large-scale attack inspired by Islamist extremism that successfully targeted the LGBT community in a Western country.

The shooter who stormed the Pulse nightclub, identified as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, declared his allegiance to the Islamic State in a 911 call shortly before he cut down dozens of people and set off a scene of unspeakable carnage that ended with his own death Sunday morning. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq “news agency,” but authorities said it was unclear if Mateen had clear links to the group, or if he was merely a lone wolf inspired by its propaganda.

Over the past year, the Islamic State has orchestrated major attacks in Paris and Brussels at concert halls, cafes, subway stations, and airports that aimed at killing as many people as possible in an arbitrary fashion. But the group has not previously singled out the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community in its deadly assaults in the West.

In Syria and Iraq, however, the group has brutally executed gay men in towns under its control, posting grisly videos of blindfolded victims being thrown off the roofs of buildings. At least 36 men have been killed by militants on the basis of draconian sodomy charges enforced by the Islamic State, according to OutRight Action International. In Bangladesh, Islamist militants have for years targeted gay bloggers, among others, for assassination; on Sunday, authorities there detained thousands of suspected militants in a pre-emptive raid.

President Barack Obama called the shooting “an act of terror and an act of hate” and noted that it occurred during Pride festivities across the country, an annual celebration of the LGBT community.

“The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing and to live,” Obama said Sunday at the White House. “So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.”

Obama said that authorities have “no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer,” or “what — if any — inspiration or association this killer may have had with terrorist groups.”

The Islamic State claimed the gunman as one of its own: “The armed attack that targeted a gay nightclub in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida which left over 100 people dead or injured was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” the group’s Amaq agency said.

But Mateen’s father said his son never demonstrated much of an interest in radical Islamist doctrine or religion, though he had expressed anger recently over seeing two men kissing in Miami. And his ex-wife said Mateen had beat her and was mentally ill and unstable.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that a number of signs — including the Islamic State’s calls for attacks during Ramadan, the gunman’s declaration in his 911 call, and his targeting of a gay nightclub during Pride — indicated that the attack was “an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism.” He added: “Whether this attack was also ISIS-directed remains to be determined.”

Mateen was hardly unknown to federal authorities: The FBI investigated him on two separate occasions. In 2013, he came under suspicion for making inflammatory comments alleging he had ties to terrorists, but authorities could not find sufficient evidence to pin charges on him. Then, in 2014, the FBI looked at Mateen’s possible ties to a notorious figure, Moner Mohammad Abusalha, the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria.

The FBI concluded that the contact between the two men — who both lived in Fort Pierce, Florida — had been “minimal” and that Mateen “did not constitute a substantive threat at that time,” Ronald Hopper, assistant agent in charge of the FBI’s Tampa division, told reporters in Orlando.

Western governments have struggled to contain the fallout from hate-filled propaganda touting Islamist violence, even as the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate continues to shrink on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria, experts said.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi “knows if he calls for terror it will come,” said author Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “He doesn’t need any direct human connection or even a web connection. His message is so pervasive in the media and so simple it is certain to inspire the angry.”

There’s plenty of anger to stoke. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation are commonplace in the United States, but those attacks have not been on a large-scale or linked directly to foreign terrorist groups or their propaganda. A 1990 bombing of a gay bar in Greenwich Village in New York that injured three people was eventually blamed on a suspected Islamist terrorist.

According to the FBI’s most recent statistics, in 2014, hate crimes against gay Americans accounted for more than 18 percent of the 1,017 such incidents across the country, with about 2 percent occurring in gay bars or nightclubs.

Orlando’s tragedy threw the 2016 election into stark relief Sunday, drawing markedly different responses from the two presumptive presidential nominees, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state emphasized it was both terrorism and a hate crime, while Trump initially made no mention of the LGBT community and accepted “congratulations” from his Twitter followers for having foreseen an attack.

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,” the Republican tweeted. “We must be smart!” Later Sunday, he piled on, calling for the president’s resignation and for Clinton to drop out of the presidential race. In a final statement Sunday evening, he said, “Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans,” concluding, “We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.”

Trump’s campaign said he’ll give a speech Monday on the attack, immigration, and national security.

Clinton, a Democrat who has made national security central to her campaign, vowed to continue the Obama administration’s fight against the Islamic State and its ilk, stressing the role of multinational coalitions and the need to upend terrorist recruitment networks. “It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,” she said, promising as well to fight for the rights of the LGBT community.

“Hate has absolutely no place in America,” Clinton said. “To the LGBT community: Please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them.”

Beyond the politics of the presidential race, in Orlando, the attack has left a sense of disbelief, pain, and outrage.

“There’s a lot of anger,” Florida State Sen. Darren Soto, who represents Orlando, told Foreign Policy on Sunday. “Many of us woke up shocked to find our happy little town was the site of the largest mass shooting in American history.”

“We have a large and proud gay community here that’s a fundamental part of our culture, and for them to be targeted in a potentially international terrorist attack is just upsetting and mind-boggling.”",The Florida attack could mark a dangerous new tactic for Islamic State-inspired extremists — singling out the LGBT community in the West.

Officials are still investigating the exact motives for the shooting, and both ties to radical Islam as well as a general hate crime motivation are being considered.

Sources have confirmed to CBS News that authorities are investigating whether the suspect had ties to Islamic terrorism. Police have said the attack appears to be an act of domestic terrorism, and officials are investigating whether the attack may have been inspired or directed by a terrorism group like ISIS or Al Qaeda, CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues reports.

A U.S. intelligence source told CBS news senior investigative producer Pat Milton that Islamic terrorism is being investigated as a possible motive in the shooting because of several indicators, including the style of the attack, which had similarities to the attacks in Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March. The gunman put up a protracted gun battle with police and was heavily armed, the source said.

Sources tell Milton that authorities investigating the incident are still looking into whether the attack is a hate crime.

Authorities are at the suspect’s home in Port St. Lucie and will likely comb through his computer and cell phone and attempt to hone in on his online footprint. They’re investigating whether he was on a terrorism watchlist, which could shed light on a possible motive, Pegues reports.

Mateen has no apparent criminal history, according to sources.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the suspect was found with a handgun and an AR-15-style assault rifle. Grayson said all the victims were killed with a single assault-style rifle and that the slaying happened “very quickly.” Officials are also processing a van they say was driven by the suspect.

There’s no current indication that Mateen had accomplices, police say.

The shooting and hostage situation early Sunday morning at Pulse — which describes itself as “Orlando’s hottest gay bar” — left at least 50 people dead, including the gunman, and more than 50 injured, officials say.

Florida Rep. Alan Grayson said Mateen was an American citizen, though he said he has several family members who aren’t. CBS News has confirmed that Mateen was born in the U.S., is 29 and has Afghan parents.

“I think it’s more likely than not it was an ideologically motivated attack,” Grayson said.

The suspect’s father has spoken out to the media, saying his son was anti-gay and he doesn’t believe the attack was motivated by religion.

The FBI says they haven’t determined whether the massacre was a hate crime, but Grayson said he believes “it’s no coincidence that the attack took place where it did and when it did.”

“It might be that we’ve seen the commission of an awful hate crime last night,” Grayson said.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said an officer in full uniform was working extra duty at the club around 2 a.m. Sunday and heard reports of shots fired. He engaged the shooter, who went back inside the club and took hostages, Mina said. Clubgoers reported hearing multiple gunshots and fled amid a chaotic scene.

CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues reports the suspect walked into the club heavily armed. He had an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun.

There was some concern initially that the gunman may have had a suspicious device, but investigators now believe that was not the case.

About three hours later, Mina said a decision was made to rescue the hostages, and officials say the suspect exchanged gunfire with a SWAT team. Law enforcement used flash-bang grenades and a SWAT vehicle to storm the building and may have saved the lives of nearly 30 being held hostage, CBS News reports. The suspected gunman was shot dead.

The attack is now the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

Officials are trying to piece together a profile of who the suspect was.

The laws, whose sections included expanded background checks and bans on assault weapons, were stymied in Congress after staunch opposition from Republican lawmakers and gun-rights lobby groups.

The gunman, identified by authorities as Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida, was found dead inside the nightclub after a shootout with the police.

Then the suspect went back into the club to continue shooting and took hostages.

About three hours after the shooting first broke out, police shot and killed the suspect during actions to rescue the hostages.

""It appeared he was organised and well-prepared,"" said Orlando Police Chief John Mina at an earlier press conference, adding that the suspect had an assault-type weapon and a handgun.

Islamic State (IS) terrorist group has claimed the responsibility for the shootings.

Officials are still investigating the exact motives for the shooting, and both ties to radical Islam as well as a general hate crime motivation are being considered.

Sources have confirmed to CBS News that authorities are investigating whether the suspect had ties to Islamic terrorism. Police have said the attack appears to be an act of domestic terrorism, and officials are investigating whether the attack may have been inspired or directed by a terrorism group like ISIS or Al Qaeda, CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues reports.

A U.S. intelligence source told CBS news senior investigative producer Pat Milton that Islamic terrorism is being investigated as a possible motive in the shooting because of several indicators, including the style of the attack, which had similarities to the attacks in Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March. The gunman put up a protracted gun battle with police and was heavily armed, the source said.

Sources tell Milton that authorities investigating the incident are still looking into whether the attack is a hate crime.

Authorities are at the suspect’s home in Port St. Lucie and will likely comb through his computer and cell phone and attempt to hone in on his online footprint. They’re investigating whether he was on a terrorism watchlist, which could shed light on a possible motive, Pegues reports.

Mateen has no apparent criminal history, according to sources.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the suspect was found with a handgun and an AR-15-style assault rifle. Grayson said all the victims were killed with a single assault-style rifle and that the slaying happened “very quickly.” Officials are also processing a van they say was driven by the suspect.

There’s no current indication that Mateen had accomplices, police say.

The shooting and hostage situation early Sunday morning at Pulse — which describes itself as “Orlando’s hottest gay bar” — left at least 50 people dead, including the gunman, and more than 50 injured, officials say.

Florida Rep. Alan Grayson said Mateen was an American citizen, though he said he has several family members who aren’t. CBS News has confirmed that Mateen was born in the U.S., is 29 and has Afghan parents.

“I think it’s more likely than not it was an ideologically motivated attack,” Grayson said.

The suspect’s father has spoken out to the media, saying his son was anti-gay and he doesn’t believe the attack was motivated by religion.

The FBI says they haven’t determined whether the massacre was a hate crime, but Grayson said he believes “it’s no coincidence that the attack took place where it did and when it did.”

“It might be that we’ve seen the commission of an awful hate crime last night,” Grayson said.

Orlando Police Chief John Mina said an officer in full uniform was working extra duty at the club around 2 a.m. Sunday and heard reports of shots fired. He engaged the shooter, who went back inside the club and took hostages, Mina said. Clubgoers reported hearing multiple gunshots and fled amid a chaotic scene.

CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues reports the suspect walked into the club heavily armed. He had an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun.

There was some concern initially that the gunman may have had a suspicious device, but investigators now believe that was not the case.

About three hours later, Mina said a decision was made to rescue the hostages, and officials say the suspect exchanged gunfire with a SWAT team. Law enforcement used flash-bang grenades and a SWAT vehicle to storm the building and may have saved the lives of nearly 30 being held hostage, CBS News reports. The suspected gunman was shot dead.

The attack is now the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

Officials are trying to piece together a profile of who the suspect was. The FBI is leading the investigation and federal investigators are trying to determine who the suspect was in contact with in the days and hours leading up to the attack.","The suspected gunman behind a mass shooting at an Orlando nighclub has been identified as Port St. Lucie resident Omar Mateen, CBS News confirms."

Earlier that day, suspected attacker Omar Mateen killed at least 50 people and wounded dozens more at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Authorities are investigating the killings as an act of terror, as information continues to emerge on the attack.

Many of the leaders offering solidarity following the shooting in Orlando are from countries, such as France and Belgium, that have suffered their own horrific attacks recently.

Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was one of the first leaders to send out condolences on Twitter, saying he was ""deeply saddened."" In March, the self-described Islamic State group claimed a terror attack in Belgium's capital of Brussels that killed 32 people.

A number of members of Britain's government, including Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, tweeted out their support on Sunday. Khan, the city's first Muslim mayor, added the pro-LGBT rights hashtag ""#lovewins"" to his message of solidarity.

French President Francois Hollande, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and the official city of Paris Twitter account all voiced their support and sympathies for those affected by the killings in Orlando. An ISIS terror attack in Paris last November that targeted a number of locations, including the Bataclan concert hall, killed 130 people and injured hundreds.

Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Affairs Minister Borge Brende both sent out their condolences to the victims and families following the attack. Norway suffered a horrific mass shooting in 2011, when anti-Muslim terrorist Anders Behring Breivik killed 69 people -- the majority of them teenagers -- on the tiny island of Utoya.

Israeli President Reuven Rivlin called the attack ""cowardly"" on Twitter, and said his country stands with the United States. A terror attack in Tel Aviv, Israel, last week killed four people at a popular market, and wounded more than a dozen.

The official Twitter account of Tel Aviv also tweeted out a message of solidarity with Orlando and the LGBT community, showing Tel Aviv City Hall lit up in rainbow colors.

Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the United Nations, also condemned the attack and stood by victims, according to the U.N.'s official Twitter account.

From Berlin to Bangkok, gay and lesbian groups organised gatherings in solidarity with Americans after Sunday's massacre at a gay nightclub that left 49 people dead in the worst mass shooting in modern US history.

The Sydney Harbour Bridge was lit with the rainbow colours of the gay community flag as hundreds gathered to condemn terror and homophobia.

""This could have happened anywhere,"" Australian Paul Savage told AFP at a candlelit vigil for the victims on the busy strip that hosts Sydney's annual Mardi Gras pride march.

""He could easily have walked into a bar in Sydney,"" he said, pointing out that Australia's tighter gun laws were ""much more helpful"" in preventing the mass shootings that claim hundreds of lives each year in the United States.

- 'Could have been us' -

In Berlin, more than 100 people gathered outside the US embassy to lay flowers, light candles and wave rainbow flags.

Helmut Metzner, a leading member of the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, condemned what he called an attack on the global gay ""family"".

""It could have hit any single one of us,"" he told AFP, adding: ""We must stand united and defend our lifestyle and not back down. That is what the terrorists want, and that's a favour we won't do them.""

US President Barack Obama denounced the attack at the Pulse nightclub by slain shooter Omar Mateen, which also wounded 53, as ""an act of terror and an act of hate"".

In an outpouring of solidarity similar to that seen after the Paris and Brussels attacks, social media were awash with messages of support for the families of the victims.

Using hashtags such as #loveislove or #lovewins, many shared images of ribbons -- some black, others carrying the Stars and the Stripes of the US flag on one side and rainbow colours on the other.

Global landmarks were swathed in the colours of the rainbow, with Paris' Eiffel Tower set to follow suit Monday night after similar displays lit up New York's One World Trade Center and Sydney's iconic bridge.

""Paris is with Orlando,"" tweeted Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, which is still recovering from the November jihadist attacks in which 130 people were killed.

The Islamic State group, which was behind the Paris and Brussels attacks, also claimed responsibility for the Florida bloodshed.

Whether Mateen, a US national of Afghan origin who had homophobic tendencies, was part of a wider jihadist conspiracy, as claimed by IS, remains unclear.

German lawmaker Cem Ozdemir, co-chair of the left-leaning Greens Party, told AFP that whatever the outcome of the investigation, ""Islamism and homophobia are two sides of the same coin.""

In one of several vigils across the United States, hundreds gathered in New York's Greenwich Village on Sunday to leave flowers beside a sign reading ""Stop Hate"".

Despite the defiant tone struck at many of the gatherings, some people expressed fear.

""It does scare me a bit, being gay and working in a gay bar,"" admitted Saleem Khan, a 30-year-old barman in London's Soho district, the heart of the city's gay scene.

Obama said the FBI was investigating the latest in a string of mass gun killings in the United States ""as an act of terrorism"".

French President Francois Hollande reacted ""with horror"" to the attack, which threatens to increase anti-migrant hostility in Europe where populist xenophobic parties are on the rise as the continent struggles with its worst migration crisis since World War II.

The prime minister of Belgium, where 32 people were killed in jihadist attacks on Brussels' airport and metro in March, also sent his condolences.

""Although such deadly attacks cause profound sadness in us, we are resolved to continue with our open and tolerant lifestyle,"" she said on the sidelines of a visit to China.

The condemnation was echoed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has cracked down on gay pride events.

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller told City News Service “we are assisting the Santa Monica Police Department with the arrest of an individual,” but would not supply any more details.

Unnamed police officials told the Los Angeles Times there was white explosive powder in the car.

A City News Service editor described a white Acura sedan, parked on the wrong side of a street with its doors open, in Santa Monica, surrounded by police lines.

Next to the car was a gas can, some camouflage gear and a backpack. Reporters could spot Indiana license plates and it was covered with insect debris, as if it had been recently driven a great distance cross-country.

There was no bomb squad present, and police told the Los Angeles Times the person arrested was in town for the Pride Festival, and had a security guard’s uniform.

Sheriff’s deputies said a man “was detained in the city of Santa Monica this morning, who was in possession of weapons and other dangerous material.

“Any possible nexus with this individual and the Pride event in West Hollywood is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” said the sheriff’s department, which is the city police agency for West Hollywood.

Santa Monica police would not officially confirm the incident, or link it to the Pride Festival underway this weekend at the center of gay, lesbian and transgender life in Southern California.

The Los Angeles Times reports that Santa Monica police had responded to a report of a prowler on 17th Street south of Olympic Boulevard in Santa Monica, 7 miles away from the Pride Day festival.

They encountered a man dressed in camouflage who said he was waiting for a friend. His car, with Indiana plates, was searched, and material described as pipe bomb materials was seized.

“He was totally unrelated” to the Florida attack, said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.

Sheriff’s deputies in West Hollywood said the man did not have any apparent connection with the Florida mass murder. Fifty people were killed and 53 injured in the attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, an attack carried out by an apparent ISIS terrorist.","A man with explosives and guns was seized in Santa Monica after a mass killing in Florida and hours before 400,000 were expected for the Gay Pride Parade."

Authorities are still piecing together the details of the attack, but the shooter, Omar Mateen, was apparently inspired by the so-called Islamic State group and had expressed anti-gay sentiments in the past.

After local authorities put out a call for blood to help care for the injured, massive lines formed to donate at local blood banks. The banks quickly reached capacity but urged people return in the coming days, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

""It's hard to believe ... You have to do something to help. You can't stay home,"" a local 69-year-old man, Frank Tiffany, told the Sentinel.

While rules for gay men who want to donate blood have lessened, many have expressed anguish that they are not able to help in that manner.

After the shooting, Equality Florida, a local LGBT civil rights organization, started a GoFundMe page to collect donations to help the victims. ""We are heartbroken and angry that senseless violence has once again destroyed lives in our state and in our country,"" the group wrote.

Donations have flooded in. As of about 3 p.m. EDT, Equality Florida had collected more than $200,000. You can find that fund by clicking here. CrowdRise has also set up a microsite to help victims and to raise money for related charities. You can find that here. The nonprofit organization Planting Peace has also started a CrowdRise fund that is raising money for victims.

An LGBT community center in Orlando coordinated a response with local organizations, setting up a hotline and a site with grief counselors. The hotline's number is 407-228-1446.

""We stand united to provide every resource to our friends and family in the wake of this senseless act,"" the GLBT Community Center of Central Florida wrote.",How to help the victims of Orlando’s deadly mass shooting.

Security at the pride festival in West Hollywood has been stepped up following the arrest which authorities say has no connections with the biggest mass shooting in US history in Florida.

Santa Monica Police arrested the man early on Sunday morning after receiving reports of a suspected prowler, a law enforcement source told the LA Times.

The man told officers he was waiting for a friend but a search of the car uncovered weapons,ammunition and tannerite, which can be used to make a pipe bomb.

The LA Times clams that on arrests the man made comment that he was in town for a pride event in West Hollywood.

The Santa Monica investigation has been now taken over by the FBI.

Santa Monica Police spokesman Saul Rodriguez confirmed that the suspect was from Indiana and that weapons were found in the car.

A city official in West Hollywood stressed that officials were stepping up security at the gay pride event.

""We must be smart.

""What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.

Mr Trump has proposed a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the United States as a way to combat the threat of radical Islamist attacks.

From Berlin to Bangkok, gay and lesbian groups organised gatherings in solidarity with Americans after Sunday's massacre at a gay nightclub that left 49 people dead in the worst mass shooting in modern US history.

The Sydney Harbour Bridge was lit with the rainbow colours of the gay community flag as hundreds gathered to condemn terror and homophobia.

""This could have happened anywhere,"" Australian Paul Savage told AFP at a candlelit vigil for the victims on the busy strip that hosts Sydney's annual Mardi Gras pride march.

In Berlin, more than 100 people gathered outside the US embassy to lay flowers, light candles and wave rainbow flags.

Helmut Metzner, a leading member of the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany, condemned what he called an attack on the global gay ""family"".

""It could have hit any single one of us,"" he told AFP, adding: ""We must stand united and defend our lifestyle and not back down. That is what the terrorists want, and that's a favour we won't do them.""

US President Barack Obama denounced the attack at the Pulse nightclub by slain shooter Omar Mateen, which also wounded 53, as ""an act of terror and an act of hate"".

In an outpouring of solidarity similar to that seen after the Paris and Brussels attacks, social media were awash with messages of support for the families of the victims.

Using hashtags such as #loveislove or #lovewins, many shared images of ribbons -- some black, others carrying the Stars and the Stripes of the US flag on one side and rainbow colours on the other.

Remember: Radical Islam is the cancer of the human race.

We will keep you posted. There are rumors of the shooter wearing a suicide vest, among other news slowly trickling out. Three days ago, ISIS released a propaganda video promising a Florida attack. It is not clear if Mateen had ties to them, or merely saw the propaganda on the internet and decided to make it come true.

This is breaking news as I type this. Normally, I’m not comfortable writing about stories that are still unfolding, but here’s what we know so far: There are 50 people dead at this point (not 20, as written above), with over 42 in the hospital, condition unknown. Mateen started shooting, and then took hostages before the SWAT cops were able to storm the place and end his miserable life.

Mateen was armed with an assault rifle, a handgun, and what was feared to be an improvised explosive device. Mateen entered Pulse club around 2 a.m. Sunday morning and began shooting. After most of the 320 people there escaped, Mateen took hostages from a group that was hiding in a bathroom. Shortly before 6 a.m., a SWAT unit breached the club and engaged Mateen in what’s being called a protracted gun battle. Mateen was killed.

Omar Mateen of Port Saint Luice, Florida has been identified as the gunman who killed 20 people at a Orlando nightclub, CBS News, the Washington Post, and NBC News report, citing law enforcement officials. Mateen is a U.S. citizen; his parents are from Afghanistan, CBS News reports. FBI Agent Ron Hopper told reporters Mateen may have leanings towards Islamic extremism.

Luckily, the V.A. has solved all other problems:

In my opinion, this is medical malpractice. Please read a much longer article on my thoughts of transgenderism. I recently re-read it, and I would change nothing. As I explained then, I was on the fence about a grown-ass American who wanted to use their own money to change themselves into something they clearly are not. But now, there are two new developments that are alarming. One is the increase in giving little children hormone therapy and surgeries. This shouldn’t even be a gray area: If a doctor chooses to give a child under 18 hormone therapy and plastic surgery of any kind, he should have his license taken away and he should be put in jail. The parents should be right next to him. This is child abuse. We know that the vast majority of children who think they are transgender eventually grow out of it. The fact that this is going on with the approval of left-leaning individuals is shocking to me.

The second new development, and more relevant to this conversation, is how the state is becoming involved. This is new. This is your tax money. First, we had the state of California approvingly paying for transgender surgeries (take your Orwellian “gender confirmation surgery” phrasing and die), and now we have Veterans Affairs, which can’t even take care of the vets it already has, considering spending billions in tax money. I was worried about the medical ethics of this with someone doing it with their own money, but hey, this is America, after all. But the rest of us having to pay for it? HELL NAH. And Veteran’s Affairs, which can’t even take care of our combat vets, wants to spend hundreds of millions of dollars mutilating an intact man into a man without a penis? GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

I’ve been thinking about some things lately. Maybe it’s me, you know? Maybe it’s ME who is the crazy one, and it is everyone else who is sane. From what I’ve seen, there’s been little to no pushback on the sudden all-important topic of transgenderism, so I must be the one who is getting left behind. I’m 41 years old now, and obviously I’m turning into that old guy shaking my cane on my porch, lamenting the shoes that the kids are wearing these days and the playing of their rock and roll records, right?

Because honestly, I don’t want to be that guy. You know the one: The guy who seizes on some perceived outrage, and won’t talk about anything else? But every goddamn week I feel like I’m really living in an alternate universe. For thousands and thousands of years, it was an accepted truth that if you had a penis, you were a boy. If you had a vagina, you were a girl. We taught our kids that before they got out of second grade, right?

Now? Everything was fine until like ten minutes ago, and now our lame-duck president has decided that men not being allowed to shower in the girl’s locker room is JUST LIKE black people not being able to sit down at a lunch counter next to a white woman. With the speed of a hurricane, this new truth, that men with penises can be called women, and vice versa, has swept through the country so fast that much of the land has hardly seemed to even take notice that it’s happening. But happen it did, and to even raise one’s hand and say “This is insane” is to be labeled a bigot.

I don’t care anymore. Call me whatever you want. Because, unlike this doofus columnist from the Washington Post, I am NOT placing myself on the side of what makes sense. As always, this is my opinion, and my opinion only; I’m just some asshole with a keyboard. Gather around, my gender-struggling fellow Americans. I am going to tell you something now that you need to hear, something that not one of our corrupted institutions will tell you. These institutions, including academia, Hollywood, the mainstream media, government, and now, even the military, lack the backbone to tell you what you desperately need to hear:

If you are born a man, you will never be a woman. If you are born a woman, you will never be a man.

That’s it. I do not say this out of hatred, malice, or bigotry. I’m actually trying to do you a favor, because everyone else is to cowed to say otherwise. Because I think you should be able to do whatever you want on your own dime, and in your free time (mostly). Because I will fight to the DEATH to ensure your civil rights of freedom of speech, the freedom to vote, and the right to bear arms are never impeded, and that you can live in dignity. Because I believe that nobody should be persecuted religiously, physically, or mentally. Because I believe that, yes, people are born this way, and that you cannot help what you are and how you feel inside. Because I feel compassion for the inner struggle that people who are born a certain way must go through life. This is why I tell you these things.

In my opinion, men and women who believe they are born in the wrong body will benefit far more from counseling and learning to accept who they are, instead of having a plastic surgeon mutilating their precious body into something it isn’t, and will never be. I wish I was a foot taller, could run like Usain Bolt, and had a tapir penis. But that’s NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. Your body is a gift. Learn to be happy with it.

And hey, if you want to wear a dress, makeup, all the rest? I have zero problem with it. I think it’s your right as an American to be whatever kind of person you want. If society sees that as weird, it doesn’t matter. We’re all weird, in a way. And if it’s a sexual thing, I could care less. God knows, my will states that my brother JK must immediately take possession of my hard drive and DESTROY it before my parents see it. But for the love of GOD, do not chop anything off or stuff fake parts into yourself. After all, you may change your goddamn mind. Then you’re screwed.

The reality is this: The vast, vast, VAST majority of post-op transgenders will never resemble anything like a woman. Believe me, I’ve seen them coming out of the VA with high heels and short shorts already. You know what they look like? MEN. Men with inappropriate short pants on. Caitlyn Jenner has spent millions of dollars and countless hours going under the knife, and he still looks like a man from a mile away. Those who do resemble their particular sex needed to fill their bodies with chemicals beyond count, and will for the rest of their lives. Many of those chemicals have side effects that we still don’t understand or can’t counteract. Most transgenders will never have access to those types of resources for that sort of lifetime treatment. And the U.S. government certainly goddamn doesn’t. I firmly stand against the VA on this one.

Follow me on Twitter as I shame soulless corporate America:

It is America’s good fortune that the nation has men of this caliber serving in its military. Buentello didn’t stop to think, he leapt into action because he saw children in trouble. Absolutely extraordinary. The family has set up a GoFundMe campaign, which you can visit right here. They’re still a little short of their goal; let’s help put them over the top.

Former military leaders want your guns, peasants:

Here’s the thing you have to know about the NRA. For argument’s sake, I will refer to them as conservative-leaning organization. Unlike other conservative-leaning organizations, the NRA fights every “reasonable” change to their worldview tooth and freaking nail. It’s like Reagan, when he pushed for amnesty for illegal immigrants in the 1980s, when everyone assured him that that would be the end of the problem, and they were totally going to super-duper secure the border right after that. A few decades and trillions of dollars later, we have MILLIONS of illegal immigrants in the country. See where I’m going? It’s the old “camel/nose/tent” proverb on steroids.

That’s why people scratch their heads when the NRA refuses to accept even the so-called “common-sense” gun laws, because they know what it leads to. And that, in itself, is a form of defense. Gun-grabbers know that every tiny, innocuous law is going to be fought tooth and nail. That’s why, many times, these laws just die in committee. Even the people who sponsor them know they’re in for a brutal fight, every time.

As a civil liberties advocate, that’s all fine with me. Frankly, the fact that David “Loverboy” Petraeus and Stanley “This is off the record, right?” McChrystal agreed to this blows my mind. There’s something in the water in D.C., I’m convinced. It’s as though once people get there, they turn into ginormous anti-civil rights fucks. The most staunch, fire-breathing right-winger turns into Ruth Bader Ginsberg after a few years in D.C. It’s extraordinary. Is this a fear of not being invited to the right cocktail party, or what?

After annihilating Bernie Sanders in the Roundup two weeks ago, he promptly got cornholed in the California by Hillary Clinton. Coincidence? Probably.

Nevertheless, I promised an unvarnished look at all of the candidates, and that’s what we’ll do. So let’s take Dr. Sheehan’s advice and let’s look back at the history of Mrs. Clinton.

Remember the time that Clinton, with zero trading experience, turned $1,000 into $100,000 trading that totally mainstream and not at all obscure financial vehicle of “cattle futures?” SHE’S A WHIZ.

Remember the time Clinton took all of those women that had accused husband Bill of rape/sexual harassment/groping over the years and dragged their names through the mud? She was front and center as the leader of the defense to tear them down.

Remember when she was acting Secretary of State and accepted tens of millions in bribe money from despotic regimes like Saudi Arabia in exchange for ignoring their many human rights violations? Even left-wingers were calling her out for that bullshit. Oh, and she’s not just in foreign governments’ hip pockets. She likes to help out her friends as well.

Remember when she was taking money from a fugitive and career criminal?

Remember when she had a bunch of long-serving, competent people in the travel office fired so she could install some of her incompetent friends?

Remember when she had her stooges strong-arm the FBI into conducting secret background checks on Republicans that she deemed enemies?

Remember the time that she lied to the faces of the families of the dead contractors and ambassador to Libya, claiming a YouTube video was responsible for their deaths when she knew perfectly well that it was a planned terrorist attack? Oh, and then she lied about lying, and called the families liars. Nice.

Remember when she violated rules concerning the handling of classified material? Violations that would land me, you, and anyone else NOT named Hillary Clinton in a federal penitentiary?

I could go on…and on…and on. You know, a good percentage of the country didn’t even know who Bernie Sanders was like six months ago. But Hillary? She’s been with us for decades now, leaving a trail of slimy goo from Arkansas, to the White House, to New York, and now all over the country as she attempts to take her pantsuit back to the oval office. I know exactly what she is and what she’s all about. I have personal knowledge of how she conducts herself around people she deems “lesser.” My contractor buddies who have been lucky enough to drive her around tell me she’s a raging monster.

And that is backed up by many other stories now coming out. Say what you will about George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and I’ve said plenty about both, but these two men, by all accounts, are gentlemen who mostly treat others with respect and a polite demeanor. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, is a monster. Like I’ve said in the past, I’d vote for Joe Stalin’s rotting corpse before I vote for this corrupt hack. So you know what that means. Next week, it’s Trump’s turn.

DAYUM. Yes, I know it’s New Zealand’s navy. Let them have this one, OK? The only thing that Americans know about New Zealand is that they have a lot of sheep and it’s where hobbits come from. Frankly, I didn’t even know that they had a navy. Kudos to them. That wave would make me poo myself. I hate boats. And storms.

Bro: You can’t brandish weapons at people and tell them that you are going to disappear their bodies. Although I’ll admit it: I chuckled for a second at the bacon thing. ONLY FOR A SECOND. Racists.

The only crime here is a crime against comedy:

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee went so far as to say Obama should “step down” for not using the term and Clinton should “get out of this race” if she won’t either.

“If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said in a statement. “Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen -- and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.”

Obama, speaking from the White House on Sunday, said the nightclub massacre in which 50 people were killed and at least 53 others were wounded is being investigated as an “act of terror,” though did not say whether it was tied to radical Islam.

The gunman, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, was heard shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News.

Mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Fox News has learned.

ISIS reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, though it’s unclear if the shooting was actually directed by the group or only inspired by it.

All these details, surrounding the deadliest terror attack on the U.S. homeland since 9/11, have fueled tensions in the presidential race at an already-combustible time.

Trump has faced intense criticism from members of both parties for his calls to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the U.S.

In the wake of the Orlando attack, Trump again defended his proposals, saying on Twitter: “What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough.”

Trump originally was planning to deliver a speech Monday in Manchester, N.H., focused on the Clintons.

In the wake of the Orlando attack, it will also focus on security and immigration issues, Fox News is told.

Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders also condemned the attack, while speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt.

Earlier Sunday, Clinton released a statement unequivocally calling the massacre an “act of terror.”

“For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home. It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,” she said.

She also called it an “act of hate” -- a term Obama also used -- since the attacker targeted an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. And she said the country needs to “keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.”

Meanwhile, a joint campaign rally with Clinton and Obama set for Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., has been postponed in light of the attack, according to a White House official.

Obama also ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff “as a mark of respect for the victims of the act of hatred and terror perpetrated on Sunday, June 12, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.”

Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, which will make additional resources available for local authorities.

He offered “thoughts and prayers” to all those affected by the attack, particularly the victims and their families, and praised the efforts of the first-responders.","The terror massacre at a packed Orlando nightclub reverberated across the presidential campaign trail Sunday, as the candidates condemned the deadliest shooting in U.S. history -- and Donald Trump ripped President Obama and Hillary Clinton for avoiding the term “radical Islam” in doing so."

“As Americans we are united in grief and in outrage and in resolve to defend our people,” Obama said, as he noted that gunman Omar Mateen‘s motivations are not fully known, while he directed the FBI to “spare no effort” to find any terrorism associations.

“This is sobering reminder that attacks on any American – regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation – is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country,” Obama said. “No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.”

Obama made the brief address at around 2 p.m., after meeting with FBI Director James Comey.

Vice President Biden canceled his trip to Miami to fundraise for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and instead will return to Washington.

Obama, recalling previous mass shootings, said the massacre was a reminder of how easy it is “for someone to get their hands on a weapon that allows them to shoot people in a school, in a house of worship, or in a movie theater or in a nightclub.

“We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

Obama directed flags to be lowered to honor the victims and called for Americans to reject hate.

“In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,” Obama said. “We will not give into fear or turn against each other, instead we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people and defend our nation and to take action against those who threaten us.”

Meanwhile, Donald Trump took to Twitter Sunday to say he was “right” about warning about the danger of radical Islamic extremists — but didn’t want his supporters to pat him on the back.

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!,” tweeted Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslims from entering the US and the destruction of ISIS.

Mateen, 29, had been on the FBI’s radar as an ISIS sympathizer and called 911 to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group prior to a shootout with police. Mateen opened fire around 2 a.m. Sunday at Pulse nightclub, an LGBT hot spot, in a rampage that killed 50 and injured at least 53.

Trump also called on Obama to resign for not mentioning Islamist extremism.

“Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn’t he should immediately resign in disgrace!”

“@realDonaldTrump You’re congratulating yourself because 50 people are dead this morning in a horrific tragedy?” tweeted Meghan McCain, daughter of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).

Meanwhile, top Trump surrogate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) also called for tougher screenings of Muslims coming into the United States.

“It certainly looks like another one of the extremist attacks, Islamic extremism,” Sessions (R-Ala.) told Fox News Sunday.

Sessions said the rampage will mean “further movement in the direction Donald Trump has set forth.”

“It’s not stopping, as we see apparently today,” Sessions said. “More of these attacks are coming. It’s a real part of the threat that we face. … We need to slow down and be careful about those we admit into the country.”

Democrats quickly called for stricter gun control after police said Mateen use an AR-15 style-rifle along with a handgun during the slaughter.

“He had an AR-15, an assault weapon,” New York Sen. Charles Schumer said Sunday. “It is very easy to get these kinds of guns in Florida. … We have to get tougher on guns. We can’t have incident after incident after incident after incident. And in this country it is so easy for so many people to get these kinds of assault weapons whose only purpose is to shoot a whole lot of people.”

Similar to Obama, Hillary Clinton on Sunday called the shooting an “act of terror” and “also an act of hate” against the LGBT community during Pride Month.

The presumptive Democratic nominee also urged more gun control saying the massacre reminds “us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders also called for an assault weapons ban.

“We should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people,” the Democratic presidential candidate told “Meet the Press.”","WASHINGTON — President Obama called the shooting rampage that left 50 dead at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando “an act of terror and an act of hate,” in a five-minute address Sunday afterno…"

Supported by a friend, a man weeps for victims of the mass shooting just a block from the scene in Orlando, Florida | Gregg Newton/AFP via Getty Images In the worst mass-shooting in U.S. history, a gunman stormed a popular gay nightclub in Orlando, murdered at least 50 people and injured as many as 53 others before he was gunned down early Sunday in an intense firefight with police. The shooter was identified as Omar Mateen, a concealed-weapons permit holder who worked in the security industry and lived roughly 130 miles away in Port St. Lucie. State records show he was registered to vote in 2006, but skipped the elections that year. A registered Democrat, he voted in the March 15 presidential primary. Officials said they were treating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and some indicated Mateen might have been inspired by ISIS, the Islamic terrorist group which later in the day claimed that the attack was carried out by one of its fighters.

FBI special-agent-in-charge Ron Hooker told reporters that Mateen had been interviewed twice in 2013 after he made comments to co-workers about potential ties to terror groups, and another time in 2014. The second time was because he had a tie to a man named Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American suicide bomber who in 2014 drove a truck full of explosives into a government building in Syria. The gunman’s father said “this has nothing to do with religion” and that his son was anti-gay. Abusalha was from Indian River County, which borders St. Lucie County. Hooker said Mateen had contact with Abusalha, but no “substantive relationship” was found, he said. He also confirmed that Mateen did call 911 just prior to the shooting to proclaim “allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State.” An Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms official also said that two weapons used in the attack were purchased legally. Mateen has a “statewide firearm license,” state records show. Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News on Sunday that “this has nothing to do with religion” and that his son was anti-gay.

“We were in Downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music. And he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry,” Seddique told the network. “They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said, ‘Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that.’ And then we were in the men’s bathroom and men were kissing each other.” Seddique is a native of Afghanistan. His son, born in New York, changed his name in 2006 from Omar Mir Seddique to Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, NBC first reported. The reasons for the name change were unclear. Seddiqe said the family is “in shock like the whole country.” The shooting at Pulse Orlando occurred at the height of Pride Month and just after Gay Days in Disney World. He was shot and killed after SWAT teams stormed the nightclub to rescue hostages at 5 a.m. Sunday morning. Gunfire initially erupted in the club at about 2 a.m., officials said. The suspect was armed with at least one pistol and a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the suspect also might have been armed with a “some type of device on him.” Hours after the tragedy, Gov. Rick Scott promptly declared a state of emergency as local, state and national officials continued their investigation and began to update the grim body count. The death total surpasses the 32 who died in the 2007 shooting on the Virginia Tech campus, and the 28 who died in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. “My prayers are with the victims’ families & all those affected by the shooting in Orlando,” Scott tweeted. “We will devote every resource available to assist.”

In the aftermath of the attack a partisan divide emerged among Florida’s congressional and legislative delegations. Democrats urged the need to pass gun control measures — specifically, limiting high-volume magazines — and Republicans spoke more about the potential threat of radical Islam. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said, “I have checked with intelligence staff and they do believe there is some connection to ISIS. But I must say that is not official.” His Republican counterpart in the Senate, Marco Rubio, sits on the Select Committee on Intelligence and suggested in a CNN interview that Mateen might have at least been inspired by radical Islam. One Republican official in another state, Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick, ignited a related controversy on Sunday morning by tweeting a photo with a quote from Galatians 6:7 that read, “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.” The blowback on Twitter was fierce, and Patrick deleted the tweet. “This is reprehensible,” said former Florida Democratic Party chairman Bob Poe, who is running for the newly drawn 10th congressional district where the shooting happened. Poe, who is gay, made news Friday by announcing he is a longtime HIV survivor. “Hate speech is hate speech,” Poe said, drawing a parallel between Patrick’s statement and those who would be inspired to violence or bias against gay people. “Any fanaticism is dangerous.” One of Poe’s Democratic rivals for the seat, state Sen. Geraldine Thompson, already represents Orlando and said at a news conference that lawmakers need to consider more gun-safety measures. A third candidate for the district is former Orlando Police Chief Val Demings. Her husband, Orange County Sheriff Jeffrey Demings, said his agency views the attack as “a domestic terror incident.”

“This was an act of terror and hate,” President Barack Obama said later Sunday, offering sympathy for the victims and support for the investigation. At The Center in Orlando, which provides HIV testing and is a hub for the LGBT community, officials opened the doors Sunday morning and put out a call for grief counselors and therapists to donate services, Rob Domenico, a board director of The Center, told POLITICO Florida. “What makes our LGBTQ community unique is we have a pretty unified community,” Domenico said. “We’re in Pride month. We just had Gay Days at Disney and we’re united with an accepting straight community. But unfortunately, some people are threatened by that.” Earlier Sunday, Domenico expressed displeasure with the “ridiculous” ban on sexually active gay men from donating blood. Still, Central Floridians streamed to local blood banks and lines of donors formed around the block at one facility. As the community mourned and officials gathered more information, Rubio cautioned that this type of attack could be the work of a solo gunman who may or may not have coordinated with an organized terror group. “Basically the use of a handgun to storm a night club and start shooting people — it doesn’t take a tremendous amount of coordination,” he said. “You don’t need a phone call from Afghanistan or an email from Syria to tell you to go do this.”

Rubio also noted that radical Islamists have a history of brutal violence against gays. “We’ve seen it’s punishable by death. We’ve seen some horrifying pronouncements and things that they’ve done,” he said. “So if this crime … is one inspired by radical Islamic ideology, it is quite frankly not surprising that they would target this community in this horrifying way.” Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican who chairs the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, told ABC News that he thought it was telling that law enforcement was so quick to imply ties to Islamic extremism. “I think it’s significant the FBI said they are at least somewhat leaning toward ISIS support,” he said. “They have a capacity to reach out and lure in lone wolves.” Florida Democrat Rep. Alcee Hastings of Miramar said that he has no confidence Congress will take any action. “One thing I can guarantee you is that Congress will do nothing, not a damn thing, after this horrible shooting. If Congress couldn’t do anything after Sandy Hook, when all those innocent children, were killed, this unfortunately will not change minds in Congress.”",Father of suspect says his son was anti-gay.

It was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history and, in addition to the deaths, left more than 50 hospitalized.

The shooter has been identified as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old from Port St. Lucie, Florida. Officials have said they're investigating whether the massacre was an act of terrorism.

Ronald Hopper of the FBI said Mateen was an American citizen. He was not under surveillance at the time of the shooting.

Hooper said Mateen purchased at least two firearms legally within about the past week. State records show Mateen held a firearms license since at least 2011. It was set to expire in September 2017.

Some 911 calls involving the shooter and the massacre have become federal evidence, Matten said, adding that the conversations involved the Islamic State.



Hooper said Mateen in 2013 made inflammatory comments to co-workers and Mateen was interviewed twice. Hooper calls those interviews inconclusive.



In 2014, Hooper said, officials found Mateen had ties to an American suicide bomber. Hooper described the contact as minimal and not constituting a threat at that time.



Mateen's ex-wife on Sunday said he beat her repeatedly while they were married. The woman, who wasn't named in the report, told The Washington Post that she met Mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida and marry him. She said at first the marriage was normal, but then he became abusive.



They were together for a few months then her parents intervened when learning Mateen had assaulted her. She said he wasn't very religious and gave no signs of radical Islam. She said he owned a small-caliber handgun and worked as a guard at a nearby facility for juvenile delinquents.



She said his family was from Afghanistan, but her ex-husband was born in New York. His family later moved to Florida.



Officials confirmed that Mateen was a security guard with G4S. In a 2012 newsletter, the firm identified him as working in West Palm Beach.



In a statement sent to the Palm Beach Post, the security company confirmed his employment.



""We are shocked and saddened by the tragic event that occurred at the Orlando nightclub. We can confirm that Omar Mateen had been employed with G4S since September 10, 2007. We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends, families and people affected by this unspeakable tragedy.""



Multiple news outlets are reporting that the man who killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando called 911 shortly before the attack and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. The media outlets cited unnamed law enforcement officials in their reports.



Danny Banks, an agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said authorities are investigating whether the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history was an act of domestic or international terrorism, and if the shooter acted alone.





Mateen's father told NBC News that his son recently got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami and said that might be related to the assault.



Mir Seddique said he's in shock and that he wasn't aware of anything his son might have been planning.



""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident,"" Seddique said. ""We are in shock like the whole country.""



The father also says the incident has nothing to do with religion.

Seddique, a native of Afghanistan, appears on a television program broadcast on a California channel.

The show is known for ""its anti-US tirades"" and ""pro-Taliban"" remarks that are broadcast in the Dari language, according to a former Afghan official. The official spoke only on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be linked to coverage of the shooting.

The official said Seddique's ""Durand Jirga Show"" is anti-Pakistan. The name of the show references the Durand line, the long disputed border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Seddique campaigned in the United States for current Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who appeared on his program in 2014. The program's studio has an address in Fort Pierce, Florida.","The shooter has been identified as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old from Port St. Lucie, Florida.

His short statement made specific mention of the LGBTQ community, as well as as another call for more gun control. “The shooter was apparently armed with a hand gun and a powerful assault rifle,” he said. “This massacre is, therefore, a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or in a house of worship or a movie theater or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.”

Democratic Senator Robert Casey said he would announce a bill on Monday that would ban anyone convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime from owning a firearm. Under current law, those with felony convictions are prohibited from buying or possessing a gun, but those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes are not. Casey planned to make the announcement in his home state of Pennsylvania after a meeting with members of Pittsburgh's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Lawmakers, including some Republicans, have sought some gun restrictions after earlier mass shootings, but even minor changes failed to gain enough support to become law. Backed by the powerful gun lobby, many members of Congress see controls of weapons sales as a threat to Americans' constitutional rights. Other Democrats also called for Congress to act after Sunday's attack in Orlando, some in strong terms. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the killings would prompt debate but not action. ""The bottom line is that we allow dangerous people to buy guns in America and that has got to change,"" he said. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said the ""epidemic"" of gun violence would continue if Congress does not act and also said lawmakers shared responsibility. ""Congress has become complicit in these murders by its total, unconscionable deafening silence,"" he said in a statement. ""This doesn't have to happen but this epidemic will continue without end if Congress continues to sit on its hands and do nothing – again."" A gunman killed 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in Murphy's home state, Connecticut, in 2012. The suspected Orlando attacker, identified as Omar Mateen, 29, a U.S. citizen who was the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, was carrying an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun, authorities said. The shooter in Newtown also had an AR-15. Many Republicans, including the presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, focused on the threat from Islamist militants after the shooting, citing reports that Mateen was inspired by Islamic State. The FBI said Mateen had twice been interviewed after making comments to co-workers indicating he supported militant groups, but neither led to evidence of criminal activity.

The woman also told of how Omar Mateen enjoyed going to the gym, owned a small-caliber handgun and worked as a security guard

The ex-wife of the shooter who killed 50 people at a Florida gay club has described how he repeatedly beat her during their marriage.

The woman - who wishes to remain anonymous - wed 29-year-old security guard Omar Mateen in Port St Lucie seven years ago, according to records.

However, their marriage was plagued with violence, with Mateen allegedly beating his wife on a frequents basis for reasons like 'the laundry wasn't finished'.

Speaking on the condition on anonymity over fears she could be targeted, the woman told of how she first met New York-born Mateen online eight years ago.

She then decided to move to Florida to be with him.

At first, their marriage appeared normal, before Mateen's temper became increasingly worse and he turned to violence, she said.

“He was not a stable person,” said the ex-wife.

“He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that.”

She said Mateen's parents were originally from Afghanistan, but he was born in New York - something that FBI officials have confirmed.

His family later moved to Florida.

The pair married in March 2009 and moved into a two-bedroom apartment in Fort Pierce that Mateen’s family owned.

“He seemed like a normal human being,” the ex-wife said, adding that he wasn’t very religious at the time and worked out at the gym often.

She said in the few months they were married, Mateen - believed to be an ISIS sympathiser - gave no signs of having fallen under the sway of radical Islam.

The woman added he owned a small-caliber handgun and worked as a guard at a nearby facility for juvenile delinquents.

Pictures posted on Myspace show several selfies taken by Mateen wearing New York Police Department shirts in a couple of the shots.

The ex-wife was freed from her marriage after several months when her parents discovered the abuse.

Her father flew down to Fort Pierce to take her from the marital home leaving all her belongings behind.

Despite repeated attempts by Mateen to contact her she has not spoke to him since she left.

“They literally saved my life,” she said of her parents.

The two formally divorced in 2011, court records show.

After learning about what happened in the shootings, she said: “I am still processing. I am definitely lucky.”

According to Mateen's family, he has a three-year-old son.

During today's attack, the young man allegedly killed 50 people and injured 53 others at the Pulse club in Orlando.

He entered the venue shortly before 2am local time (6am GMT), where hundreds of revellers were partying, police say.

Armed with an assault rifle and a handgun, he then took terrified victims hostage before opening fire, showering the venue in a hail of bullets.

Mateen is believed to have been part of the radical Islam movement, but apparently was not on a terrorism watchlist at the time of today's shooting.

However, the suspect - who was shot dead in the attack - was reportedly being investigated over an unrelated crime, the details of which remain unclear.

When asked if Mateen had a link to radical Islamic terrorism, FBI agent Ron Hopper told journalists there were 'suggestions' he had 'leanings towards that'.

A congressman later said the attack is believed to have been 'ISIS-related'.

Detectives are investigating the background of the gunman, who is thought to have specifically targeted a gay club after seeing two men kissing in another city.

According to TMZ, Mateen, whose parents are both Afghan, possessed a Florida security officer licence and a state firearms licence.

This afternoon, Mateen's dad apologised for his son’s actions, saying he believed he carried out the killings after seeing two gay men kissing in Miami two months ago.

Speaking to NBC News, he said: “We are saying we are apologising for the whole incident.

“We were not aware of the actions he was taking.

“We are in shock like the whole of the country.

“This had nothing to do with religion.”

Earlier today, an Islamic State-affiliated Twitter account posted a photo it claimed to be of Mateen.

Accounts linked to the terror group were also seen celebrating the attack, which left dozens of unsuspecting revellers injured - some critically.

An ISIS twitter account showed a number of pictures of gay men being killed by the terror group.

The group also used a hashtag with the word Pulse, and said it would 'slay everyone of you o disbeliever'.

This evening, ISIS claimed responsibility for the shooting via Amaq News Agency, which is close to the terror group.

Mateen was apparently well-prepared for today's attack, carrying the assault rifle, a handgun and at least one suspicious device - believed to be a suicide vest.

During a press conference this afternoon, police confirmed that 50 people were killed in the slaying, while at least 53 others were injured.

This makes the attack the deadliest mass shooting in American history, eclipsing the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech university, which left 32 dead.

Medics described some of those injured at Pulse this morning as being in a critical condition, sparking fears the death toll could increase even further.

The killer was seen carrying a suspicious device during the shooting at the club, which has operated in downtown Orlando since 2004.

Three hours after the attack started, a squad of officers stormed the venue and shot dead Mateen, police said. It was unclear when he shot his victims.

""Do we consider this an act of terrorism? Absolutely, we are investigating this from all parties' perspective as an act of terrorism,"" said Danny Banks, special agent in charge of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

""Whether that is domestic terrorist activity or an international one, that is something we will certainly get to the bottom of.""

This afternoon, the mayor of Orlando said 'we are dealing with something we never imagined' and confirmed a state of emergency has been issued across the city.

Mayor Buddy Dyer added that the identification of the victims may take some time.

""I continue to be proud of how our community has responded. 7/7 #PrayforOrlando,"" he tweeted.

Maten took dozens hostage between 2am and 5am before the order was given for a heavily armed SWAT to carry out the rescue mission, police said.

Nine officers used an explosive device to distract the hostage as they brought the killing to an end.

About 30 people were 'saved during the rescue', Orlando Police Chief John Mina said.

More than 320 party-goers and staff were in the club when the hostage situation unfolded.

Earlier today, a witness described how there was blood everywhere following the mass shooting.

He told the Orlando Sentinel: “I just heard the continuous bang of the gun. It was just ‘bang,bang, bang’ and constant screaming.

""I know that the guy next to me was shot and I thought I could feel liquid but it was blood.

“I then looked around and everybody was falling and dropping and screaming.

“I crawled out and I know that when you hear the banging you are not shot.

“I just know that it was very scary and very emotional. It was not an experience I want to go through again.”

The FBI is leading the shooting investigation.

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, whose officers attended the scene, said the incident 'could definitely be classified as domestic terrorism'.

However, Florida Department of Law Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Danny Banks said authorities were also investigating whether international terror was involved.

The FBI said the suspect, who is believed to be in his 20s was not a local man, may have leanings toward extreme Islamic ideologies and acted as lone wolf.

At the time of the attack in the early hours of the morning, Pulse posted a message on its Facebook page, warning revellers to 'get out of pulse and keep running'.

Ricardo Negron Almodovar was in the club.

He wrote on Facebook: ""I was there.

""People on the dance floor and bar got down on the floor and some of us who were near the bar and back exit managed to go out through the outdoor area and just ran.

Eyewitness Rosie Feba was in the club with her girlfriend.

She described the moment the shooting happened and said as she ran out of the club she saw a man who had been shot.

Speaking to the Orlando Sentinal, she said: ""Everyone was getting on the floor.

I told her [girlfriend] I didn't think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.""

Erickson Robledo said on Facebook: ""My friend is there. He almost got shot.

It was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history and, in addition to the deaths, left more than 50 hospitalized.

The shooter has been identified as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old from Port St. Lucie, Florida. Officials have said they're investigating whether the massacre was an act of terrorism.

Ronald Hopper of the FBI said Mateen was an American citizen. He was not under surveillance at the time of the shooting.

Hooper said Mateen purchased at least two firearms legally within about the past week. State records show Mateen held a firearms license since at least 2011. It was set to expire in September 2017.

Some 911 calls involving the shooter and the massacre have become federal evidence, Matten said, adding that the conversations involved the Islamic State.



Hooper said Mateen in 2013 made inflammatory comments to co-workers and Mateen was interviewed twice. Hooper calls those interviews inconclusive.



In 2014, Hooper said, officials found Mateen had ties to an American suicide bomber. Hooper described the contact as minimal and not constituting a threat at that time.



Mateen's ex-wife on Sunday said he beat her repeatedly while they were married. The woman, who wasn't named in the report, told The Washington Post that she met Mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida and marry him. She said at first the marriage was normal, but then he became abusive.



They were together for a few months then her parents intervened when learning Mateen had assaulted her. She said he wasn't very religious and gave no signs of radical Islam. She said he owned a small-caliber handgun and worked as a guard at a nearby facility for juvenile delinquents.



She said his family was from Afghanistan, but her ex-husband was born in New York. His family later moved to Florida.



Officials confirmed that Mateen was a security guard with G4S. In a 2012 newsletter, the firm identified him as working in West Palm Beach.



In a statement sent to the Palm Beach Post, the security company confirmed his employment.



""We are shocked and saddened by the tragic event that occurred at the Orlando nightclub. We can confirm that Omar Mateen had been employed with G4S since September 10, 2007. We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends, families and people affected by this unspeakable tragedy.""



Multiple news outlets are reporting that the man who killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando called 911 shortly before the attack and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. The media outlets cited unnamed law enforcement officials in their reports.



Danny Banks, an agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said authorities are investigating whether the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history was an act of domestic or international terrorism, and if the shooter acted alone.





Mateen's father told NBC News that his son recently got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami and said that might be related to the assault.



Mir Seddique said he's in shock and that he wasn't aware of anything his son might have been planning.



""We are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident,"" Seddique said. ""We are in shock like the whole country.""



The father also says the incident has nothing to do with religion.

Seddique, a native of Afghanistan, appears on a television program broadcast on a California channel.

The show is known for ""its anti-US tirades"" and ""pro-Taliban"" remarks that are broadcast in the Dari language, according to a former Afghan official. The official spoke only on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be linked to coverage of the shooting.

The official said Seddique's ""Durand Jirga Show"" is anti-Pakistan. The name of the show references the Durand line, the long disputed border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Seddique campaigned in the United States for current Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who appeared on his program in 2014. The program's studio has an address in Fort Pierce, Florida.","The shooter has been identified as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old from Port St. Lucie, Florida.

He also said the FBI and local law enforcement will have the ""full resources of the federal government"" made available to them for the investigation.

The suspected shooter, Omar Saddiqui Mateen, was shot and killed by police around 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, roughly three hours after he began his attack. This is considered the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Obama said it was a sobering reminder of how easy it is to access guns in America, and asked if that's the kind of country we want to be. ""To actively do nothing is a decision as well,"" he said.

Democratic Senator Robert Casey said he would announce a bill on Monday that would ban anyone convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime from owning a firearm. Under current law, those with felony convictions are prohibited from buying or possessing a gun, but those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes are not. Casey planned to make the announcement in his home state of Pennsylvania after a meeting with members of Pittsburgh's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Lawmakers, including some Republicans, have sought some gun restrictions after earlier mass shootings, but even minor changes failed to gain enough support to become law. Backed by the powerful gun lobby, many members of Congress see controls of weapons sales as a threat to Americans' constitutional rights. Other Democrats also called for Congress to act after Sunday's attack in Orlando, some in strong terms. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the killings would prompt debate but not action. ""The bottom line is that we allow dangerous people to buy guns in America and that has got to change,"" he said. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said the ""epidemic"" of gun violence would continue if Congress does not act and also said lawmakers shared responsibility. ""Congress has become complicit in these murders by its total, unconscionable deafening silence,"" he said in a statement. ""This doesn't have to happen but this epidemic will continue without end if Congress continues to sit on its hands and do nothing – again."" A gunman killed 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in Murphy's home state, Connecticut, in 2012. The suspected Orlando attacker, identified as Omar Mateen, 29, a U.S. citizen who was the son of immigrants from Afghanistan, was carrying an AR-15 style assault rifle and a handgun, authorities said. The shooter in Newtown also had an AR-15. Many Republicans, including the presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, focused on the threat from Islamist militants after the shooting, citing reports that Mateen was inspired by Islamic State. The FBI said Mateen had twice been interviewed after making comments to co-workers indicating he supported militant groups, but neither led to evidence of criminal activity.

Early Sunday, a heavily-armed gunman stormed a gay nightclub in Orlando and opened indiscriminate firing which left at least 53 people dead and another 53 injured. Later the gunman was killed by specially trained SWAT units.

“As head of government and representative of the people of Pakistan, I am deeply saddened by the gruesome act of terrorism in Orlando, Florida. No innocent man, woman or child should ever feel afraid of being shot or killed for being who they are in a progressive and democratic society,” the prime minister said in a statement issued on Sunday.

The prime minister said that this was against every principle of pluralism, tolerance and humanity that we have been striving for. He said that this does not represent the will of a vast majority of Muslims.

“It is just another representation of a cancer of radicalization – one that we promise to fight every day of our lives,” the prime minister remarked.

Sharif prayed for peace of the departed souls, and may the families receive justice for an inexcusable act of inhumanity.

The US media identified the gunman as Omar Mateen and an alleged Daesh sympathizer. Omar Mateen, according to media reports, was a US citizen of Afghan descent and lived in Port St Lucie, Florida.","ISLAMABAD, Pakistan: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has expressed his sadness over the gruesome act of terrorism in Orlando City of Florida, United States."

Many details are still unknown about the incident, but as the full story unfolds, PolitiFact wanted to note several recurring points made in the gun debate in recent years.

Here are seven facts and figures you need to know.

1. More than 32,000 people from gun violence each year.

 According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 33,636 gun deaths in 2013, the latest year for which data is available, or about 90 people per day. From 2009 to 2013, an average of 32,100 people died from gun-related causes each year. But not all of these deaths are the result of homicides. In fact, more than 60 percent of the deaths in 2013 were suicides.

2. That’s more than the number of casualties in all wars in American history and far more than killed by terrorist attacks.

 New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof offered this data point after the August 2015 on-air slaying of two journalists in Virginia: ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history.""

That’s True. About 1.4 million were killed in major conflicts starting from the Revolutionary War to the Iraq war, while there have been 1.5 million gun-related deaths since 1968.

A few months later, after the Oregon community college shooting in October 2015, President Barack Obama challenged the media to tally up the number of gun-related deaths and the number of terrorist-related deaths in the last decade.

That’s about 302,000 gun-related deaths versus 71 terrorism casualties, using numbers from 2005 to 2013 and preliminary counts from 2014 and 2015 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

3. The number of mass shooting is hard to pin down.

 After the Oregon shooting, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz tweeted, ""380 Americans have been killed in in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone.""

But definitions for mass shooting vary. The federal government, for example, only counts incidents with deaths. The Mass Shooting Tracker, a popular crowd-sourced site used by the Washington Post, considers any incident in which four or more people are killed or injured a mass shooting.

There were 296 mass shootings by the time of Wasserman Schultz’s tweet according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, but 122 of those incidents resulted in no casualties. We rated Wasserman Schultz’ claim Half True.

4. The gun death rate in the United States is higher than that of other developed countries, but gun violence isn’t unique to the United States.

 Addressing the nation after the Charleston shooting in June 2015, President Obama said, ""This type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.""

We rated his claim Mostly False. There have been at least 23 incidents of mass shootings in 10 other countries. In the same time period, however, there were 133 incidents in United States alone.

Obama was more on target when he tweeted, ""Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel.""

Obama’s figures are accurate, but the data is a bit old and not standardized, and at least one other data set shows lower numbers. We rated his claim Mostly True.

5. The overwhelming majority of Americans support background checks for gun purchases.

 Polls consistently show 80 to 90 percent of Americans are in favor of criminal background checks for gun sales. A 2013 poll found that 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks.

National law requires background checks in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but many states (including Florida) do not require checks for private sales.

6. The terrorist watch list isn’t an obstacle to buying guns, and violent felons determined to buy guns can circumvent the background check requirement by purchasing guns online.

 More than 2,000 people on the FBI’s list have legally purchased weapons since 2004, according to a 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. That’s about 91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns. (It’s worth noting that a 2009 Justice Department audit found that 35 percent of people on the list shouldn’t be on it.)

Unlike suspected terrorists, felons are prohibited from purchasing guns but it is possible online. Because private sellers are not required to run background checks, felons are able to purchase guns over the Internet if he orshe is in the same state as the seller.

7. The connection between gun laws and crime is still debated.

 Gun rights advocates argue that more guns in the hand of law-abiding citizens means less crime. That idea can be traced to an influential and controversial study that showed a 25 percent decrease in violent crime and a 178 percent rise in the number of concealed-carry permits from 2007 to 2014. Correlation, however, doesn’t mean causation and many have refuted the study’s findings.

Similarly, there is research showing that the more gun laws a state has, the fewer gun deaths there are. But this doesn’t prove a universal cause-and-effect relationship and could just be a correlation. It could be that low numbers of gun owners in a state mean less opposition to gun laws, and the low rate of gun ownership mean less gun violence. Experts say that there needs to be more research on gun violence and its causes.","Fifty people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday morning, the largest mass shooting in U.S. history.

The White House hopeful told supporters in New Hampshire that imposing strict border will ""protect the American people"". He also called for tighter surveillance on mosques following the horrific attack that left 49 dead in Orlando.

Discussing his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, he said: ""We must find out what is going on. We have to do it. ""It will be lifted, this ban, when, as a nation, we are in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people. ""They are pouring in and we don't know what we are doing.""

Mr Trump then went a step further by vowing to suspend all immigration from countries with links to terror against the US or its allies. He said: ""The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons."" The Republican hopeful emphasised the ban would be in place ""until we fully understand how to end these threats"".

In a TV interview this morning he said Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old who carried out the attack in Orlando, was ""sick with hate"". He added: ""You have many, many people, thousands of people already in our country that are sick with hate. ""And people that are around, Muslims, know who they are largely. They know who they are. They have to turn them in.""

He also attacked Barack Obama for not mentioning the words ""radical Islam"" during his address from the White House. The outspoken billionaire urged the ""disgraceful"" President to resign immediately and urged rival Hillary Clinton to mention the phrase. He said: ""Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen – and it is only going to get worse.""

In a lengthy statement, the Republican nominee went on to say ""radical Islamic terrorism"" has ""no place in an open and tolerant society"". He said: ""Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans. ""I am going to protect and defend all Americans. We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.""","DONALD Trump has vowed to suspend immigration from any country with a ""history of terrorism"" if elected US President."

Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.”

His second tweet, an hour and a half later, was a return to campaign trail politics – an attempt to falsely recast a verbal attack he made against a disabled journalist.

Then came another, more sympathetic tweet about the Orlando tragedy, followed by one in which he took credit for “being right on radical Islamic terrorism.” And then Trump went fully on the attack, saying, “Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn’t he should immediately resign in disgrace!”

Trump’s approach to the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history posed a sharp contrast to the conventional one of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. She first tweeted a note of concern for the victims; hours later, she issued a statement that sought to address the main issues that the tragedy touched on – terrorism, gay rights and gun control.

The disparity between the two encapsulates the choice facing voters this fall: Do they see Trump’s bombast as the solution to a dangerous world, or do they find comfort in Clinton’s more familiar manner?

Trump’s way served him well in the Republican primaries. His standing improved after the shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., and his call for “a total and complete ban” on all Muslims entering the United States. But it is unclear whether the much larger general-election audience will react as favorably to a candidate who has called for “a hell of a lot worse” than waterboarding, has said of terrorists that “you have to take out their families” and who is willing to circulate unconfirmed reports on social media amid a federal investigation.

While Trump issued a formal statement Sunday afternoon, he made most of his points about the attack via Twitter. At one point on Sunday, Trump, who has nearly 9 million followers, tweeted, “Reporting that Orlando killer shouted “Allah hu Akbar!” as he slaughtered clubgoers.” This appeared to be a slightly altered version of a tweet sent by a Fox News contributor, which did not cite a source for the information.

Stuart Stevens, who served as Mitt Romney’s chief strategist during the 2012 campaign, called Trump’s statements and actions on Sunday “childish.”

“Every day he finds a different way to show he’s unqualified to be president,” Stevens said. “Today he’s accepting congratulations at a time when 50 people are slaughtered.”

Jennifer Palmieri, communications director for the Clinton campaign, said in a statement: “This act of terror is the largest mass shooting in American history and a tragedy that requires a serious response. . . . Donald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes and self-congratulations. Trump has offered no real plans to keep our nation safe and no outreach to the Americans targeted, just insults and attacks.”

Trump’s handling of the unfolding events on Sunday – private consultation with aides while issuing a flurry of proclamations and comments on social media – is reflective of how he often handles breaking news. While he works closely with advisers to craft the theme of public remarks and statements, he believes it is also crucial for him to be part of the national conversation as soon as possible.

“He’ll monitor everything; that’s how he is. It’s not just on Twitter but on his smartphone and television and articles,” Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide, said when asked how Trump digests major news events.

Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, said in an interview that the mogul should “ignore” the rush of critics who on Sunday cast Trump’s responses as inappropriate.

“What Trump ought to do, and what he has historically done, is go to the country. And he should take the elite media head-on. There is no possibility of coexisting peacefully with these people. They are his mortal enemy, so he should relax and accept it,” Gingrich said. “He should use a campaign on social media to beat them.”

Clinton began Sunday with a personally signed tweet that drew no conclusions about the incident. “Woke up to hear the devastating news from FL. As we wait for more information, my thoughts are with those affected by this horrific act.”

Hours later, she issued a statement calling on the United States “to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad” while also imposing restrictions on firearms and ensuring that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans are not targeted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Clinton has made gun control and gay rights central issues in her campaign. Following a mass shooting last year in Roseburg, Ore., she issued a detailed plan to expand gun background checks through executive action: President Obama later adopted a similar approach. She has called for the reinstatement of an assault weapons ban, favors a California proposal regulating ammunition and has promised to seek legislation ending the immunity gun manufacturers have from some lawsuits.

And while Clinton lagged behind many Democrats in calling for the legalization of same-sex marriage, she has repeatedly called for ending discrimination against members of the LGBT community during her presidential campaign.

The mass shooting prompted both leading presidential candidates to tear up their campaign schedules. Trump had planned to give remarks Monday at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm’s College focused on scandals linked to Hillary Clinton over the years, but by late Sunday afternoon the speech had been reframed to “further address this terrorist attack, immigration, and national security.” Later, Trump’s campaign released a statement saying it was postponing a Monday evening rally that was supposed to follow the speech.

Trump, who has told aides he sees the issues as interconnected, said in his formal statement: “I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can’t afford to be politically correct anymore.”

Clinton had been scheduled to deliver a speech in Cleveland on Monday, followed by one in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, two events aimed at refocusing her campaign on Trump now that she has amassed enough delegates to secure her party’s nomination. By Sunday afternoon she had canceled a much-heralded joint rally with Obama slated for Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., citing the attack.

Speaking to reporters at the White House James S. Brady briefing room Sunday, the president framed the shooting as a moment when the nation needed to come together to support those who had been victimized and defend America’s traditions of diversity and tolerance.

He did not mention proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country or religious tests designed to prevent Muslim refugees from Iraq and Syria from coming to the United States. But they were clearly on his mind as he called on Americans not to “give into fear or turn against each other.”

Obama described the attack as “a sobering reminder that attacks on any American – regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation – is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.”

And he made a point of saying the Orlando nightclub where the killing occurred “was a place of solidarity and empowerment,” where members of the city’s gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community “came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing and to live.”

It is unclear whether the more nuanced approach Clinton and Obama are advocating – one that calls on Americans to refrain from targeting people from the Mideast or of Middle Eastern descent while pursuing incremental gains against Islamist extremists overseas – will resonate with the majority of voters.

For Trump, according to Ronald Reagan’s former education secretary William J. Bennett, Monday’s speech represents “a test” of whether he can rise above the infighting that dominated the GOP’s nomination contest.

“If he looks and sounds big, he can put his detractors to rest – the Mitt Romney people and the others who have been going after him,” said Bennett, who has grown friendly with Trump. “It’s a time for him to say we’re at war and get the whole country and party behind him. This is the kind of event that can cut through the rhetoric and the name-calling about him pretty quick and make it all fade into the background.”

constructed to support America's national defense plowed a dazzling path to orbit Saturday riding atop the immense firepower of the mightiest rocket in the world - the triple barreled Delta IV Heavy powerhouse.

for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) soared to space under mostly sunny sunshine state skies from Space Launch Complex-37 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., on June 11 at 1:51 p.m. EDT.

Although the actual launch time was classified, liftoff of the 24 story tall monster rocket came right at the opening of the publicly announced launch window - on its ninth mission overall.

The clandestine surveillance satellite with the nondescript name NROL-37 blazed to space on over two million pounds of liftoff thrust - putting on a stunning display of one of the biggest and baddest launches in many years from the Florida Space Coast.

""We are so honored to deliver the NROL-37 payload to orbit for the National Reconnaissance Office during today's incredible launch,"" said Laura Maginnis, ULA vice president of Custom Services, in a statement.

""This was the ninth time ULA launched the Delta IV Heavy, the most powerful launch vehicle in existence today.""

To the eyes and ears of myself and many space journalist friends it was among the very the best and loudest blastoffs since the retirement of NASA's space shuttle orbiter fleet back it 2011.

Spectators ringing the beaches and packing the hotels along the Atlantic Ocean shore and beyond could hear the engines roar reverberating for more than 5 minutes, even after it disappeared far far way in the distant clouds.

Spectators east of the Cape and watching from more than 20 miles away told me they hear the rockets roar and feel the rumbling in their houses and apartments even after it disappeared from sight.

The 235-foot-tall rocket arced over eastwards towards the African continent on its path skywards, providing clues to its intended orbit.

Although a preplanned communications blackout was instituted by ULA and the US military some five minutes after liftoff, it is believed that the Delta IV Heavy successfully delivered NROL-37 to a geostationary orbit and an altitude of approximately 22,300 miles.

Saturdays successful liftoff came 48 hours after gloomy weather related to Tropical Storm Colin in the so called 'sunshine state' forced a postponement for the mammoth satellite valued at over $1.5 Billion.

""The team worked together through many challenges this flow including, overcoming the aftereffects of Tropical Storm Colin,"" said Maginnis.

""We are proud of the outstanding teamwork between the ULA, NRO and Air Force partners to ensure mission success for this critical national security asset.""

The most powerful rocket in existence today was required for this launch since the immense payload reportedly weighs in excess of 17,000 pounds.

NROL-37 is being launched for the NRO on an intelligence gathering mission in support of US national defense.

The possible roles for the reconnaissance payload include signals intelligence, eavesdropping, imaging and spectroscopic observations, early missile warnings and much more.

Reports indicate it may be one of the largest satellites ever launched, weigh some 17,000 pounds and may deploy an antenna over 300 feet wide for eavesdropping purposes.

The NRO was formed in response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik and secretly created on September 6, 1961.

""The purpose is overseeing all satellite and overflight reconnaissance projects whether overt or covert. The existence of the organization is no longer classified today, but we're still pressing to perform the functions necessary to keep American citizens safe,"" according to the official NRO website.

Witnessing a Delta IV Heavy rumble to orbit is a rather rare treat since they launch infrequently.

The last of these to launch from the Cape was for NASA's inaugural test flight of the Orion crew capsule on the EFT-1 launch in Dec. 5, 2014. No other rocket was powerful enough.

Watch these spectacular launch videos from remote video cameras set at the pad:

The Delta IV Heavy employs three Common Core Boosters (CBCs). Two serve as strap-on liquid rocket boosters (LRBs) to augment the first-stage CBC and 5-m-diameter payload fairing housing the payload.

Each first stage CBC is powered by an upgraded RS-68A engine generating 702,000 pounds of thrust.

The three CBCs generate a combined 2.1 million pounds of thrust fueled by cryogenic liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.

The secret satellite was enclosed in a 5 meter diameter payload fairing.

Mr. Mateen, 29, was a security guard with G4S, one of the largest private security contractors in the world, a job that required him to obtain two Florida licences: one to work as a security officer and one to carry a firearm. Public records do not show when he first obtained those licences, but G4S said in a statement that he had been an employee since 2007.

During his nine years with the company, he was twice on the radar of the FBI: In 2013, investigators began scrutinizing him after he ""made inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible terrorist ties,"" Ronald Hopper, an assistant agent in charge of the FBI's Tampa office, said on Sunday; in 2014, the FBI became aware of contact between Mr. Mateen and a Florida man who later was a suicide bomber in Syria. The FBI concluded that the relationship between the men was insignificant and that Mr. Mateen ""did not constitute a substantive threat at that time,"" Mr. Hopper said.

Applicants for such licences are screened not only for criminal records, but for arrest records – and must not ""have demonstrated a lack of respect for the laws of [Florida] and the nation."" Officials with the Florida regulator that performs these checks could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

But based on what little evidence has emerged about Mr. Mateen's life, it is not surprising investigators were uncertain exactly where his loyalties lie.

Although Mr. Mateen reportedly pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State in a 911 call the night of the shooting, one neighbour told a Florida news reporter his car had bumper stickers promoting the U.S. military, including one with the motto of the Marine Corps, Semper Fi, which means ""Always Faithful."" In photographs that Mr. Mateen posted on the Internet of himself, he wears shirts emblazoned with the logo of the New York Police Department – the law enforcement agency that was celebrated for its response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. In a news conference on Sunday night, Mr. Mateen's former spouse said that he aspired to be a police officer, but was emotionally and mentally disturbed, with a tendency to turn violent.

Sitora Yusufiy told reporters she was ""rescued"" by family members from her ex-husband after four months of a stormy marriage that ended in divorce.

Mr. Mateen's family appears to have little to do with the brand of radical Islam that has motivated terrorist attacks in Paris, Belgium and California – a point on which Mr. Mateen's father was adamant during a brief interview with NBC News on Sunday.

""This has nothing to do with religion,"" Seddique Mir Mateen told the network. One of the few clues that Seddique Mateen was able to offer the network about what might have motivated his son came in the form of an anecdote from a recent trip they took to Miami. He said his son became ""angry"" when he noticed two men being affectionate. ""They were kissing each other and touching each other, and he said, 'Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that.' And then we were in the men's bathroom and men were kissing each other,"" Seddique Mateen said.

The elder Mr. Mateen, who was born in Afghanistan, was host of a self-produced television show called Durand Jirga, which was dedicated to discussing the Durand Line, a disputed boundary between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Omar Khatab, owner of the California-based satellite channel Payam-E-Afghan, which broadcast the show, met with Mr. Mateen's father on multiple occasions. ""[Seddique Mateen] was a secular kind of person. He was not a fanatic or religious,"" Mr. Khatab told The Globe and Mail. ""He was not politically radicalized or a hard-core Muslim.""

He said Mr. Mateen's father had not shown up for any recordings in almost a year, and that he had no contact with any other members of the family.

It is not clear when the Mateens settled in Florida. Public records show Omar Mateen was born in New York, but he and his father own homes near each other on Florida's east coast.

Media reports said Omar Mateen had worked at both a juvenile detention facility that was run by private contractors and a gated community.

One former peer told the Orlando Sentinel Mr. Mateen was an outsider in his high school years and was the target of bullying.

""You could tell it hurt his feelings,"" Brice Miller said, ""but he would laugh it off.""

""He was just dorky,"" Mr. Miller said. ""He was disliked, but he always tried to get you to laugh.""",Police identified the 29-year-old Florida resident Sunday as the perpetrator of the largest mass shooting in U.S. history

The gunman who carried out the deadly rampage at the Pulse Orlando gay nightclub was identified as Omar Mateen and was shot dead by police, according to U.S. authorities.

for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) soared to space under mostly sunny sunshine state skies from Space Launch Complex-37 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., on June 11 at 1:51 p.m. EDT.

Although the actual launch time was classified, liftoff of the 24 story tall monster rocket came right at the opening of the publicly announced launch window - on its ninth mission overall.

The clandestine surveillance satellite with the nondescript name NROL-37 blazed to space on over two million pounds of liftoff thrust - putting on a stunning display of one of the biggest and baddest launches in many years from the Florida Space Coast.

""We are so honored to deliver the NROL-37 payload to orbit for the National Reconnaissance Office during today's incredible launch,"" said Laura Maginnis, ULA vice president of Custom Services, in a statement.

""This was the ninth time ULA launched the Delta IV Heavy, the most powerful launch vehicle in existence today.""

To the eyes and ears of myself and many space journalist friends it was among the very the best and loudest blastoffs since the retirement of NASA's space shuttle orbiter fleet back it 2011.

Spectators ringing the beaches and packing the hotels along the Atlantic Ocean shore and beyond could hear the engines roar reverberating for more than 5 minutes, even after it disappeared far far way in the distant clouds.

Spectators east of the Cape and watching from more than 20 miles away told me they hear the rockets roar and feel the rumbling in their houses and apartments even after it disappeared from sight.

The 235-foot-tall rocket arced over eastwards towards the African continent on its path skywards, providing clues to its intended orbit.

Although a preplanned communications blackout was instituted by ULA and the US military some five minutes after liftoff, it is believed that the Delta IV Heavy successfully delivered NROL-37 to a geostationary orbit and an altitude of approximately 22,300 miles.

Saturdays successful liftoff came 48 hours after gloomy weather related to Tropical Storm Colin in the so called 'sunshine state' forced a postponement for the mammoth satellite valued at over $1.5 Billion.

""The team worked together through many challenges this flow including, overcoming the aftereffects of Tropical Storm Colin,"" said Maginnis.

""We are proud of the outstanding teamwork between the ULA, NRO and Air Force partners to ensure mission success for this critical national security asset.""

The most powerful rocket in existence today was required for this launch since the immense payload reportedly weighs in excess of 17,000 pounds.

NROL-37 is being launched for the NRO on an intelligence gathering mission in support of US national defense.

The possible roles for the reconnaissance payload include signals intelligence, eavesdropping, imaging and spectroscopic observations, early missile warnings and much more.

Reports indicate it may be one of the largest satellites ever launched, weigh some 17,000 pounds and may deploy an antenna over 300 feet wide for eavesdropping purposes.

The NRO was formed in response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik and secretly created on September 6, 1961.

""The purpose is overseeing all satellite and overflight reconnaissance projects whether overt or covert. The existence of the organization is no longer classified today, but we're still pressing to perform the functions necessary to keep American citizens safe,"" according to the official NRO website.

Witnessing a Delta IV Heavy rumble to orbit is a rather rare treat since they launch infrequently.

The last of these to launch from the Cape was for NASA's inaugural test flight of the Orion crew capsule on the EFT-1 launch in Dec. 5, 2014. No other rocket was powerful enough.

Watch these spectacular launch videos from remote video cameras set at the pad:

The Delta IV Heavy employs three Common Core Boosters (CBCs). Two serve as strap-on liquid rocket boosters (LRBs) to augment the first-stage CBC and 5-m-diameter payload fairing housing the payload.

Each first stage CBC is powered by an upgraded RS-68A engine generating 702,000 pounds of thrust.

The three CBCs generate a combined 2.1 million pounds of thrust fueled by cryogenic liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.

The secret satellite was enclosed in a 5 meter diameter payload fairing.

Can you tell me if this is true?

Dear D.K.: Yes, though Elvis really has left the building, and this time no vestiges of the King of Rock 'n' Roll remain. Room 1010 at the Hilton Hotel on the Southbank was known as the Elvis Suite because Elvis Presley stayed there on four occasions.

Until he died in 1977, no one else could rent the bedroom, which was appointed to his liking, according to Times-Union archives.

The hotel's chief engineer Ramsey Robertson told the Times-Union in 1995 that the room had a big brass bed, black-out curtains, hanging lamps and plush accessories in red, gold and black. He also recalled that was somewhat gaudy.

""We weren't allowed in there very much,"" Robertson said.

However, his mother-in-law got to bring Elvis a home-baked ""chocolate-chocolate"" cake after she won a contest to meet him.

His entourage occupied the top three floors of the hotel at 1201 Riverplace Blvd. Often, female fans would try to ride to the top to catch a glimpse of Elvis, snap a photo or get an autograph. Usually, his bodyguards would stop them at the ninth floor, find out what they wanted and return with an autographed photo. Sometimes, Robertson recalled, they would line them up in the hall on the 10th floor. They would walk in one door, get a peck on the cheek and come out the other, he said.

As for Elvis, he took the service elevator. His last stay at the Hilton was in May 1977, about his three months before his death on Aug. 16. Prior to that May concert, the hotel was given a facelift that featured an upbeat, tropical look with tones of flamingo reds, island greens and Florida golds, the Times-Union reported.

After his death, Elvis' associates removed his belongings. In 1996, the legendary entertainer's suite was restored when new owners renovated the hotel, which had closed in 1992. The Hilton's new general manager told the Times-Union that he was working with Elvis impersonator Rick Marino on the project, which would be tastefully done with some ""interesting artifacts.""

Staff writer Judy Wells stayed in the suite on the night of Oct. 15, 1999, for what she called ""the interest of scientific inquiry and firsthand observation."" Now retired, she told Call Box that she even brought a banana and a jar of peanut butter that she opened and placed on the suite's table. But Presley did not show up, and nary a bite was gone the next day. Wells said she ate the banana for breakfast.

As for the two-room suite, its colors were a white-washed celadon, a light ecru and bits of pale coral, and its dark furniture was classic Colonial-style, she said. But in a nod to the King, there were framed gold 45s on a wall, an Elvis-topped phone with the King singing when the handset was picked up, an Elvis lamp with a swinging pelvis, an Elvis clock and a Don't Step on My Blue Suede Shoes mat in the foyer.

Concert promoter John Mullis said Elvis liked to stay at the Hilton because he could stand on the balcony and look across the St. Johns River at the prominent Florida Theatre sign on the back of its building, Wells said.

His first Jacksonville concerts were in the mid-1950s before the Hilton opened. He stayed at Baptist Hospital after one of his Wolfson Park concerts in February 1956. The pace of one-night stands on tour had taken its toll, he was last on the bill, and he collapsed after being escorted from the stage, according to internet accounts. During his appearances at the Florida Theatre in August 1956, he spent the night at the Roosevelt Hotel.

He stayed at the Hilton in April 1972, March 1975, September 1976 and May 1977.

Now the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel, it underwent a full renovation last year, said Karen Padgett, sales coordinator. There is nothing that denotes that Elvis ever slept there, she said. The suite has been enlarged and is decorated in neutral colors. Only once or twice a year will guests mention the Elvis suite, Padgett said.

And as far as we know, there have been no recent sightings of him looking out from the balcony.

Rainbow flags have been lowered to half mast in Manchester’s Gay Village following a shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando.

The moving tribute appeared on Canal Street after 50 people were killed at the Pulse venue in the Florida state in the early hours of Sunday morning.

A state of emergency has been declared by the city’s mayor after the massacre, which is the worst mass shooting in US history.

A man thought to have been armed with an assault-type rifle and a handgun opened fire at the club at around 2am (7am BST) local time.

Another 53 people were injured in the shooting, which police have described it as an act of terrorism.

The killer, who also took hostages, was later killed in a gunfight with Swat officers in the Florida city.

Three rainbow flags above Bar Pop on Manchester’s Canal Street, in the heart of the Gay Village, were today lowered to half mast as a mark of respect to victim’s of the tragic shooting.

A message on the Bar Pop Facebook page posted on Sunday read: “As a mark of respect Antonio, John and Bar Pop team have lowered our flags as a mark of respect to today’s news from America. No Hate Just Love”

It is thought there were more than 300 people inside the club when the suspect, identified as Omar Mateen from Port St Lucie, Florida, opened fire. An officer was also shot, sustaining injuries to his face.

Pulse, which describes itself as the “hottest gay club in Orlando”, took to Facebook following the incident.

WASHINGTON, June 12 — In the wake of the deadliest shooting in U.S. history, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wasted little time suggesting the attack was tied to Islamist militants, while his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton initially did not make that connection.

Donald Trump, saying that he had predicted attacks on American soil by terrorists, reiterated his call for a ban on foreign-born Muslims entering the country, in a comment posted on Twitter.

“What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

As President Barack Obama on Sunday addressed the nation about the incident that killed 50 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Trump assailed him for his longstanding refusal to refer to Islamic State and other extremist groups as in part representing the religion of Islam.

“Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism?,” Trump tweeted as the president was speaking. “If he doesn’t he should immediately resign in disgrace.”

Donald Trump called on President Barack Obama to resign from office because he did not say the words “radical Islam,” in a statement in response to the Orlando massacre where 50 people were killed.

“Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen - and it is only going to get worse,” Trump said in a statement. “I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can’t afford to be politically correct anymore.”

Trump’s campaign said he will address the attacks in a speech he already had scheduled to deliver on Monday addressing national security and responding to criticism from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

Trump in a later tweet claimed the gunman shouted “Allah hu Akbar!” during the attack. U.S. officials as yet have not provided any information that such an incident occurred.

A gunman armed with an assault rifle attacked the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

In his remarks at the White House, Obama said the investigation into the shootings was ongoing and declined to speculate on the motives of the shooter.

“We’ve reached no definitive judgment on the precise motivations of the killer,” Obama said. “The FBI is appropriately investigating this as an act of terrorism.”

Similarly, Clinton, in a statement, called the attack an “act of terror” but did not speculate as to the ideology of the gunman, identified by authorities as Florida resident Omar Mateen.

“Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are hard at work, and we will learn more in the hours and days ahead,” said Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.

Trump earlier had boasted on Twitter that the shootings had proved that he was “right on radical Islamic terrorism.”

During the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States as a means to combat the threat of militant attacks.

“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,” Trump tweeted. “We must be smart.”

A U.S. congressman, Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, and a top member of a congressional intelligence committee, said in a statement that according to local law enforcement, the shooter had declared his allegiance to Islamic State, Schiff said, all of which “indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism.”

In addition, officials with the sheriff’s office and courts are meeting with county commissioners Monday to talk about improving courthouse security, Scott told KBKW.

Steven Daniel Kravetz is accused of shooting Deputy Polly Davin with her own gun and stabbing Judge David Edwards on Friday during a confrontation in the courthouse.

Kravetz, 34, was arrested Saturday at his mother’s home in Olympia where the deputy’s gun was recovered.

There will be extra security at the courthouse for his initial hearing, Grays Harbor Prosecutor Stew Menefee told The Daily World (http://is.gd/YLWF7W ).

Kravetz will be held in the Mason County Jail in Shelton, he said.

“We didn’t want him down here because of the stir it causes. It creates a security situation,” Menefee said.

The case has been “filed in our county, and unless there is some conflict that develops later, our office will be prosecuting and it will be in a Grays Harbor County courtroom.”

Kravetz is accused of attacking Davin after she confronted him because witnesses reported he had been acting strangely. After asking for his name, Davin was stabbed. Edwards saw the fight and stepped in to help, also getting stabbed, according to police.

Davin drew her gun, but Kravetz knocked it out of her hands, got control and fired two shots, striking the deputy once in the shoulder before he fled, witnesses said.

Both Davin and Edwards were treated and released later Friday from Grays Harbor Community Hospital in Aberdeen.

Kravetz fled the courthouse with the officer’s .45-caliber handgun and showed up about an hour or so later at the office of his former attorney and asked to the use the phone, Scott said. The attorney had represented Kravetz a number of years ago and was unaware of the shooting.

Investigators believe Kravetz called his mother, identified as Roberta Dougherty, and she apparently gave him a ride out of the area, Scott said.

It was a tip from Kravetz’s mother that led a SWAT team to the Olympia home where Kravetz surrendered.

The prosecutor said there are still many questions to be answered about what provoked the attack, which came less than three months after Judge Edwards had joined a lawsuit saying budget cuts had left the courthouse unsafe. The courthouse is not equipped with a metal detector and there was no onsite security on Friday, Scott said.","MONTESANO — The man accused of attacking a sheriff’s deputy and judge in the Grays Harbor County Courthouse is being returned to Montesano on Monday for a preliminary court appearance in the assault case, Undersheriff Rick Scott said."

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, King County Executive Dow Constantine and Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O'Toole spoke to the victims and the families affected.

""We gather here tonight in solidarity with those who lost their lives,"" Murray said. ""We offer our support to their families and to the people of Orlando.""

Other speakers offered personal accounts of bias and sexism.

As of Sunday night, a GoFundMe page created to support the victims of the shooting had raised more than $1.1 million.

Officials and first responders from around Washington state flooded social media with support and prayers for the community of Orlando after news broke early Sunday morning.

Seattle residents started gathering en masse at Cal Anderson Park at around 8 p.m.

At least 50 people were killed and at least 50 others were wounded at the gay nightclub, making it the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, according to the Associated Press.

In Tacoma, a vigil was held at 7 p.m. on the campus of Life Center Church at 1717 South Union Avenue in memory of Orlando's victims. Another vigil was held in Burlington, Washington, at Maiben Park at 8 p.m.

""Yesterday it was such an honor to join Spokane's inspiring celebration where they, as many communities across the country this weekend, were celebrating the progress we've made for our LGBTQ friends and family. It was an event marked by pride, love and joy. This morning we wake up to see this horrific tragedy in Orlando. We are all waiting to learn more about the motivations of this man but there is no doubt that today is one of unimaginable sorrow for the LGBTQ community, the people of Florida, for our nation and for people everywhere who are sickened and shocked by such an act of hatred.""

Organizers with Seattle's gay pride parade say they are expecting a spike in the number of participants in this year's parade later this month.

Thousands of people are expected to march, officials with Seattle Pride said. The annual parade is scheduled for June 26 and will be held in downtown Seattle.

In the first hour of New Year’s Day 2014, a man who talked about his ""distaste for homosexuals"" started a fire in Neighbours, a gay nightclub in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood.

No one was injured in that incident, but it led to federal charges. The arsonist, Musab Masmari, was captured in surveillance video. He claimed not to remember the incident, blaming his behavior on cheap whiskey.

Masmari was sentenced to 10 years in prison in July 2014 – twice the term that prosecutors requested.

“The Court sent a clear message: this conduct cannot be tolerated,"" Jenny Durkan, then the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, said at the time.

Also in 2014, two local men were shot in the head after one of them met the killer on a popular gay dating app.

Ali Muhammad Brown, age 30 at the time of the homicides, was charged with aggravated first-degree murder. Police also linked him to another Seattle death, and the death of a man in New Jersey.

Ahmed Said, 27, and Dwone Anderson-Young, 23, were killed early on the morning of June 1 near 29th Avenue South and South King Street.

“It is evident that the murders were premeditated and unprovoked and part of a common scheme or plan,” Senior Deputy Prosecutor Wyman Yip wrote in charging documents. “The evidence from the crime scene, Said’s vehicle, and the autopsies suggest that the victims were essentially executed.”

Brown pleaded not guilty and allegedly told investigators he killed to extract vengeance against the U.S. government for its foreign policies.

There have been multiple mass shootings in Seattle and the Northwest.

In October 2014, 15-year-old Jaylen Fryberg shot five other students in the Marysville-Pilchuck High School cafeteria before turning the gun on himself.

June 2014: A gunman killed one student and wounded two others at Seattle Pacific University. Student Jon Meis stopped the gunman, who is currently awaiting trial, with pepper spray.

May 2012: Ian Stawicki killed five people at Café Racer in North Seattle, a restaurant and bar he frequented. He also killed a woman near Town Hall Seattle and stole her SUV. Stawicki killed himself in West Seattle when approached by police.

November 2009: Four Lakewood police officers were shot by felon Maurice Clemmons. He fled to Seattle, starting a multiple-day manhunt that ended when he was fatally shot by another officer in South Seattle. Police believe Clemmons wanted to kill that Seattle officer as well, but wasn't able to fire his gun.

Rick Scott (R) on Sunday refused to acknowledged that the LGBT community had been targeted by a shooter who killed at least 50 people at a gay-themed night club.

During an interview on CNN, host Jake Tapper pointed out that the LGBT community ""appears to have been directly targeted in this attack.""

""There are a lot of members of that community and supporting friends and family who are very worried,"" Tapper explained. ""Obviously if this was radical Islam, which the special agent in charge of the FBI suggested it may have been, that is a community that has been under siege from radical Islam.""

Scott, however, declined to acknowledge the LGBT community in his response.

""We don't want anybody in our state to ever be targeted,"" he insisted. ""We don't want anybody to be discriminated against. And so in every case, when we believe there is somebody doing the wrong thing, we work hard to make sure we take care of them.""

""And so what we'll -- you know, as we go through this process, what we'll learn through this, is we'll learn what we can do to hopefully to never, never, ever to let this happen again,"" the governor added.

""But, I guess my point is you've declared a state of emergency in Orange County,"" Tapper replied. ""But there are areas of the state of Florida -- South Beach, for example -- where there may be a large and thriving LGBT community that might be very, very afraid this morning.""

""Are you taking precautions?"" the CNN host pressed. ""Are you sending law enforcement to make sure there are no copy cats or just in case this individual wasn't a lone wolf, that that community is being protected?""

""Absolutely,"" Scott replied, refusing to refer to the gay community by name. ""We have really good law enforcement in our state. And when something like this happens, one of the first things you do on top of dealing with the issue you have at hand, is say, 'Who else could this impact and what can we do to make sure that does not happen?'""

Tapper concluded by asking the governor what Americans could do to help the victims of this attack.

Muslim leaders ask Americans to ‘stand united’,"Muslim and state leaders on Sunday strongly denounced the acts of the shooter behind the mass killings in Orlando and called on Americans to stand united.

Authorities say Omar Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida, referred to the Islamic State in a 911 call early Sunday before he opened fire with an assault-type rifle in a gay nightclub, killing at least 50 and injuring 53 others. New York-born Mateen, 29, had been investigated in 2013 and again in 2014 by the FBI after he made inflammatory comments to co-workers and for possible ties to terrorists. The gunman’s motives were unclear Sunday.

“There is no possible explanation or grievance that could ever justify wanton violence against civilians. It’s completely uncalled for and goes against the decency of any society,” said Dawud Walid, executive director of the Michigan chapter of Council on American-Islamic Relations.

Walid of the advocacy and civil liberties group for Muslims in Michigan noted just days ago that the country said goodbye to Muhammad Ali, who was Muslim. Violent extremism, he said, is an anomaly within the American-Muslim community.

“The values which we strive to live up to are values exhibited by Ali, which are courage, justice, charity and empathy,” he said. “That is what American-Muslims strive to live up to and that is what people of all goodwill in America attempt to live up to.”

Also pointing to Ali as an example of “what Islam stands for” was the American Arab Civil Rights League.

“Those who commit these heinous acts are void of any humanity,” said Nasser Beydoun, board chairman of group, in a statement. “The timing one day after the funeral of Mohamed Ali, demonstrates that this person and ISIS wish to only destroy Islam and kill innocent people in clear violation of the basic tenets of the religion and humanity. In such times, we need to stand together and not be divided by the politics of fear.”

Others also called for unity. Imad Hamad, executive director of the American Human Rights Council in Dearborn, echoed Walid’s message, urging solidarity.

“This is a tough reality, that terrorism and extremism are going to live with us for a good time to come and we have to be vigilant in America as well as the free world,” said Hamad, who has visited Orlando Islamic centers and community groups in recent years to take part in engagement forums.

“At this sensitive time, I call upon fellow Americans to stand strong and united. This is a threat against all of us and it’s not limited to any segment of our society. It’s about all of us and all of us are required to face it together.”

On Sunday, state leaders offered support for the community and families touched by the tragedy.

“My wife Cynthia and I, and indeed people across Michigan and America, extend our prayers to families who have lost loved ones in this brutal shooting in Orlando,” Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said in a released statement. “At this moment, the tragic shootings in Orlando appear to be an act of domestic terrorism. Law enforcement officials are working diligently to obtain evidence of what caused this act of violence.”

U.S. Rep. Candice Miller, R-Harrison Township, said she was “shocked and horrified” by the incident.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the victims as we try to find clarity in the wake of this senseless tragedy,” Miller, who acts as vice chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a Sunday statement.

Gov. Rick Snyder on Twitter added his voice: “Sue and I ask all Michiganders to join us in prayer for Florida today — victims, families and friends.”","State leaders on Sunday strongly denounced the acts of the shooter behind the mass killings in Orlando, Florida"

U.S. and Mexican officials struck an agreement re-implementing the Migrant Protection Protocols program, otherwise known as “Remain in Mexico,” U.S. officials announced Thursday. The Biden administration was forced to follow the Remain in Mexico plan by a Supreme Court order earlier this year.

The Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State on Thursday morning outlined the plan to restart the program, confirming that Mexico had agreed to accept back migrants returned under MPP. The two governments will work out the details before reimplementing the program on Dec. 6 at seven ports of entry along the southern border: San Diego and Calexico in California; Nogales in Arizona; and El Paso, Eagle Pass, Laredo, and Brownsville in Texas.

MULTIPLE MIGRANT CARAVANS STRUGGLE TO MOVE OUT OF SOUTHERN MEXICO

President Joe Biden had initially tried to end the program, which former President Donald Trump boasted defused the border crisis before he left office, on humanitarian grounds.

In a statement Thursday morning, the administration noted it was reimposing the policy under duress, saying that “Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas has repeatedly stated that MPP has endemic flaws, imposed unjustifiable human costs, pulled resources and personnel away from other priority efforts, and failed to address the root causes of irregular migration.”

The Biden administration revised MPP to ensure all who are sent back to Mexico have their cases resolved in six months and are not waiting indefinitely, as some of the 60,000 returned under Trump had been. It also mandates that asylum-seekers have “secure access to, and communicate with, counsel before and during non-refoulement interviews and immigration court hearings” and requires more information about the legal process be provided to asylum-seekers, so they better understand the process. Asylum-seekers will also be offered coronavirus vaccines.

Single adults and families are expected to be placed into the program if they are not able to be immediately expelled to Mexico under a separate U.S. initiative known as Title 42, the Wall Street Journal reported. Title 42, a coronavirus pandemic restriction the Trump administration enacted in March 2020, allowed border officials to turn away immediately any child or adult who came across the border. The Biden administration still operates under Title 42, but in the spring, it stopped sending back most families to their home countries because Mexican state governments refused to take back migrants who were not from Mexico or Central America.

Mexico agreed, as before, to accept Spanish speakers, which could mean Haitian migrants, many of whom are coming from South America.

The elderly, people with physical or mental disabilities, and people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender will be exempt from return under MPP because they are at greatest risk of abuse or discrimination if sent back to Mexico.

Biden suspended the Remain in Mexico policy upon taking office and originally tried to end it in June, but was successfully sued by Texas and Missouri to reinstate it and lost an appeal to the Supreme Court. The administration has been in the process of restarting the program to fulfill the court order while it works to end it in a way that can withstand another legal challenge.

The move to restart the program follows the Biden administration’s second attempt to gut it in October. The DHS issued a memo to agency heads on Oct. 29 stating plans to try again at rescinding MPP on the basis it imposed “substantial and unjustifiable human costs on the individuals who were exposed to harm while waiting in Mexico.”

Although the court ordered the government to reinstate Remain in Mexico, the United States could not do so without cooperation from Mexico. The Mexican government sought assurances the asylum cases would be processed faster than they were under the previous administration, according to the Washington Post.

One factor that influenced Mexico’s decision was the Biden administration’s willingness to launch a joint development program with Mexico aimed at addressing problems in Central America that prompt people to flee north. Sembrando Oportunidades, or Planting Opportunities, was similar to a project that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had been lobbying the U.S, to take up for several years, the Post reported.

The DHS recently disclosed in court documents related to the MPP suit that the U.S. has forked up $14 million and plans to spend an additional $24 million per month to set up tent courts where judges will hear asylum cases in select regions of the U.S.-Mexico border.

Although the Biden administration previously stated this restart is not intended to be permanent, the move may face legal action.

Mayorkas has repeatedly stated that MPP has endemic flaws, imposed unjustifiable human costs, pulled resources and personnel away from other priority efforts, and failed to address the root causes of irregular migration.”

The Biden administration revised MPP to ensure all who are sent back to Mexico have their cases resolved in six months and are not waiting indefinitely, as some of the 60,000 returned under Trump had been. It also mandates that asylum-seekers have “secure access to, and communicate with, counsel before and during non-refoulement interviews and immigration court hearings” and requires more information about the legal process be provided to asylum-seekers, so they better understand the process. Asylum-seekers will also be offered coronavirus vaccines.

Single adults and families are expected to be placed into the program if they are not able to be immediately expelled to Mexico under a separate U.S. initiative known as Title 42, the Wall Street Journal reported. Title 42, a coronavirus pandemic restriction the Trump administration enacted in March 2020, allowed border officials to turn away immediately any child or adult who came across the border. The Biden administration still operates under Title 42, but in the spring, it stopped sending back most families to their home countries because Mexican state governments refused to take back migrants who were not from Mexico or Central America.

Mexico agreed, as before, to accept Spanish speakers, which could mean Haitian migrants, many of whom are coming from South America.

The elderly, people with physical or mental disabilities, and people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender will be exempt from return under MPP because they are at greatest risk of abuse or discrimination if sent back to Mexico.

Biden suspended the Remain in Mexico policy upon taking office and originally tried to end it in June, but was successfully sued by Texas and Missouri to reinstate it and lost an appeal to the Supreme Court. The administration has been in the process of restarting the program to fulfill the court order while it works to end it in a way that can withstand another legal challenge.

The move to restart the program follows the Biden administration’s second attempt to gut it in October. The DHS issued a memo to agency heads on Oct. 29 stating plans to try again at rescinding MPP on the basis it imposed “substantial and unjustifiable human costs on the individuals who were exposed to harm while waiting in Mexico.”

Although the court ordered the government to reinstate Remain in Mexico, the United States could not do so without cooperation from Mexico. The Mexican government sought assurances the asylum cases would be processed faster than they were under the previous administration, according to the Washington Post.

One factor that influenced Mexico’s decision was the Biden administration’s willingness to launch a joint development program with Mexico aimed at addressing problems in Central America that prompt people to flee north. Sembrando Oportunidades, or Planting Opportunities, was similar to a project that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had been lobbying the U.S, to take up for several years, the Post reported.

The DHS recently disclosed in court documents related to the MPP suit that the U.S. has forked up $14 million and plans to spend an additional $24 million per month to set up tent courts where judges will hear asylum cases in select regions of the U.S.-Mexico border.

Although the Biden administration previously stated this restart is not intended to be permanent, the move may face legal action.

 The suspect, 29-year-old Omar Mateen, is a Muslim American of Afghan descent and police are investigating whether he may have had a terrorist motive.



 US law enforcement is investigating whether he had ties to or was inspired by Islamist extremism, after a source linked to the Islamic State group claimed the attack.



 And the FBI confirmed that they had received reports that he made a call just before the massacre to claim allegiance to the Islamic State group.



 But relatives interviewed by US media say Mateen, who worked as a security officer, was not especially religious.

 But he did have anti-gay views and had regularly assaulted a former wife.



 Mateen`s shocked father, Mir Seddique, said his son had recently been offended to see two gay men expressing affection on a Miami street.



 ""We were in downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music,"" the father told NBC News in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.



 ""And he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry,"" Seddique said.



 The father is a minor celebrity in Afghan political circles, hosting an occasional television show in which he expressed hardline views.

 In the ""Durand Jirga Show,"" available on YouTube, he rails against the Pakistani government and announces a quixotic bid to seek the Afghan presidency.



 Sunday`s attack, which became the worst mass shooting in modern US history, was carried out in the Pulse nightclub, a well-known gay hangout.



 ""We are in shock like the whole country,"" Seddique added. ""This had nothing to do with religion.""



 In a separate interview, a former wife of the suspect who left him in 2011 fearing for her life, said he was violently abusive.""He was not a stable person,"" the ex-wife told the Washington Post, which did not identify her because she fears for her safety.



 ""He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn`t finished or something like that,"" she told the Post.



 According to the wife`s account the pair had met in New York but in March 2009 had moved in together in Fort Pierce, Florida.



 The woman`s parents rescued her from the relationship and the pair were later divorced, according to a court document seen by AFP. 

 She described him as a ""private person"" but not especially expressive about his Muslim faith.



 In a separate interview with the Washington Post, the leader of the Fort Pierce mosque where Mateen prayed described him as a quiet man.

 ""He would come and pray and leave. There was no indication at all he would do something violent,"" Imam Shafiq Rahman told the paper.

 Rahman said Mateen would attend prayers with his father and three-year-old son.



 The imam`s son, however, described Mateen as ""an aggressive person"" who used to work out regularly. 

 Mateen owned a small caliber handgun and worked as a guard at a secure facility for juvenile delinquents. Police said he bought an assault rifle before the attack.



 According to the FBI, Mateen was investigated twice for possible extremist views and contact with a US suicide bomber in 2013 and 2014 but never prosecuted.



 According to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services website, he had a gun license set to expire in September of next year.",Reports on the gunman who attacked a Florida gay nightclub and triggered a shooting that left 50 dead paint a picture of a violent and prejudiced young man.

Pride parade in West Hollywood.

James Wesley Howell, 20, of Indiana was arrested in Santa Monica, where police found three rifles, several high-capacity magazines loaded with ammunition, and chemicals that could be used for improvised explosives, Santa Monica police Lt. Saul Rodriguez said during a news conference.

Howell was arrested after police received a call at 4:59 a.m. of a suspicious man who was knocking on doors and windows. Rodriquez said Howell had no connection to the area, but when they found Howell, they also found his car, loaded with weapons.

“Our officer immediately noticed that there was a rifle in the seat of the car, which led to a further investigation, at which point, we recovered additional firearms and high-capacity magazines,” Rodriquez said.

Police later said they found a 5-gallon bucket with chemicals capable of forming an improvised explosive device. A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department alert listed the chemical as tannerite. Assault rifles as well as camouflage clothing were also found, according to the alert.

“The suspect did make an initial statement that he was going to go to the Pride festival,” Rodriguez said. “Beyond that he did not make additional statements saying he was going to do anything further than that. We do not have any additional information as to what his intentions were.”

A previous tweet issued by Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Saybrooks said Howell intended to harm many people at the gay pride event. Rodriquez called her tweet a “misstatement.”

According to Clark County, Indiana, court records, Howell had recently been convicted of intimidation in his home state in April and agreed to surrender his weapons.

The allegation was initially filed as a felony, along with a second count of pointing a firearm at another person, in October.

Under a plea agreement, Howell admitted the intimidation charge, and the charge of pointing a gun was dismissed, records show.

Howell was sentenced to one year in jail, but the jail term was suspended. He was placed on probation for at least one year and ordered to stay away from his victim.

“The defendant is to forfeit all weapons for all of probation period,” according to court records. It was unclear whether any weapons were ever surrendered or collected.

Howell’s white Acura sedan remained parked on the wrong side of 11th Street just south of Michigan Avenue with its doors open through Sunday afternoon. The sheriff’s bomb squad rendered the car safe later in the afternoon and the vehicle was towed from the neighborhood and the street reopened shortly after 3 p.m.

Howell was arrested for possession of weapons and explosive materials, and his bail was set at $500,000.

One witness on the scene, Heriberto Gomez, told reporters he saw Howell exit his Acura sedan, run across the street and hide in the bushes about 3 a.m.

“He stood there on the sidewalk near the bushes,” Gomez said. “He seen me and we stared at each other for a long minute, and he got a little shooken that I was watching him.”

Santa Monica Mayor Tony Vazquez praised the work of his city’s police department.

“On behalf of the city, we’re disappointed to hear what happened in Orlando but also wanted to thank the neighbors who did come out and report this incident,” Vazquez said.

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the agency is assisting the Santa Monica Police Department with the investigation.

But any relation to the deadly shooting in Orlando was unclear, law enforcement officials said throughout the day.

“Any possible nexus with this individual and the Pride event in West Hollywood is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” according to the Los Angeles County sheriff’s department, which was helping out in the investigation.

More than 2,000 miles away, the FBI was investigating the fatal shooting of 50 people inside an Orlando club called Pulse. Another 53 people were reportedly injured. The gunman was identified as Omar Saddiqui Mateen, 29.
• Photos: LA Pride parade rolls on despite mass shooting in Orlando

Mateen had reportedly called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, before he headed for the nightclub. He was killed in a gunfight with police.

Because of that shooting, security remained high around Sunday’s festival in West Hollywood, though there were no specific or credible threats received by law enforcement, according to a statement by the Sheriff’s Department.

The parade, part of a two-day annual festival in West Hollywood where 400,000 people were expected, went on as scheduled.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told the crowd before the start of the parade that while the festival was going forward, it was a difficult time. He said nothing should stop people from all races and backgrounds from celebrating together.

“We did not want to be here under these circumstances,” Garcetti said. “We’re here as Angelenos, as the LGBTQ community and allies, to say as Americans we will not shrink away, we will not be sullen in our homes, we will not go back in the closets. We are here to march, to celebrate and to mourn.”

Howell was set to be arraigned Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court’s Airport Courthouse.","Just hours after the worst mass shooting in American history took place inside a gay club in Orlando, Florida, a man whose car was filled with explosive material and weapons was arrested by police …"

Omar Mateen called the cops to pledge his fealty to ISIS as he was carrying out his mass murderer in Orlando early Sunday morning. Twelve hours later, the president of the United States declared that we have no definitive assessment on the motivation of Omar Mateen but that we know he was a person filled with hate.

So I guess the president thinks Mateen didnt mean it?

Here again, and horribly, we have an unmistakable indication that Obama finds it astonishingly easy to divorce himself from a reality he doesnt like  the reality of the Islamist terror war against the United States and how it is moving to our shores in the form of lone-wolf attacks.

He called it terror, which it is. But using the word terror without a limiting and defining adjective is like a doctor calling a disease cancer without making note of the affected area of the body  because if he doesnt know where the cancer is and what form it takes, he cannot attack it effectively and seek to extirpate it.

So determined is the president to avoid the subject of Islamist, ISIS-inspired or ISIS-directed terrorism that he concluded his remarks with an astonishing insistence that we need the strength and courage to change our attitudes toward the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.

Thats just disgusting. Theres no other word for it.

In a just-issued statement, she said:

""Finally, we need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.""

The rifle used in the shooting was an AR-15 type, a semi-automatic weapon that be equipped with magazines that hold several bullets. Since the first Clinton ban died under former President George W. Bush, it has become the most popular style of weapon made and sold and a favorite on gun ranges across America.



... and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.... King George IIII said exactly the same thing before he sent his Redcoats to seize the Colonists’ guns and ammunition at Lexington.

 Never forget that he paid the price all the way to Yorktown. 



He was able to PASS his background check for his AR-15 last week IN SPITE of being investigated by the FBI not once but TWO times..! And THERE is where it is like the actual goals of Fast & Furious: Bloody mass-murder headlines that would build public support for repealing gun ownership.

After calling 911 to declare his allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group, Mateen gunned down partygoers in the worst mass shooting in recent US history.

Massachusetts authorities have also said Mateen referenced the Boston Marathon bombers in his 911 call.

Twitter accounts which claim to be affiliated to the Islamic State have hailed the shooting, although it can’t be confirmed whether the terror group was behind the attack and the extent of Mateen’s links to the terror group have also not been verified.

The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee has told The Associated Press that investigators have not yet found evidence of direct communication between the Orlando nightclub gunman and Islamic State members overseas.

Mateen came to the attention of federal authorities twice prior to being identified as the gunman in the Orlando nightclub mass shooting, said Ronald Hopper, an assistant agent in charge of the FBI’s Tampa Division.

“The FBI first became aware of him in 2013 when he made inflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible terrorist ties,” but could not find any incriminating evidence, Hopper said.

In 2014, the bureau investigated him again, for possible ties to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American who grew up in Florida but went to Syria to fight for an extremist group and detonated a suicide bomb. Hopper said the bureau concluded that the contact between the two men was minimal, and that Mateen “did not constitute a substantive threat at that time”.

Authorities did confirm that Mateen legally purchased at least two firearms within the past week or so.

Mateen was born to Afghan parents in New York in 1986 and was living in Port St. Lucie, Florida, police said.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN that Mateen “made a pledge of allegiance to ISIS”.

Schiff said the timing and target of the attack can’t be a coincidence.

“The fact that this shooting took place during Ramadan and that ISIS leadership in Raqqa has been urging attacks during this time, that the target was an LGBT nightclub during (LGBT) Pride (month) and, if accurate, that according to local law enforcement the shooter declared his allegiance to ISIS, indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism,” Schiff said.

Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique, told NBC “This has nothing to do with religion”.

Seddique said his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a few months ago. He believes that incident may be related to Sunday’s shooting.

“We are saying, we are apologising for the whole incident. We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.”

Seddique also told NBC that Mateen had a three-year-old son and that he worked a security job at Indian River State College, which he also attended.

However the activities of Mateen’s father have also come into question. A former Afghan official says Seddique Mir Mateen appears on a television program known for “its anti-U.S. tirades” and “pro-Taliban” remarks. The official says the program is broadcast in the Dari language. The official spoke only on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be linked to coverage of the shooting.

Mateen’s ex-wife told the Washington Post that he was violent and mentally unstable and beat her repeatedly while they were married.

The ex-wife said she met him online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida and marry him.

At first, the marriage was normal, she said, but then he became abusive.

“He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that,” said his ex-wife.

She told the paper that Mateen wasn’t very religious and worked out at the gym often.

“He seemed like a normal human being,” she said.

She said in the few months they were married he gave no signs of having fallen under the sway of radical Islam.

The ex-wife said her parents intervened when they learned Mateen had assaulted her. Her father confirmed the account and said that the marriage lasted only a few months.

James Howell, 20, of Indiana was caught in Santa Monica, seven miles from the LA Pride festival site in West Hollywood, police said.

He was arrested at around 5 a.m. West Coast time after someone called police to report a man loitering and knocking on a door in their residential neighborhood, officials said.

He allegedly told cops he was hanging out in Santa Monica before heading to meet a friend at the parade, which was to start later Sunday.

A search of his white Acura sedan turned up five pounds of tannerite — an active ingredient for a pipe bomb — three rifles, a camouflage outfit and a security guard’s badge, authorities said.

Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks initially posted a tweet saying Howell told cops he wanted to “harm” the parade, but she took it down.

Another official in Santa Monica told the Los Angeles Times that the tweet was inaccurate, because Howell said he was going to the parade but did not elaborate on his intentions.

Officials said there did not appear to be a link between Howell and Omar Mateen, the ISIS-linked gunman in who went on a deadly rampage at Orlando’s Pulse club about three hours earlier.

Howell’s Facebook page says he lives in Jeffersonville and works for an air-filtration company, the LA Times reported. In online posts, he compared Hillary Clinton to Adolf Hilter.

West Hollywood officials considered canceling the parade but went ahead with extra security.

“My heart is bursting with ‪#‎pride‬ that, in the face of threats of violence, my community took to the streets & stood in solidarity with ‪#‎Orlando‬,” West Hollywood Councilwoman Lindsey Horvath tweeted.

Security was also added Sunday to Philadelphia’s pride parade, where marchers paid tribute to the Orlando victims.

“It’s scary,” Haden Reed, who works at an LGBT bookstore, told the local NBC TV affiliate.

“I had been thinking of moving to Florida, actually to the Orlando area. It’s just so senseless and violent. Terrible.”","A man armed with guns and explosives was busted on his way to a gay-pride parade in Southern California Sunday, hours after the Orlando massacre.

The shooting was the deadliest in US history. The suspected gunman, 29-year-old Omar Mateen, reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS, the terrorist group also known as the Islamic State, ISIL, or Daesh, in a 911 call. After news outlets reported this, the ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency released a statement on its online propaganda channels claiming responsibility for the attack. But the statement differed from those released after recent ISIS-claimed attacks in Paris and Brussels. In the Amaq statement released Sunday, the ISIS link to the Orlando attack was attributed to a ""source."" The brief statement also did not describe or provide any details about the attack. While the Paris and Brussels attackers had direct ties to ISIS leaders, it's unclear how closely Mateen is connected to the group. Michael Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst at the Levantine Group, a Middle East-based risk consultancy, told Business Insider that there had yet to be anything ""that even remotely proves the attacker was in contact with ISIS."" Horowitz said in an email: The Amaq statement provides very little details regarding the attack, and even uses a relatively cautious phrasing by saying 'source to al-Amaq,' suggesting the group had no prior knowledge of the attack. The statement also refrains from directly saying that ISIS is responsible for the attack but rather indicates that 'an Islamic State fighter' carried out the attack. Both these elements suggest the attack was ISIS-inspired rather than directed or financed by the group. Rita Katz, an expert on ISIS propaganda and cofounder of the SITE Intelligence Group, made a similar assessment. ""There is no doubt that this message from Amaq is different than the claim after the Brussels attack,"" she told Business Insider in an email. ""ISIS' Amaq message claim that shooter, Omar Mateen, is an ISIS fighter, seems to be based on the media reports that he pledged to ISIS."" The method in which the statement was released is also unusual. For past attacks, ISIS has released official statements that are directly from the group rather than from the ISIS-linked Amaq, which acts as a news service for ISIS but is not officially part of the terrorist group's media wing.

""A direct statement from ISIS would have had more weight,"" Horowitz said. ""It is not uncommon for ISIS to release its first — and sometimes only — claim via al-Amaq, yet major 'operations' such as the Paris attack or the downing of the Russian plane [in Egypt] have been claimed through official ISIS statements first, and later an al-Amaq communique."" The social-media response from ISIS supporters has also been muted compared with past attacks. After the Paris and Brussels attacks, ISIS' online channels encouraged supporters to blast out canned messages on their social-media accounts. Channels on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, which ISIS uses to send out information to supporters, asked followers to post canned messages celebrating the attacks and threatening more violence. With the Orlando attack, there was no similar campaign. ""ISIS supporters praised the attack on social media, however, there is no overwhelming output from pro-ISIS media groups"" as there was after the Paris and Brussels massacres, Katz said. This further indicates that the Orlando shooting is likely to be a ""lone wolf attack and was not coordinated with ISIS leadership as an ISIS operation,"" she noted. ISIS' leadership has showed it does not need to have had a direct role in planning an attack to claim the attack as its own. Such was the case in the shooting in San Bernardino, California, last year, which was carried out by ISIS supporters. ""With the ISIS accepting all who pledge to it, the Amaq report on the shooter being an IS fighter doesn't necessarily mean he coordinated with the IS prior to the attack, but acted in their name and they accept it as their own,"" Katz said. ISIS has been encouraging so-called lone-wolf attacks as it loses ground in the Middle East. Much of the group's recruitment efforts are based on the message that ISIS is ""remaining and expanding"" — thousands of foreign fighters flocked to ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, when the group looked like an unstoppable force. But that message has been damaged recently as ground forces backed by a US-led coalition have succeeded in taking back territory from the group. Thus, to maintain its powerful image, ISIS has started relying more on external attacks. The group has gone from calling all Muslims to come to its self-declared caliphate in the Middle East to encouraging its supporters to remain in their home countries and commit attacks there. Last month, ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani released an audio message calling on ISIS supporters to mount attacks in Western countries. ""The smallest action you do in their heartland is better and more enduring to us than what you would if you were with us,"" Adnani said in the statement. ""If one of you hoped to reach the Islamic State, we wish we were in your place to punish the Crusaders day and night."" Adnani also noted that some supporters were reluctant to kill civilians. He then provided justification. ""Know that inside the lands of the belligerent crusaders, there is no sanctity of blood and no existence of those called 'innocents,'"" Adnani said. ""Know that your targeting those who are called 'civilians' is more beloved to us and more effective, as it is more harmful, painful, and a greater deterrent to them."" Horowitz noted that these messages could be effective as calls to action for radicalized people. ""These messages by ISIS's leadership are meant to maximize the psychological impact of these attacks among the Western public,"" he said. ""They create the perception that ISIS does control these attacks from within the 'safety' of its Caliphate in Iraq and Syria. In general, however, ISIS has little control over these radicalized individuals, other than pushing them to act within a specific timeframe."" And ISIS might have seen this latest attack as an opportunity to claim a success story on US soil. ""For the first time, the group seems to be 'taking a risk' by claiming an attack without being fully aware of the surroundings of the alleged 'pledge of allegiance,'"" Horowitz said. ""This may stem from the group's situation, as it faces multiple offensives in Iraq and Syria, and would also explain the phrasing 'source to al-Amaq' before the statement."" Horowitz said on Twitter that ISIS haste in claiming the attack showed ""just how much the group was waiting for it to boost its morale as it faces multiple offensives"" in the Middle East. Mateen was known to US law enforcement. He was on an FBI list of suspected ISIS sympathizers, and federal authorities had looked into him in 2013 and 2014, officials said Sunday.

In a just-issued statement, she said:

""Finally, we need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.""

The rifle used in the shooting was an AR-15 type, a semi-automatic weapon that be equipped with magazines that hold several bullets. Since the first Clinton ban died under former President George W. Bush, it has become the most popular style of weapon made and sold and a favorite on gun ranges across America.



... and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets.... King George IIII said exactly the same thing before he sent his Redcoats to seize the Colonists’ guns and ammunition at Lexington.

 Never forget that he paid the price all the way to Yorktown. 



He was able to PASS his background check for his AR-15 last week IN SPITE of being investigated by the FBI not once but TWO times..! And THERE is where it is like the actual goals of Fast & Furious: Bloody mass-murder headlines that would build public support for repealing gun ownership. It is scary but POSSIBLE that our betters WELCOME the Florida Fifty. 



What good are insta-check if they do not stop someone who traveled to Afghanistan for weapons training WITH JIHADIS...??? If they couldn’t stop HIM, so egregious a case, then WHO exactly would the checks stop..? THE GUMMINT SUPPORTS THE CHECKS BECAUSE THEIR ACTUAL GOAL IS A SYSTEM OF DE-FACTO **GUN REGISTRATION**. 



Hillary is an psychotic, lying, murdering traitor. Whatever she says comes from stolen oxygen she excretes. You can tell from the stench it's obviously ""Hillarrhea."" 



No, Hillary, the Constitution affords us the right to protect ourselves from the murdering muslim bastards that you and your damned party are importing. We will keep our guns, and we will band muslims, and send you with them. To Hell with you, Hillary.",

“Praying for all those affected by this tragedy,” Ashraf Ghani wrote on social media.

The former president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, told CNN that Afghans stand with Americans in solidarity.

“We suffer from this, too, daily,” said Hamid Karzai, referring to the Islamic State which has carried out killings and bombings in Afghanistan.

The president’s and former president’s comments come less than 12 hours after Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old from New York, gunned down at least 50 people and injured 53 people.

“He had no right to kill innocent people, with which he had nothing to do,” he said, adding that Islam does not condone violence and that “no sane person” in Afghanistan or anywhere else would support this act of violence.

“Whatever cause he had in his mind, whatever his motivation, it was wrong for him to do it.

“Just like we condemn it in Afghanistan, we condemn it in America,” he said. “Isis does not reflect Islam.”

Mr Karzai, who lives in Kabul, said his children also live there and refuted claims that the country is “falling apart”.

He acknowledged there is conflict in Afghanistan between the government, Isis and the Taliban, but said he did not want to elaborate on that during the interview and wanted to focus on the ""tragedy"" in Florida.

Omar Mateen's father, Siddique Mateen, hosted a number of videos on a Californian television show called ""Durand Jirga"", in which he praised the Taliban and even announced his ""candidacy"" for Afghani president in May 2015.

Omar Mateen, who was shot dead after the attack, phoned 911 and claimed allegiance to Isis.",The Islamic State is terrorizing people in Afghanistan as well as in the US

A man with local ties is behind bars in California after being arrested while heavily armed on his way to a gay pride parade in West Hollywood.Police said it was several neighbors in Santa Monica, reporting a suspicious man late Saturday night and early Sunday morning, that led them to James Howell, 20, from Jeffersonville, Indiana.They said that when they arrested him, they found three assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and ammunition and a 5-gallon bucket with chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device.“There were several firearms, some rifles, some high powered magazines, then the chemicals again that could be used for an improvised explosive device,” Santa Monica police Lt. Saul Rodriguez said.Howell admitted, according to police, he was heading to a gay pride event, but did not reveal what he planned to do there.Those living in his Jeffersonville, Indiana, neighborhood were not initially caught off guard to hear of Howell’s arrest.“It doesn't surprise me too much.

Haire told WLKY he tried to befriend his neighbors' son, even offering him a job at the southern Indiana car dealership he manages. But almost immediately, according to his wife Lauren Haire, the relationship soured.“My convertible top got slashed, so did our grill cover,” Lauren Haire said, adding Howell also began verbally threatening the couple.

Barbara Poma, whose brother died in 1991, opened Pulse in 2004 with business partner Ron Legler.

The venue promoted gay rights and supported events in the gay community, ranging from Come Out with Pride to Gay Games, according to the club's website.

Pulse's patrons and others in Orlando's gay community were reeling on Sunday after a gunman killed 50 people and wounded 53 others overnight in what police said was a targeted, well-planned attack.

The shooter, who held off police for three hours before a SWAT team killed him, was identified as Omar S. Mateen, a Florida resident who might have had leanings toward Islamic State militants, a senior FBI official said.

Pulse is one of the Florida city's five gay bars, a hub for Latin music, drag performances, diva nights, bar dancers, and drinks served by muscular bartenders.

""This is a week I'll be going to funerals all week long. I don't even know who was there, but I know I'll know them,"" said Raymond Michael Sharpe, 55, a bartender at another gay bar, who has spoken to Pulse employees and patrons who survived the shooting.

He said Ms Poma was alive, as was Pulse manager Cindy Barbalock.

Reuters was not able to reach Ms Poma by phone on Sunday and Mr Legler declined to speak when he was contacted.

Hundreds of people commented with prayers, thoughts and condolences on the club's Facebook site.

Pulse bartender Juan Orrego said on his Facebook page: ""I'm home. OK. I only got shot in the leg. Thank u everybody for your prayers.""

The shooting happened at 2:00am, toward the end of one of the club's popular Latin nights, with bachata, merengue and salsa music. Many of the family members seeking their loved ones at local hospitals after the shooting were Hispanic.

One regular said he lost friends who were frequent patrons.

""There were faces we had seen all the time,"" Luis Burbano told CNN, describing how he and his friends got out alive and tried to help the wounded. ""We heard about mutual friends who did not make it.

""One of our longtime bartender friends was in a small little fitting room with 10 other people, hiding in there, waiting for a miracle, waiting for someone to come in and rescue them.""",The venue that became the scene of the worst shooting in US history promoted gay rights and held events supporting the gay community.

Seddique Mateen, who has been referred to as Mir Seddique in early news reports, hosted the ""Durand Jirga Show"" on a channel called Payam-e-Afghan, which broadcasts from California. In it, the elder Mateen speaks in the Dari language on a variety of political subjects. Dozens of videos are posted on a channel under Seddique Mateen's name on YouTube. A phone number and post office box that are displayed on the show were traced back to the Mateen home in Florida. Mateen also owns a nonprofit organization under the name Durand Jirga, which is registered in Port St. Lucie, Fla.

In one video, Mateen expresses gratitude toward the Afghan Taliban, while denouncing the Pakistani government.

""Our brothers in Waziristan, our warrior brothers in [the] Taliban movement and national Afghan Taliban are rising up,"" he said. ""Inshallah the Durand Line issue will be solved soon.""

The ""Durand Line issue"" is a historically significant one, particularly for members of the Pashtun ethnic group, whose homeland straddles the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Durand Line is that border. It is not clear whether the Mateens are Pashtun. The Afghan Taliban is mostly made up of Pashtuns.

The line was drawn as a demarcation of British and Afghan spheres of influence in 1893. The British controlled most of subcontinental Asia at the time, though some parts, including what is now Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan, were only loosely held. The line was inherited as a border by Pakistan after its independence. Since it splits the Pashtun population politically, it is seen as a cause for their marginalization. Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group in most of eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.

Pashtuns are also sometimes referred to as Pakhtuns, or Pathans.

Just hours before the Orlando shooting, Seddique Mateen posted a video on a Facebook page called Provisional Government of Afghanistan -- Seddique Mateen. In it, he seems to be pretending to be Afghanistan's president, and orders the arrest of an array of Afghan political figures.

""I order national army, national police and intelligence department to immediately imprison Karzai, Ashraf Ghani, Zalmay Khalilzad, Atmar, and Sayyaf. They are against our countrymen, and against our homeland,"" he says, while dressed in army fatigues.

The most recent video on Mateen's YouTube channel shows him declaring his candidacy for the Afghan presidency. The timing of the video is strange, as it came a year after presidential elections were held in Afghanistan. Mateen appears incoherent at times in the video, and he jumps abruptly from topic to topic. His use of Dari, instead of Pashto, the language of Pashtuns, was another strange element of his presentation, given that he is discussing issues of Pashtun nationalism.

On Sunday morning, Mateen told NBC News that his son's rampage ""has nothing to do with religion."" Instead, he offered another possible motive. He said his son got angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a few months ago. He said his son was especially enraged because the kissing took place in front of his own young son.

""We are saying we are apologising for the whole incident. We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country,"" Mateen said.

Pride Parade,"CHICAGO (CBS/AP) -- A heavily armed Indiana man was arrested Sunday morning in Santa Monica, California, while heading to the Los Angeles gay pride parade, and he allegedly told police he wanted to do harm to the event.

James Wesley Howell, 20, of Jeffersonville, Indiana, was first reported as a prowler by concerned neighbors, police said.

Police found weapons, long rifles, magazine clips, boxes of bullets, a rifle scope and a fuel canister in Howell's car, a white Acura sedan with Indiana plates.

Powder that could be used to make explosives was also found in the vehicle, along with camouflage gear.

Santa Monica police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks tweeted that Howell told officers after he was arrested that he wanted to harm the gay pride event in West Hollywood that was taking place about seven miles away later Sunday. Hundreds of thousands attend the annual event.

His arrest came as the mass shooting that killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Florida was still unfolding, but authorities said there did not appear to be any connection between the two events.

Heriberto Gomez, a lifelong resident who said he watches over the neighborhood where Howell was arrested, said he stepped outside at 3 a.m. Sunday and saw the man's white sedan parked in the wrong direction on the street.

Gomez said the man ran across the street and hid in bushes and overhanging trees. Gomez said it appeared the man saw him. He said it was too dark outside, and the man was too far away for him to provide a description. Another neighbor called police, and the man was arrested.","A heavily armed Indiana man was arrested Sunday morning in Santa Monica, California, while heading to the Los Angeles gay pride parade, and he allegedly told police he wanted to do harm to the event."

Barbara Poma, whose brother died in 1991, opened Pulse in 2004 with business partner Ron Legler.

The venue promoted gay rights and supported events in the gay community, ranging from Come Out with Pride to Gay Games, according to the club's website.

Pulse's patrons and others in Orlando's gay community were reeling on Sunday after a gunman killed 50 people and wounded 53 others overnight in what police said was a targeted, well-planned attack.

The shooter, who held off police for three hours before a SWAT team killed him, was identified as Omar S. Mateen, a Florida resident who might have had leanings toward Islamic State militants, a senior FBI official said.

Pulse is one of the Florida city's five gay bars, a hub for Latin music, drag performances, diva nights, bar dancers, and drinks served by muscular bartenders.

""This is a week I'll be going to funerals all week long. I don't even know who was there, but I know I'll know them,"" said Raymond Michael Sharpe, 55, a bartender at another gay bar, who has spoken to Pulse employees and patrons who survived the shooting.

He said Ms Poma was alive, as was Pulse manager Cindy Barbalock.

Reuters was not able to reach Ms Poma by phone on Sunday and Mr Legler declined to speak when he was contacted.

Hundreds of people commented with prayers, thoughts and condolences on the club's Facebook site.

Pulse bartender Juan Orrego said on his Facebook page: ""I'm home. OK. I only got shot in the leg. Thank u everybody for your prayers.""

The shooting happened at 2:00am, toward the end of one of the club's popular Latin nights, with bachata, merengue and salsa music. Many of the family members seeking their loved ones at local hospitals after the shooting were Hispanic.

One regular said he lost friends who were frequent patrons.

""There were faces we had seen all the time,"" Luis Burbano told CNN, describing how he and his friends got out alive and tried to help the wounded. ""We heard about mutual friends who did not make it.

""One of our longtime bartender friends was in a small little fitting room with 10 other people, hiding in there, waiting for a miracle, waiting for someone to come in and rescue them.""",The venue that became the scene of the worst shooting in US history promoted gay rights and held events supporting the gay community.

Seddique Mateen, who has been referred to as Mir Seddique in early news reports, hosted the ""Durand Jirga Show"" on a channel called Payam-e-Afghan, which broadcasts from California. In it, the elder Mateen speaks in the Dari language on a variety of political subjects. Dozens of videos are posted on a channel under Seddique Mateen's name on YouTube. A phone number and post office box that are displayed on the show were traced back to the Mateen home in Florida. Mateen also owns a nonprofit organization under the name Durand Jirga, which is registered in Port St. Lucie, Fla.

In one video, Mateen expresses gratitude toward the Afghan Taliban, while denouncing the Pakistani government.

""Our brothers in Waziristan, our warrior brothers in [the] Taliban movement and national Afghan Taliban are rising up,"" he said. ""Inshallah the Durand Line issue will be solved soon.""

The ""Durand Line issue"" is a historically significant one, particularly for members of the Pashtun ethnic group, whose homeland straddles the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Durand Line is that border. It is not clear whether the Mateens are Pashtun. The Afghan Taliban is mostly made up of Pashtuns.

The line was drawn as a demarcation of British and Afghan spheres of influence in 1893. The British controlled most of subcontinental Asia at the time, though some parts, including what is now Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan, were only loosely held. The line was inherited as a border by Pakistan after its independence. Since it splits the Pashtun population politically, it is seen as a cause for their marginalization. Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group in most of eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.

Pashtuns are also sometimes referred to as Pakhtuns, or Pathans.

The New York Police Department is stepping up security at LGBT landmarks across the city following the mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Florida on Sunday morning.

“We are vigilant, we have deployed our critical response command and our strategic response groups, so you’ll see a lot of additional police presence on the streets of the city, in some of the heavy trafficked areas, you’ll see police presence in front of some key LGBT community institutions,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday, The New York Post reports.

“There are no credible threats directed against New York City. At the same time, we are on high alert.”

The shooting took the lives of 50 people and wounded more than 50 others. FBI is currently investigating the shooter's motives.

James Waters, the department’s head of counter-terrorism, said that officers will be visible in the days following the attack.

“We’ve selected locations in the downtown area like the Stonewall and the vicinity,” Waters told The Post. “We will be moving from place to place and moving our resources around.""

Last night, our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist. It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in six months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded and their families.

In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words ‘Radical Islam.’ For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words ‘Radical Islam’ she should get out of this race for the Presidency.

If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen — and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can’t afford to be politically correct anymore.

The terrorist, Omar Mir Saddique Mateen, is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan. According to Pew, 99 percent of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.

We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year. Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.

Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term — and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.

We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism — which has no place in an open and tolerant society.

At least 50 people were killed and 53 were wounded when a gunman opened fire inside Pulse nightclub early Sunday. Throughout the day, many have been offering words of support for the victims.

""Last night's horrifying act of terrorism in Orlando was an attack on our most fundamental values as Americans. On behalf of the City of Chicago, Amy and I send our deepest condolences to the friends and family members of those who were lost. June is a time when all Chicagoans and all Americans proudly celebrate the contributions of our LGBT community. This horrendous violence will only deepen our resolve to continue building a society that values everyone, regardless of who they love. The thoughts and prayers of Chicago will remain with the victims of this attack as they seek comfort and courage in the days ahead.""

""The worst thing that we could do right now is compound a horrible act of anti-LGBT hate by promoting anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant hate. To use this tragedy to promote Trump-like behavior would be despicable. It is a race to the bottom, branding all people in a group, regardless of character, as the enemy. ""As LGBTs we have recently won so many rights -- with the aid of many non-LGBTs of all faiths -- and so it would be unworthy of us to become haters towards any other group of people. We have in our LGBT community many Muslims and immigrants who catch it from both sides -- racist Islamophobes on one side, anti-LGBT bigots on the other. We especially need to stand with them, and stand against scapegoating, period. ""Florida Senator Bill Nelson just a few moments ago said that we need to not be ""hyphenated Americans, but stand together as Americans."" Sorry Mr. Senator, but this was an apparent anti-gay attack. Disregarding that fact is to disregard the hate that has been promoted by anti-gay political and religious leaders of both parties, especially in the American South. ""With a presidential candidate making it his calling card, Islamophobia is also a huge threat. Until we stand together not as Americans, but as human beings regardless of race, nationality or religion, and confront what our own leaders are doing to perpetuate this cycle of violence, whether scapegoating groups or serial bombings of other countries, it will not end.""

""Our prayers and hearts are with the victims of the mass shooting in Orlando, their families and our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters. ""We are grateful to the first responders and civilians who heroically put themselves in harm's way, providing an enduring reminder of what compassion and bravery look like--even in the face of such horror and danger. ""In response to hatred, we are called to sow love. In response to violence, peace. And, in response to intolerance, tolerance. ""The people of the Archdiocese of Chicago stand with the victims and their loved ones, and reaffirm our commitment, with Pope Francis, to address the causes of such tragedy, including easy access to deadly weapons. We can no longer stand by and do nothing.""

""The Sunday morning massacre in Orlando, Fl., today was a blatant act of terror. Whether it was inspired by foreign ideologies or domestic hatreds, we do not yet know. ""Whatever the twisted motivation turns out to be for the most lethal mass shooting in U.S. history, we must end, once and for all, the shamefully easy access to guns that is killing so many Americans. ""We owe it to the 20 first graders and their teachers gunned down at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. in 2012, we owe to the 14 people killed at an office holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., in 2015, we owe it to the 31 college students slaughtered in Blacksburg, Va., in 2007 and the list goes on. ""Gun violence is a national epidemic, an international disgrace. This past May in Chicago, 66 people were slain, almost all by guns. More than 300 others were shot and wounded. ""We must enact sensible gun control laws and enforce them. It is past time to reinstate the ban on assault weapons, such as the one used this morning at the Pulse nightclub to kill 50 people and send 53 others to the hospital, many in critical condition. ""We must choose futures over funerals and stop the flow of guns.""

""Today's hateful terror attack at Orlando's Pulse nightclub--a mass shooting targeting our LGBTQ community during this year's pride celebrations--is absolutely heartbreaking and profoundly cowardly. My condolences, thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, their friends and their loved ones today."" ""I also wish to thank the law enforcement officials, first responders and all those who acted with bravery, courage and heroism in the face of the most deadly shooting in our nation's history. They represent the America I fought to defend. As the President reminded the American people just moments ago, we must stand united as Americans, love one another and never turn against each other in the face of fear.""

""This morning's mass shooting was the worst in American history. 50 people were massacred and dozens more injured when a heavily armed man opened fire on innocent people. My thoughts and deepest condolences are with the victims and their loved ones, and I stand in solidarity with the LGBT community in Orlando and across America. These mass shootings follow an increasingly tragic script: the public is heartbroken and outraged, first responders and law enforcement do their grim duty, and Congress proposes a slew of policy proposals and argues over whether any of them could have prevented the last tragedy. But when the debates end and nothing has changed, Congress makes itself complicit in the next killing. We have the power to act, and we must. The bottom line is that we allow dangerous people to buy guns in America and that has got to change. In the coming days, Congress must take a stand against hate, terrorism, and this horrific gun violence.""

""The lives of at least fifty brothers, daughters, sons, parents, and children were taken senselessly and suddenly today. It is difficult to find words to describe the grief and shock that I share with Americans across the country who watch and wait for more news coming out of Orlando today. I stand in solidarity with the victims of last night's horrible attack, their loved ones, and the LGBT community. ""Although at this early stage we are still waiting for details to emerge from the scene, we do know that this attack was motivated by hatred and a lack of empathy and understanding. It is crucial that we as a society come together to eradicate the barriers of discrimination that divide us and spur tragedies like the one we have witnessed today. Our culture must be purged of the kind of discourse and behavior that feeds off of division, and instead work to become the inclusive and diverse society that is inherent in the American promise. ""This by no means is to say that a change in hearts and minds is all that we need to end the scourge of mass shootings and large-scale attacks. Pragmatic legislative solutions are required. Sensible gun safety measures are long overdue. Their presence may not eradicate violence and lawlessness in our country, but it can certainly make it more difficult for the individuals who would carry out these acts to do so. Additionally, since certain reports indicate that this attack may have been motivated by the actions of the Islamic State, we must continue our efforts to combat global terrorism abroad and at home.""

""I woke, along with the rest of the nation, to the horrific news of tragedy at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. My heart aches for those killed and wounded in this senseless and deadly attack. While many questions remain, we do know that this is the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which targeted innocent men and women just hoping to spend a night out with friends. And an attack at Pulse nightclub, a well known gathering spot for LGBT Floridians, during LGBT Pride Month is particularly painful for the LGBT community and allies around the world. At this time, we must all come together and combat this horrific act of hate with love and compassion for one another.""","Local elected officials, activists, and community groups are reacting to the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida."

Fifty people have been confirmed dead, and a further 53 are injured after 29-year-old Omar Mateen stormed the Pulse nightclub armed with an assault rifle and a pistol, and opened fire.

He reportedly pledged allegiance to Islamic State during a call to 911 before the attack at around 2am on Sunday morning (local time).

Social media has been flooded as celebrities, journalists, politicians and users express their sorrow and disdain. 'Pray for Orlando' began trending on Twitter and Facebook after the shooting, and Pulse nightclub urged people to “keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event” on its Facebook page.

Facebook enabled its Safety Check feature, allowing those in the area to confirm whether they’re safe, unsafe or outside the affected area.

It is the first time it has been employed in the United States.

“We hope people in the area find the tool a helpful way to let their friends and family know they are okay,” Facebook said in a statement.

Victims of the horrific shooting took to Facebook and Twitter as they alerted others to the events inside.

Brandon Wolf, a local resident, tweeted “Shooting at pulse. We hit in the bathroom. And we can’t find our friends.”",

So far, seven of the victims of gunman Omar Mateen’s spree have been identifed: Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34 years old; Stanley Almodovar III, 23; Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20; Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22; Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36; Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz, 22; Luis S. Vielma, 22; and Kimberly Morris, 37.

At Ember in downtown Orlando, crowd members spontaneously broke out into clapping at the close of a twilight candlelight vigil.

“Love wins, y’all!” shouted Henry Ballesteros of Orlando, triggering a wave of cheers across the crowd.

The group gathered on the bar’s outdoor patio, holding white, tapered candles above their heads in silence.

Ballesteros, 47, said by focusing on love and not hate, he hopes no attention goes to the gunman who carried out the attacks.

“I don’t know want to know his name,” he said.

Braden Cowell, 27, of Orlando, also came to Ember for the vigil, bringing rainbow banners in a gesture of defiance against terror.

“If we don’t come out today and support our community, they win,” he said.

At Jones High School, just a few miles from Pulse, a vigil organized by the Experience Christian Center brought together seven pastors, “all sharing in prayer, different denominations all coming together for a common cause,” said Experience Senior Pastor Derrick McCrae.

“What prayer does is give direction,” McCrae said. “People find inner strength through a conversation with God. We want to see no division, and only see unity. We want to be mindful of what could happen to us at any point in life, but also be confident in who is keeping us.”

Speakers talked of the other vigils happening elsewhere at hospitals, in which family members wait on news of their loved ones.

“There are those who believe they have power over life and death,” said Rabbi David Kay of Congregation Ohev Shalom. “But they do not. As long as we come together, no act of terror, no act of murder, no act of hate can extinguish the light that has kindled from what we all start here tonight.”

Stephen A. Green, national director of the Youth Department of the NAACP, said, “We come against any bigotry, any sexism, any racism, any homophobia.”

U.S. Rep. Corinne Brown told attendees, “Orlando is a big city, but we are family, and I had to be with my family.”

“We cannot continue to let this happen in our country,” Brown said.”This is the beginning, and Orlando will lead the way.”

Experience spokesman Dominic C. Clark said that the vigil was a way “to let them know the faith-based community is still here. What better place than close to downtown. We made a few calls this morning and it was like, ‘absolutely.’ … We’re simply praying for healing in Orlando.”

Some attendees said they were worried about the future – and hoped the response to the shootings can have a positive effect.

Dominique Belt of Orlando said before the vigil, “now it feels like we’re no longer safe. I’ve been in Florida all my life, and we used to leave the window open and fell safe at night. Now, I’m scared to shop.

“I think that in coming together and praying, we can demand change,” Salt said.

Mateen of Fort Pierce has been identifed as the gunman and was among those killed early Saturday.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation three times interviewed Mateen for having alleged terrorist ties. The FBI learned of Mateen in 2013 after he made inflammatory remarks to coworkers and alleged terrorist ties, said FBI Special Agent In Charge Ron Hopper.

The FBI investigated and interviewed witnesses and Mateen, but closed the investigation. He came to the FBI’s attention again in 2014 for making contact with a suicide bomber. Their connection was considered minimal by the FBI, and closed the investigation.

U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, D-Florida, said the Islamic State claimed responsibility for a massacre.

Mateen – the lone gunman – called 911 moments before the attack and pledged his allegiance to Islamic State, a federal law enforcement official said, confirming earlier reports.

Federal investigators believe the selfie photos of Mateen taken from his MySpace page are of him, but said the investigation was still in its early stages.

Mateen, 29, of Port St. Lucie, was killed after a shootout with Orlando police. He was armed with a pistol and assault rifle.

President Barack Obama, in a news conference on Sunday, said the shooting is “a sobering reminder that attacks on any American – regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation – is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.”

“We know enough to say this was an act of terror and an act of hate,” he said.

U.S. investigators are operating under a theory that the Orlando nightclub mass shooting was inspired by Islamic State, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday.

Similarities with the November attack on the Bataclan nightclub in Paris, and that the shooter appeared to target a gay dance club during the Muslim month of Ramadan, “indicates an ISIS-inspired act of terrorism,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, said in a statement.

Intelligence officers are combing through terrorism databases to see if there are any known links between the alleged shooter and a terrorist group, Schiff said. Multiple outlets, including CNN, reported Mateen made a 911 call before the attack, pledging allegiance to ISIS.

There haven’t been signs so far that Islamic State leaders helped orchestrate the plot, he said. “Whether this attack was ISIS-directed remains to be determined,” he said.

Christopher Hansen, who was inside the Pulse nightclub during the attack, said he dropped to the floor when he heard about 40 gunshots. People ran from the bar as police officers screamed for everyone to leave.

“I just fell down and crawled out,” said Hansen, 23.

“I helped someone who was on the ground. I wasn’t sure if he was dead or alive,” he said.

As people fled the club, Pulse Orlando posted a note to its own page that said, “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.”

Police Chief John Mina said Mateen fired the first shot at about 2:02 a.m. at an Orlando police officer and then ran into the club, which held more than 200 people. Details about exactly what happened inside the club were unclear, but police handled it as a hostage situation.

By 5 a.m., the police department’s SWAT team opened fire. They distracted Mateen with an explosive device and plowed into the building with a vehicle. When officers went inside, they discovered 50 dead, including Mateen, and 53 injured.

Mina said nine officers were involved in the shooting. One sustained an injury to his eye and was saved by his helmet.

Mina credited his officers with rescuing 30 hostages from Pulse Orlando at 1912 S. Orange Ave., which is just south of Downtown Orlando and near Orlando Regional Medical Center.

Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer declared the city in “a state of emergency,” and Gov. Rick Scott, who was at the scene, extended it to all of Orange County.

“Tonight our community witnessed or experienced a very horrific crime,” Dyer said.

In an attempt to shift family members away from ORMC, where many of the injured were taken, authorities set up an information center at a nearby Hampton Inn & Suites at 43 Columbia St., and urged relatives to call 407-246-4357.

U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, called the attack a “hate crime” because the shooting happened at a gay club.

“It’s no coincidence the attack took place where it did and when it did,” he said.

Authorities said there is no indication of impending attacks in Florida or across the nation. The FBI is leading the investigation.

Mina said the situation is not related to a separate shooting Friday inside The Plaza Live theater in Orlando, where a man opened fire, killing former NBC’s “The Voice” contestant Christina Grimmie and himself.

‘I saw fire coming out of his gun’

It was Latin night at the club.

Mina said some people trapped inside the club hid in the bathrooms and called 911.

Rosie Feba was there with her girlfriend for the first time.

“She told me someone was shooting. Everyone was getting on the floor,” Feba said. “I told her I didn’t think it was real, I thought it was just part of the music, until I saw fire coming out of his gun.”

Feba and her girlfriend ran out of the club. On the way out, they saw a man who had been shot.

Feba grabbed him. Others around her called 911. Some of the man’s blood stained the sleeve of her striped T-shirt.

Both Feba and her girlfriend were unharmed, but shaken. They waited in a CVS parking lot for more information.

Victims experiencing emotional trauma related to the shooting can dial 2-1-1 for support, said Ashley Blasewitz of the Heart of Florida United Way.

Many of the victims were taken to ORMC, where family members gathered, hoping to get information.

Florida Hospital wouldn’t comment on whether it was treating any of the injured, but said they can check on names for families.

Mina called the mass shooting “absolutely terrible. … one of the worst tragedies we’ve seen.”

He said the immediate priority is to identify the dead and injured and notify their next of kin, something that he said would require people to be patient.

“Unfortunately this tragedy and the amount of bodies that are in there, the amount of victims, is going to take some time,” Mina said.

Carlos Muniz went to OPD headquarters after the shooting to give an interview.

“It was massacre, basically,” said Muniz, who was in the club at the time of the shooting. “And one of our friends is missing.”

Muniz initially thought the shots were part of the music.

Meanwhile, authorities scoured the area for explosive devices, using robotic devices and K-9 dogs. In addition to carrying the weapons, Mina said Mateen was possibly wearing an explosive device.

Imam Muhammad Musri, president of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, urged people to pray on what he called “a heart-breaking morning.”

“It’s a horrible tragedy. We are mourning, we are sad. We are heartbroken,” he said.

A mass shooting, he added, “is the worst nightmare, and we are sorry to know that it happened to us.”

U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said Senate intelligence committee staff “do believe there is some connection to ISIS.”

“There appears to be some connection to Islamic radicalism,” he said at a news conference at the command center in Orlando.","Mourners across Orlando – as well as the nation and world – paused Sunday night to remember the 50 people killed and 53 injured in the Pulse nightclub shooting, the deadliest mass shoot…"

I’m angry this keeps happening. I’m frustrated people going to a movie or a concert or a club, or commuting to work, or going to school are being killed by others who have assault rifles.

In June 2013, the American Medical Association (AMA) issued a statement requesting the FDA modify their blood donation policies, stating that “The lifetime ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men is discriminatory and not based on sound science.” That policy was changed, but still gay men cannot donate blood if they’ve had sex in the last year even if they’ve passed an HIV/AIDS test.

CAIRO, June 12 (Aswat Masriya) - Egypt strongly condemned on Sunday the “terrorist attack” in the state of Florida in the US which claimed the lives of 50 people and injured dozens.

Earlier on Sunday, an armed man opened fire at a nightclub in the the city of Orlando in Florida, killing at least 50 people and injuring a dozen others in an attack that was described as the “worst” in U.S. recent history.

Police killed the shooter, who is believed to belong to Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq (ISIS), but U.S. officials cautioned they had no direct evidence of a connection, Reuters reported.

U.S. President Barack Obama said that it is “an act of terror”, adding that the U.S. has not yet reached a “definitive judgement on the precise motivations of the killer.”

Obama said the Florida shooting marks the most “deadly” in U.S. history.

""We thought we could relax for a couple of years and tell people we are normal human beings."" FBI assistant special agent in charge Ron Hopper answers questions from members of the media. Mr Rahman said he planned to add extra security to the mosque and brighter lighting to help reassure followers they were safe amid fears of a public backlash against Muslims. Still, much remains unclear about the motivations of Mateen. He was born in New York of Afghan descent. A classmate from his Florida high school described him as a typical teenager who played football for a Martin County team in Stuart, a small city about a 20-minute drive from Fort Pierce. Mir Seddique Mateen is the father of Orlando shooter Omar Mateen.

Samuel King said he often spoke to Mateen after he graduated high school. Mr King said he worked at Ruby Tuesday's restaurant in the Treasure Coast Mall, where Mateen worked at GNC, a nutrition store. Mr King, who is openly gay, said the Mateen he knew until 2009 did not appear to be anti-gay. An injured man is escorted out of the Pulse nightclub after the deadly shooting. ""What is shocking to me is that the majority of the staff at Ruby Tuesday's when I worked there were gay. He clearly was not anti-[gay], at least not back then. He did not show any hatred to any of us. He treated us all like the individuals we were. He always smiled and said hello."" Mr King described Mateen as gregarious and talkative in the immediate years after high school, but said ""something must have changed"" since he last saw him in 2009.

Huge holes were blown out of the side of the nightclub by police in the shooting. Mateen's father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News the massacre was not related to religion. ""We are apologising for the whole incident. We weren't aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country,"" he was quoted by the network as saying. Omar Mateen who opened fire inside the crowded gay nightclub early on Sunday. He said his son turned angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami a couple of months ago. Mateen's ex-wife, who spoke to The Washington Post, said her former husband was violent and mentally ill and beat her repeatedly while they were married.

The FBI twice interviewed Mateen for having suspected ties to Islamist militants, a process likely to renew questions over whether the US government has a clear strategy or adequate resources to turn Americans away from radicalism. The first investigation took place in 2013 when Mateen made inflammatory comments to co-workers that indicated sympathy for militants, FBI special agent in charge Ron Hopper told a news conference in Orlando. It was unclear where Mateen worked. He had been employed as a security guard by G4S in Florida since September 2007, according to the British-owned multinational company, among the world's largest private security firms. G4S provides security to federal buildings in Florida. It was unclear if Mateen had access to them. He was investigated and interviewed twice but the FBI was ""unable to verify the substance of his comments,"" Mr Hopper said.

In 2014, Mr Hopper said, Mateen was investigated and interviewed again, this time for suspected connections to Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, an American citizen who became a suicide bomber in Syria in 2014. Mr Hopper said Mateen's contact with Abu-Salha was minimal and it was deemed that ""he did not constitute a substantive threat at that time"". Mr Hopper said Mateen was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of Sunday's attack. Mr Hopper said Mateen called emergency services during the massacre to pledge allegiance to Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which in recent years declared a caliphate over large swaths of Iraq and Syria. But the depth of that commitment is unclear.

One US counter-terrorism official said there was ""no evidence yet that this was directed or connected to ISIS. So far as we know at this time, his first direct contact was a pledge of bayat [loyalty] he made during the massacre."" Mateen also mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers during the call, which he made 20 minutes into the shootings, authorities said. Mateen's former wife said she met Mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to Florida to marry him, The Washington Post reported. ""He was not a stable person,"" she said. ""He beat me. He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn't finished or something like that."" Mateen had a Florida firearms licence that expired in 2013 and a state permit to work as a security guard, according to public records. He was registered as a Democrat.",A picture has begun to emerge of the gunman in the latest US massacre who was quiet and had few friends and had been interviewed by US authorities in recent years for suspected sympathies with Muslim extremists.

“The Islamic State’s news agency has just issued a statement that says that they are responsible. That has not been confirmed,” Nelson said. “We’ll have to see what those connections are once we get the details.”

Early Sunday morning, 29-year-old Omar Mateen, a US citizen, opened fire on a LGBT club, killing at least 50 people and taking hostages before being killed in a gun battle with police.

According to Twitter accounts supporting Daesh, the group claimed they would attack Florida three days before the shooting. Several accounts praised Mateen’s actions.

Authorities have identified the killer as Omar Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce. Federal agents are now probing whether Mateen was inspired by the Islamic State terrorism group — a law-enforcement source said Mateen called 911 from the club to express support for ISIS.

As the country awoke Sunday to the shock of yet another mass shooting, federal agents with South Florida’s Joint Terrorism Task Force had joined in the investigation into Mateen, who is of Afghan descent. Authorities with knowledge of the investigation say agents have already begun interviewing Mateen’s relatives, and search warrants were expected to be executed Sunday afternoon.

A somber President Barack Obama — addressing the nation Sunday afternoon yet again after a mass shooting — said “this was an act of terror, an act of hate.” He noted the devastating significance of the shooting for the gay, lesbian and transgender community.

“The place where they were attacked was more than a nightclub, it was a place of solidarity,” Obama said.

Exactly what spurred Mateen to attack the popular gay nightclub on Sunday is now under investigation. The terror group ISIS has been known to target gays.

His father, Mir Seddique, told NBC News that he believed the shooting “has nothing to do with religion” but instead was outrage sparked after his son, during a family trip, saw two men kissing at Bayside Marketplace in downtown Miami a few months ago.

“We are saying we are apologized for the whole incident,” he told NBC News. “We weren’t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country.”

U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., speaking to reporters Sunday, said he believed the shooting was a “hate crime,” although the FBI stopped short of saying that. “It’s absolutely one of the worst tragedies we’ve seen,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters Sunday morning. “It’s terrible. There are more victims inside than we earlier thought.”

The exact motivation for the shooting remained unclear Sunday as investigators looked to piece together Mateen’s past.

Born in New York, Mateen was a U.S. citizen who hailed from the Fort Pierce and Port St. Lucie area, which is about 118 miles from Orlando.

State records show that he was a licensed Florida security guard, and also held a state firearms license. The media was also showing photos purportedly of Mateen — taken from a MySpace social media account — wearing a New York Police T-shirt.

The Daily Beast, citing a law enforcement source, also reported Sunday that the FBI had twice investigated Mateen and that he was “a known quantity.”

State records show he was briefly married to a woman named Sitora Yusufiy in 2009; they had since divorced. His ex-wife told The Washington Post that he became mentally unstable. “He would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn’t finished or something like that,” she told the newspaper.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, and vowed to expend all resources to help. Obama received regular briefings. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims,” the president’s press secretary said in a statement.

Before noon Sunday, politicians on all sides — including presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump — had already begun issuing statements and sending out tweets. Religious leaders were also urging calm.

“We are heartbroken. We are sad. It’s not time for sensationalized news, or a rush to judgment,” Imam Muhammad Musri, of the Islamic Society of Central Florida in Orlando, told reporters outside the crime scene. “We need to look at this issue of mass shooting because we have had one too many today.”

Meanwhile, medical personnel in Orlando were working frantically to help the critically wounded. Six trauma surgeons were rushed to local hospitals as doctors were calling for people around Florida to donate blood to their local blood banks.

“We have spent the morning operating on a number of victims,” Dr. Michael Cheatham, from the Orlando Regional Medical Center, told reporters. “We continue to operate on them.”

By 3:00 p.m., the hospital confirmed that 44 adults had been admitted to the hospital with gunshot wounds. Nine died in the hospital, one was discharged and all patients have been identified. The hospital was working to reunite patients with their families.

The scene of the violence was Orlando’s Pulse nightclub, a popular gay nightspot where over 300 people were partying early Sunday. Police said Mateen opened fire around 2 a.m., taking scores of people hostage just before closing time as people were downing their final drinks.

Just after 2 a.m., the club posted on its own Facebook page: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.”

A bouncer knocked down a partition between the club area and an area in the back where only workers are allowed. People inside were able to then escape through the back of the club.

Kenneth Melendez told the Orlando Sentinel that he and his friends were at the club when the shooting happened. Four of his friends were shot and were at a hospital, he said.

“It’s just something that you see in the movies but never think would happen to you,” he said.

“At first, when I heard the shots I thought it was part of the music, but then we realized it was really happening. I started running and saw someone bleeding from the arm and I was like wow this is really happening and I kept running.”

He said he went to Pulse often because it was a “safe environment where you could express yourself … Not anymore.”

Heavily armed Orlando police officers later stormed the nightclub, killing Mateen just before 6 a.m. He was carrying an AR-15 type assault rifle, a handgun and possibly wearing an explosive “device,” police said. Nine Orlando police officers were involved in the shootout, and one was shot in the helmet, but survived.

“Tonight we had a crime that will have a lasting effect on our community,” said Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer at a news conference. “We need to stand strong, we need to be supportive of the victims and their families.”

Orlando homicide detectives were undergoing the grim task of identifying the dead and notifying their relatives.

Some wounded victims were taken to Orlando Health, which on social media announced a family information center early Sunday morning, directing family members to 52 West Underwood St.

One Blood, a southeastern United States blood blank, issued an urgent call for donors after the massing shooting.

Thousands were already in line to either donate blood or pass out water and supplies to those in line.

Chris Brooks, 31, who grew up in Orlando, drove more than an hour from Merritt Island. He uses blood thinners, so he wasn’t sure if he could donate blood, so he was helping to pass out water and supplies.

“I feel that it’s my time to give something back to the world,” he said.

Ruth Schultz, a local business owner, didn’t even bother to put a closed sign on her boutique, Got Karma. Instead, she went straight to a local blood bank to donate blood.

“It’s a beautiful thing,” she said as she looked at about 1,000 people in line to donate blood. “It’s just a beautiful thing.”

Schultz, who has lived in the area for 30 years, doesn’t know if she knows any of the victims.

“How do you run through a list of everyone you know? I just don’t know,” she said.

Equality Florida, the state’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization, set up a GoFundMe to support the victims of the shooting. In four hours, more than 5,000 people had donated more than $200,000.

“We are heartbroken and angry that senseless violence has once again destroyed lives in our state and in our country,” organization officials said in a statement on the page.

The shooting came one day after another high-profile shooting in Orlando.

On Friday, YouTube sensation and former “Voice” contestant Christina Grimmie, 22, was shot and killed after her concert in Orlando by a 27-year-old St. Petersburg man who later killed himself. Police said they believed the shooter came specifically to attack Grimmie.","ORLANDO, Fla. — In what is now the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, an assault rifle-wielding gunman fatally shot at least 50 people, and wounded 53 more, in a downtown Orlando gay ni…"

The mass murder at a gay venue in Florida by a US-born terrorist is heartbreaking and demands a firm, smart response.

The religion of killer Omar Mateen, a Muslim born in the States to Afghan parents, cannot be ignored when it appears he was radicalised and went on the rampage as an Islamist.

Yet the police and every reasonable person in the US know he is not representative of Muslims who will weep that their religion is perverted by deranged fanatics.

A calm response isn’t easy but it is necessary – or Donald Trump-style demonisation will divide America when the country needs to unite.

It goes without saying Trump’s ban on Muslims entering wouldn’t have stopped Mateen. A few days after the funeral of Muhammad Ali, a convert to Islam, we have witnessed the best and worst of religiously driven men.

Restricting gun ownership may not have stopped Mateen but America must also confront the fact that a culture of weapons makes it easier to murder and maim.",Voice of the Mirror says Donald Trump-style demonisation will divide America when the country needs to unite

Pride parade,"An Indiana man armed with assault rifles and explosive chemicals was arrested on his way to a gay pride event in Los Angeles, police said Sunday.

James Wesley Howell, 20, was arrested when Santa Monica police discovered three assault rifles, high capacity magazines and ammunition in his car, according to a news release from the Santa Monica Police Department. Investigators also recovered a five-gallon bucket ""with chemicals capable of forming an improvised explosive device,"" police said.

According to initial reports from Santa Monica police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks, Howell told officers he wanted to harm the gay pride event in West Hollywood that was taking place about 7 miles away later Sunday.

But Seabrooks later called those comments an ""inaccuracy,"" saying on Twitter that Howell only said that he was going to the event, not that he wanted to harm anyone.

Authorities encountered Howell while responding to a call about ""suspicious circumstances"" in Santa Monica shortly before 5 a.m. Police said Howell was reportedly knocking on a resident's door and window. Howell's vehicle was registered in Indiana.

Seabrooks also tweeted that there are no known connections between Howell's arrest and the mass shooting this weekend that killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Florida.

According to court records, Howell most recently lived in Jeffersonville, which is part of the Louisville metro area. He was arrested in Clark County in October 2015 on a felony charge of pointing a firearm and a misdemeanor charge of intimidation.

Court records show Howell pleaded guilty in April to the intimidation charge. The felony firearm charge was dismissed. Howell was sentenced to serve a year of probation. According to court records, he was to ""forfeit all weapons"" for the entirety of his probation period.

Three days after his plea in that case, Howell was indicted in Jefferson Circuit Court in Kentucky on charges of fleeing or evading police and reckless driving, according to court documents. Howell is scheduled for a hearing in that case next month. Further details about that case were not immediately available.

A man who attended middle school and high school with Howell told IndyStar that he was the quiet one in their class. He said Howell didn't talk much, but would get into arguments and fights with people over differences of opinions.

The man, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, told IndyStar that he couldn't really think of a situation in which Howell spoke about his opinions regarding the LGBT community.

Howell's arrest is still under investigation by the Santa Monica Police Department, which says it is collaborating with the FBI.

At least 50 people died and dozens more were injured after a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando early Sunday.

""The horrific act of hatred and terror in Orlando was an unfathomable attack upon all of humanity,"" Dayton said in a news release. ""Our hearts go out to the innocent victims of that heinous assault.

The I-35W bridge in Minneapolis is equipped with a computerized lighting system that allows the Minnesota Department of Transportation to light the bridge in almost any color, and it has previously been lit in various colors ""for significant regional and national events,"" Dayton's office announced Sunday. Rainbow colors are a symbol of the LGBT community.

Other Minnesota and Wisconsin politicians offered comments on the mass shooting:

“It is difficult to find words to express my sadness and shock at the horrific shooting in Orlando, and my heart breaks for everyone affected by this heinous act of terror,” said Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn. “While we are still learning the details of this tragedy, we do know this: Fifty innocent lives were barbarically taken from families who now have to face the reality of life without a loved one. They were murdered because they were at a gay club by someone with hate in his heart and an assault rifle in his hands. How many tragedies like this does this nation have to endure before we find the moral conviction to do something about gun violence?”

“My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the brave men and women who risked their lives to save others,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. ""My committee will work to support the federal role in investigating this terror attack and protecting against further threats. As Americans we must unite to defeat terrorism’s threat to our nation's security.”

“This is a sad day for Orlando and a sad day for America,"" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. ""Innocent people were slaughtered by a man who was motivated by hate and terror and extremism.

He reportedly pledged allegiance to Islamic State during a call to 911 before the attack at around 2am on Sunday morning (local time).

Social media has been flooded as celebrities, journalists, politicians and users express their sorrow and disdain. 'Pray for Orlando' began trending on Twitter and Facebook after the shooting, and Pulse nightclub urged people to “keep everyone in your prayers as we work through this tragic event” on its Facebook page.

Facebook enabled its Safety Check feature, allowing those in the area to confirm whether they’re safe, unsafe or outside the affected area.

It is the first time it has been employed in the United States.

“We hope people in the area find the tool a helpful way to let their friends and family know they are okay,” Facebook said in a statement.

Victims of the horrific shooting took to Facebook and Twitter as they alerted others to the events inside.

Brandon Wolf, a local resident, tweeted “Shooting at pulse. We hit in the bathroom. And we can’t find our friends.”",

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee went so far as to say Obama should “step down” for not using the term and Clinton should “get out of this race” if she won’t either.

“If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said in a statement. “Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen -- and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.”

Obama, speaking from the White House on Sunday, said the nightclub massacre in which 50 people were killed and at least 53 others were wounded is being investigated as an “act of terror,” though did not say whether it was tied to radical Islam.

The gunman, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, was heard shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News.

Mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Fox News has learned.

ISIS reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, though it’s unclear if the shooting was actually directed by the group or only inspired by it.

All these details, surrounding the deadliest terror attack on the U.S. homeland since 9/11, have fueled tensions in the presidential race at an already-combustible time.

Trump has faced intense criticism from members of both parties for his calls to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the U.S.

In the wake of the Orlando attack, Trump again defended his proposals, saying on Twitter: “What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough.”

Trump originally was planning to deliver a speech Monday in Manchester, N.H., focused on the Clintons.

In the wake of the Orlando attack, it will also focus on security and immigration issues, Fox News is told.

Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders also condemned the attack, while speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt.

Earlier Sunday, Clinton released a statement unequivocally calling the massacre an “act of terror.”

“For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home. It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,” she said.

She also called it an “act of hate” -- a term Obama also used -- since the attacker targeted an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. And she said the country needs to “keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.”

Meanwhile, a joint campaign rally with Clinton and Obama set for Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., has been postponed in light of the attack, according to a White House official.

Obama also ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff “as a mark of respect for the victims of the act of hatred and terror perpetrated on Sunday, June 12, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.”

Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, which will make additional resources available for local authorities.

He offered “thoughts and prayers” to all those affected by the attack, particularly the victims and their families, and praised the efforts of the first-responders.","The terror massacre at a packed Orlando nightclub reverberated across the presidential campaign trail Sunday, as the candidates condemned the deadliest shooting in U.S. history -- and Donald Trump ripped President Obama and Hillary Clinton for avoiding the term “radical Islam” in doing so."

The shooting, which left 50 dead and more than another 50 injured, took place at a Latin night at the gay club. Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said the intelligence community believes the shooter, Omar Mateen, had connections to ISIS.

Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, released a statement on Sunday afternoon: I join Americans in praying for the victims of the attack in Orlando, their families and the first responders who did everything they could to save lives. 



This was an act of terror. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are hard at work, and we will learn more in the hours and days ahead. For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home. It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values.



This was also an act of hate. The gunman attacked an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. To the LGBT community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country. I am one of them. We will keep fighting for your right to live freely, openly and without fear. Hate has absolutely no place in America. 



Finally, we need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals. This is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States and it reminds us once more that weapons of war have no place on our streets. 



This is a time to stand together and resolve to do everything we can to defend our communities and country. The remarks echoed those that President Obama made from the White House press briefing room earlier in the afternoon. Clinton and Obama have postponed a planned campaign rally together that had been scheduled for Wednesday, BuzzFeed News has learned. Following Trump's release of his statement, Clinton campaign communications director Jen Palmieri issued a statement, saying, ""This act of terror is the largest mass shooting in American history and a tragedy that requires a serious response. Hillary Clinton has a comprehensive plan to combat ISIS at home and abroad and will be talking to the American people in the coming days about steps she would take to keep the country safe."" Addressing Trump directly, Palmieri added, ""In contrast, Donald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes and self-congratulations. Trump has offered no real plans to keep our nation safe and no outreach to the Americans targeted, just insults and attacks. In times of crisis more than ever, Americans are looking for leadership and deserve better."" Clinton, earlier Sunday morning, had tweeted that she was waiting on more information, but called the attacks ""horrific."" About a half-hour later, Clinton also tweeted a Spanish-language version of the tweet.

On Meet the Press, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who continues to compete against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, pointed to sales of ""automatic weapons"" as a focus in the aftermath of the shooting. ""It's horrific, it's unthinkable. And just hopes go out to all those who were shot that they can recover,"" Sanders said. ""We should not be selling automatic weapons which are designed to kill people. We have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them, criminals, people who are mentally ill."" In a statement, Sanders added, ""[W]e extend our heartfelt condolences to the victims' families and loved ones and our thoughts are with the injured and the entire Orlando LGBTQ community.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan released a statement on Sunday evening, saying, ""It is horrifying to see so many innocent lives cut short by such cowardice. Tonight, and in the long days ahead, we will grieve with the families. We will thank the heroes. We will hope for a swift recovery for the injured."" He added: ""As we heal, we need to be clear-eyed about who did this. We are a nation at war with Islamist terrorists. Theirs is a repressive, hateful ideology that respects no borders. It is a threat to our people at home and abroad. Our security depends on our refusal to back down in the face of terror. We never will."" In a statement released earlier in Sunday, Ryan's Senate counterpart, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said, """"The nation's prayers are with the victims and their families in the wake of this terrible tragedy. We thank the citizens and first responders who helped rescue and save lives amidst horror and chaos. We will continue to monitor developments from local law enforcement and the FBI to determine the exact nature of this crime and whether it was connected to international terrorist groups.""

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who had run against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, referred to the shooter's ""warped ideology"" in speaking about the attacks on Sunday afternoon. ""They seek to intimidate us, they seek to terrorize us,"" he said, adding, ""They will not win"" — specifically noting that this will be so, regardless of ""sexual orientation."" Earlier, Rubio had called the killings a ""horrifying act of terror"" and urged locals to donate blood. Significant lines at blood donation centers were seen in the area on Sunday — despite the ongoing ban on blood donations from gay men who have had sex with men in the prior year.

Florida Sen. Bill Nelson released a statement early on Sunday afternoon, saying, ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of all the victims of this horrific attack in Orlando."" He added: ""I have spoken with the FBI and there appears to be a link to Islamic radicalism. I have conferred with additional sources and they think there is likely a connection with ISIS.

Mateen could prove a breaking point for his fellow anti-gun activists. As the debate eventually moves toward the Second Amendment, activists must answer how the most prevalent mass shooter in American history cleared background checks, medical examination, registration and dozens of hours of mandated training.

“We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well,” President Obama noted in a White House press conference today. The Administration’s typical pivot toward promoting background checks, health evaluations and related registration procedures will likely not see as much air time in the days ahead – for good reason.

Florida resident Omar S. Mateen was registered by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services as a private security officer with an additional Class G Firearm License. Compared to a standard civilian concealed carry permit issued by the same Department, Mateen was required to undergo the full battery of common gun control measures floated after mass shootings.

Before acquiring a Class G permit, Mateen completed the requirements for the prerequisite Class D protocol. The Basic Security Officer Training process requires the completion of a 40 hour course over four consecutive days by a school or instructor licensed by the State of Florida. Mateen had to clear a criminal background check to satisfy the requirements and be legally able to work in the United States. He was required to renew his Class D Security license annually. Breitbart Texas’ review of Mateen’s Class D record found that license number D2723758 was set to expire on September 14, 2017.

Mateen’s Class G firearm license was far more detailed. The gunman completed an additional 28 hours of guided instruction focusing on legal statutes governing the permit and responsibilities therein (12 hours); operational safety and firearm mechanics (8 hours); and a firearms qualification exam in a shooting range for eight hours. He passed a 96-round shooting proficiency battery. Thereafter, Mateen’s criminal background was reviewed again pursuant to the application and submitted to a separate medical evaluation that certified he had no conditions that “would preclude [Mateen] from performing duties in an armed capacity.”

Class G licensees must register proofs of identity, citizenship/legal residency and fingerprints with application documents as well. Like Class D holders, Class G requires annual proficiency testing as well. Omar Mateen’s Class G license (G2704169) would have expired on September 13, 2017.

When executing his duties under the Class G license, Mateen could carry up to two semiautomatic pistols or revolvers ranging from .38 to .45 ACP calibers.

The .223 caliber assault rifle and 9mm pistol used in the mass shooting were confirmed to be legally purchased by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in a tweet published Sunday afternoon.

The Wall Street Journal reported that beyond the Florida licensing requirements, both previous FBI probes into Mateen’s conduct and potential terrorist connections could not be verified a threat worthy of further action.

Thereafter, Mateen’s criminal background was reviewed again pursuant to the application and submitted to a separate medical evaluation that certified he had no conditions that “would preclude [Mateen] from performing duties in an armed capacity.”

Class G licensees must register proofs of identity, citizenship/legal residency and fingerprints with application documents as well. Like Class D holders, Class G requires annual proficiency testing as well. Omar Mateen’s Class G license (G2704169) would have expired on September 13, 2017.

When executing his duties under the Class G license, Mateen could carry up to two semiautomatic pistols or revolvers ranging from .38 to .45 ACP calibers.

The .223 caliber assault rifle and 9mm pistol used in the mass shooting were confirmed to be legally purchased by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in a tweet published Sunday afternoon.

The Wall Street Journal reported that beyond the Florida licensing requirements, both previous FBI probes into Mateen’s conduct and potential terrorist connections could not be verified a threat worthy of further action.

It's the irony of LGBT Americans' increasing visibility: With the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide last June and a national focus on transgender rights this spring, the LGBT community has become easier to target.

More than 250,000 Americans above age 12 were victims of hate crimes from 2007 to 2011, according to a 2013 study from the U.S. Department of Justice. Available numbers show lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and HIV-affected people are disproportionately the targets of hate crimes, including those where race, national origin or religion may also be a motivating factor. But only a third of all hate crimes are ever reported to law enforcement.

What's more, many hate crimes that are reported to law enforcement don't end up in the FBI's tally. A recent Associated Press investigation found that thousands of law enforcement agencies have failed to report hate crimes to the FBI. More than 2,700 city police and county sheriff's departments, or 17% of all agencies, have not submitted a single hate crime report in the past six years, according to the AP.

The Orlando shooting occurred during the month of Pride, when the LGBT community create awareness around discrimination, violence, politics and health-related issues. In addition to Sunday's shooting, police in Los Angeles arrested a man with guns and ammunition in his car who was allegedly planning to attend the city's Pride parade, and police in Washington, D.C. stepped up security at the celebrations there.

Fifty people were killed, and more than 50 others injured, registering as the deadliest mass shooting in United States history.

As Boston joins the rest of the world in mourning this morning’s events, opportunities for those in Massachusetts and throughout New England to help and aid the victims and families affected by this senseless tragedy have arisen.

According to Mayor Marty Walsh’s LGBT liaison within the Mayor’s Office, Boston Pride events have gone on as scheduled today, but with an increased police presence.

“Boston Pride extends our sympathies to the victims and families of the tragic Orlando nightclub massacre and we stand in unison with the LGBT community of Orlando to condemn this vicious act,” writes Boston Pride in a statement. “Boston Pride is working closely with Boston Police Department to ensure the safety and security of all the patrons of the block parties, which are annual events to celebrate Pride Week.”

A moment of silence was held at 4 p.m. this afternoon at scheduled block parties on St. James Avenue and in Jamaica Plain. Vigils have also been scheduled, one for today at 6 p.m. on Boston Common (at the Parkman Bandstand) and another tomorrow outside City Hall, also at 6 p.m..

How to donate to victim’s families

Equality Florida has created a GoFundMe page to aid victim’s of today’s shooting. More than $520,000 has been raised by 13,114 people in seven hours. The goal is $1 million.

Equality Florida writes: “Funds raised on this page will be going directly to the victims and families affected by the horrific shooting at Orlando’s Pulse Nightclub. Equality Florida is working with local organizations — who are also helping to raise funds — to ensure the money is distributed properly. Thank you for the support!”

As many news outlets are reporting, local Orlando facilities are overwhelmed by potential blood donors, with the OneBlood center reaching capacity. This afternoon, UniversalHub asked where people in Boston could donate blood to help the victims in Orlando, and commenters have listed several options, including contacts at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Children’s Blood Donor Center, and the blood donor program at Mount Auburn Hospital.

Even if the donations locally do not make it to Orlando, having blood banks fully stocked in the event of a future emergency can help saves lives.

The Concert Across America To End Gun Violence

Bill Janovitz of Buffalo Tom announced this morning he is involved with the Boston edition of a September 25 concert that will attempt to unify the country and take a stand against gun violence. “My joy from last night’s exuberant Buffalo Tom show at the Paradise lasted until learning the Orlando news this morning,” he writes. “My next show will be as part of this Concert Across America for gun control event, which I’m helping organize in Boston on September 25.”

The concerts will be widespread and held across the country, from coast to coast, in harmony, and likely live-streamed and/or broadcasted. Back in 2007, Congress designated September 25 as the National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims.

More information on this event will no doubt emerge in the coming weeks. Click the link for where things currently stand, and for information on how to help organize or participate.

Yeni Akit, a right-wing newspaper which has supported the likes of Al-Qaeda in the past, broke news of the attack with the headline: 'Death toll rises to 50 in bar where perverted homosexuals go!'

The headline has caused a backlash online, where it has been suggested that the exclamation mark indicates that the paper is celebrating the attack, rather than condemning it.

Yeni Akit has long supported Turkey's Justice and Development Party (AKP), which President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan used to lead.

The paper, whose name means 'New Agreement, is also known for having strong links to Erdogan, in a country where press freedom is being heavily restricted by his government.

According to Turkish think-tank the Hrant Dink Foundation, Yeni Akit is one of the worst offenders when it comes to using hate speech against minorities, in particular the LGBT community, but also against Jews, Armenians and Christians.

In just four months in 2013, when the foundation competed its last survey, they found 175 articles where hate speech was directed at one of eight separate minority groups.

At least 50 people were killed and another 53 wounded at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in the early hours of Sunday when gunman Omar Mateen, 29, from Port St. Lucie, opened fire.

Mateen, whose parents are of Afghan descent, took another 30 people hostage while wearing what is believed to have been a suicide vest, but was shot before he could detonate it.

SWAT officers used a controlled explosion to distract Mateen before shooting him dead in a hail of gunfire, with police chiefs saying their actions likely saved 'many lives.'

ISIS has since claimed responsibility for the attack, though it is unclear exactly what connection Mateen has to the group.

While Mateen called 911 shortly before the attack to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the spiritual leader of the terror group, security services say they have no evidence of contact between him and the organization prior to the attack.

Erdogan has been attempting to crack down on negative headlines about his administration in an attempt to bolster his increasingly unpopular reputation as many Turks feel his views do not represent their own.

According to Freedom House, an NGO which monitors democratic freedoms around the world, Turkish press freedom has deteriorated sharply over the past several years.

In 2015 alone, three journalists were killed in connection with their work, while dozens more were prosecuted by the government under anti-terrorism laws for reports critical of the government.

Erdogan was personally called out by the group for inciting violence against several publications, including one whose offices were attacked several times over the year.

Accreditation for journalists was also brought under further government control, allowing officials to handpick reporters for prominent positions.

Because of this, publications that are allowed to operate freely - such as Akit - are seen to be voicing the de-facto views of Erdogan and his regime.","Yeni Akit, a Turkish newspaper which has supported the likes of Al-Qaeda in the past and has ties with President Erdogan, broke news of the Orlando attack by calling victims 'perverts'."

There was heightened police presence and security in Los Angeles for Sunday’s LA Pride Festival in West Hollywood.

In Santa Monica, police arrested a man who said he was heading to the festival with car full of weapons, ammunition and chemicals that could be used in an explosive device. The suspect was identified as James Howell of Indiana. Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks tweeted that Howell had intended to “harm” the gay pride event, but later said the comments were inaccurate and that he was going to the festival, but he hadn’t stated his intent.

Officials said there is no connection between Howell and the attack in Orlando.

KCRW spoke to NBC Network news Investigative Reporter Andrew Blankstein about Howell and some of the confusion surrounding his arrest.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who walked the parade route Sunday told KCRW “I think it was a place of a lot of love at a moment when we needed it.”

Garcetti said that there were no credible threats in Los Angeles today, and underlined the need for better gun control laws in America.

Organizers of LA Pride almost cancelled the event after Howell was arrested in Santa Monica, however the festival continued and the parade continued through West Hollywood, where many expressed solidarity with those killed in Florida.

LA resident Rachel Schlosser told KCRW that the shooting at the Orlando gay club made her more committed to attending LA Pride. “Because the most important thing you can do when members of your community are attacked is to experience joy and celebrate as a member of that community,” said Schlosser, “It’s affirming and it shows strength.”

Gregg Brevoort, who was at the pride parade with his husband, said they’ve been going to pride for “years and years,” but considered staying home this year after hearing the news of the shooting, and about the Santa Monica arrest.

However, “you’ve got to keep going and live proudly and out there, and that’s what we’ve got to do,” Brevoort said. “We have a lot of work to do, it could have been any group.”

""Sue and I ask all Michiganders to join us in prayer for Orlando - victims, families, friends, and first responders. The people of Michigan stand with Florida.""

Snyder was one of several state officials to issue statements about the mass shooting.

One was from State Sen. David Knezek. a former U.S. Marine who fought in Iraq and supporter of the Second Amendment.

He's also a Democrat who represents Michigan's 5th District, which includes part of Wayne County that includes many Arab-Americans.

On Sunday, he said he was struggling to come to terms with the mass shooting in Orlando.

""What happened in Orlando has shaken me,"" he said in his statement. ""Politicians - people like me - will do one of two things now: offer up prayers and do absolutely nothing in response, or, renew their attacks on the entire Muslim community for the actions of a few. Both are irresponsible and dangerous paths to continue down.""

""I don't know what the answer is to gun violence in our country. I had extensive training on how and when to use it. I knew at all times that simply introducing a gun to a situation immediately heightens the emotions of it. I believe that I am a responsible gun user because the Marine Corps properly trained me to be one. It took years. Years. People in Michigan today can take an 8 hour class, fire 90, .22 caliber rounds, and they have the same access to a weapon as me. Some, and I know this happens, pay the right person off and they get the certification without ever having attended the course. Do they have the training, the knowledge, the combat mindset to know what holding a weapon in your hands really means? No. But they can get one, so easily, and they can inflict violence on people, mercilessly, like what was done this morning.

""Of course, this is where people will argue that someone can just illegally obtain a gun and commit these acts of violence anyway. A red herring in my belief. Anything and everything can be done illegally but we still have laws governing almost all of it. Too many of us live in a zero-sum world where it's all or nothing: if we can't stop EVERY gun death, we shouldn't enact laws that might stop SOME gun deaths. What a tragic mindset. This morning's shooter obtained his gun legally, despite being the subject of two FBI investigations. Think about that for a moment. Why, after such convincing evidence to the contrary, would we ever allow someone like that to obtain a gun legally? The gunman would have had a more difficult time getting a mortgage for a new house or buying a car. Could he have obtained a gun illegally? Maybe. But he didn't have to. Our system just put it in his hands. That is a broken system.

""I don't want to take guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens. I don't want to take guns out of the hands of sportsmen and women. I want to keep guns out of the hands of bad people. I want there to be realistic training that goes behind holding that weapon in your hand. We will never be perfect in that endeavor, but we are certainly failing right now. Surely, level heads can come together and find some sort of solution. Surely, some progress can be made. Surely?



""I don't know what the answer is to gun violence in our country but I do know that we are the only civilized country in the world where this happens. That should be our starting point - asking ""Why?"" Perhaps we can find answers. We aren't finding anything today. We aren't solving anything today. We aren't saving lives.

""To have this attack occur against members of the LGBT community hurts my heart in such a deep way. After the victories that have been had over the past few years, to now have the community associated with such an unspeakable act again should embolden us all to reaffirm our support and love for our LGBT brothers and sisters. ....

""Soon we will hear the rally cry against Muslims in our country and around the world. ... Fight ISIS? Yes. Kill ISIS? Yes. But condemn over a billion people for the actions of one or a few? No. Let us be better Americans than that.""

Knezek wasn't the only Michigan official to issue a statement today in connection with the mass shooting.

From Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette: ""My wife Cynthia and I, and indeed people across Michigan and America, extend our prayers to families who have lost loved ones in this brutal shooting in Orlando. At this moment, the tragic shootings in Orlando appear to be an act of domestic terrorism. Law enforcement officials are working diligently to obtain evidence of what caused this act of violence.""

Here's an excerpt from the statement issued by Bishop Paul J. Bradley of the Catholic Diocese of Kalamazoo: ""I extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those who have been killed, and our prayers for those who are fighting for their lives, even as we ask God's comfort and consolation to the families of all those who have been terrorized. I also invite every member of our Catholic community, along with all the wonderful people of good will in our wider community, even as we are struggling with the sadness of our own recent tragic circumstances, to pray for an end of violence, hatred and intolerance in our society. With God's grace and guidance, may we choose to live together in harmony and peace.""

From state Rep. Brandt Iden, R-Oshtemo: ""This type of senseless violence can not be tolerated within our communities across the nation. The bill I have been working on in the Michigan Legislature, House Bill 5442, has drawn support from both sides of the aisle and will implement a public threat alert system to notify people locally of mass shootings and other acts of terrorism.

""... Ensuring the safety of our citizens is a priority and we must enact laws that will help save lives and keep people aware of their surroundings so they can protect themselves and loved ones,"" Iden added. ""Information is power and the quicker we know what is going on around us the quicker we can respond and take caution to save lives. More lives do not need to be lost to prove that we, as a society, ought to be more engaged to effectively utilize our technological capabilities to our advantage.""

The Flint Islamic Center and Grand Blanc Islamic Center issued this joint statement: ""The FIC and GBIC communities offer our condolences to the victims of this heinous crime, to their families and to those who are injured. We reject violence, hatred, and discrimination toward anyone on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, religion, familial status, sexual orientation and national origin.""

This morning's shooter obtained his gun legally, despite being the subject of two FBI investigations. Think about that for a moment. Why, after such convincing evidence to the contrary, would we ever allow someone like that to obtain a gun legally? The gunman would have had a more difficult time getting a mortgage for a new house or buying a car. Could he have obtained a gun illegally? Maybe. But he didn't have to. Our system just put it in his hands. That is a broken system.

""I don't want to take guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens. I don't want to take guns out of the hands of sportsmen and women. I want to keep guns out of the hands of bad people. I want there to be realistic training that goes behind holding that weapon in your hand. We will never be perfect in that endeavor, but we are certainly failing right now. Surely, level heads can come together and find some sort of solution. Surely, some progress can be made. Surely?



""I don't know what the answer is to gun violence in our country but I do know that we are the only civilized country in the world where this happens. That should be our starting point - asking ""Why?"" Perhaps we can find answers. We aren't finding anything today. We aren't solving anything today. We aren't saving lives.

""To have this attack occur against members of the LGBT community hurts my heart in such a deep way. After the victories that have been had over the past few years, to now have the community associated with such an unspeakable act again should embolden us all to reaffirm our support and love for our LGBT brothers and sisters. ....

""Soon we will hear the rally cry against Muslims in our country and around the world. ... Fight ISIS? Yes. Kill ISIS? Yes. But condemn over a billion people for the actions of one or a few? No. Let us be better Americans than that.""

Knezek wasn't the only Michigan official to issue a statement today in connection with the mass shooting.

From Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette: ""My wife Cynthia and I, and indeed people across Michigan and America, extend our prayers to families who have lost loved ones in this brutal shooting in Orlando. At this moment, the tragic shootings in Orlando appear to be an act of domestic terrorism. Law enforcement officials are working diligently to obtain evidence of what caused this act of violence.""

Here's an excerpt from the statement issued by Bishop Paul J. Bradley of the Catholic Diocese of Kalamazoo: ""I extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those who have been killed, and our prayers for those who are fighting for their lives, even as we ask God's comfort and consolation to the families of all those who have been terrorized. I also invite every member of our Catholic community, along with all the wonderful people of good will in our wider community, even as we are struggling with the sadness of our own recent tragic circumstances, to pray for an end of violence, hatred and intolerance in our society. With God's grace and guidance, may we choose to live together in harmony and peace.""

From state Rep. Brandt Iden, R-Oshtemo: ""This type of senseless violence can not be tolerated within our communities across the nation. The bill I have been working on in the Michigan Legislature, House Bill 5442, has drawn support from both sides of the aisle and will implement a public threat alert system to notify people locally of mass shootings and other acts of terrorism.

""... Ensuring the safety of our citizens is a priority and we must enact laws that will help save lives and keep people aware of their surroundings so they can protect themselves and loved ones,"" Iden added. ""Information is power and the quicker we know what is going on around us the quicker we can respond and take caution to save lives. More lives do not need to be lost to prove that we, as a society, ought to be more engaged to effectively utilize our technological capabilities to our advantage.""

The Flint Islamic Center and Grand Blanc Islamic Center issued this joint statement: ""The FIC and GBIC communities offer our condolences to the victims of this heinous crime, to their families and to those who are injured. We reject violence, hatred, and discrimination toward anyone on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, religion, familial status, sexual orientation and national origin.""

“We have come a long way, and we were finally recognized by the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.” said honoree Pedro Julio Serrano, who was wearing a sash that said Orgullo Puertorriqueño, which means Puerto Rican Pride. “It is with a heavy heart that we march today, but we have to do it because this is our struggle.”

Serrano, an openly gay, HIV+ activist, is the executive director of Puerto Rico Para Tod@s, an LGBT advocacy group. He called the mass shooting an “unconscionable tragedy” felt throughout the Puerto Rican and LGBT communities.

The shooting at the Pulse night club in Orlando early Sunday morning left 50 dead and 53 injured. The City of Orlando, which has one of the biggest and rapidly increasing Puerto Rican populations in the country, has slowly been releasing the names of the deceased. Among them are Edward Sotomayor Jr., Stanley Almodovar III, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo and Juan Ramon Guerrero.

“This was an act of terror and an act of hate against LGBT people of color,” Serrano said. “This is not what humanity is about and we all should respect and love each other.”

Ricardo Jiménez, a former political prisoner of Puerto Rico for 20 years, marched in the parade with Serrano, congratulating the progress of LGBT inclusion in the parade.

“This is, in general, the homophobia and transphobia that exists in the U.S.,” Jiménez said. “This parade, is dedicated to us, and we are trying to avoid incidents like those. We need to condemn, fully, the situation that happened in Orlando.”

Karina Claudio Betancourt, who works with the Open Society Foundation and previously directed community engagement in New York City, walked in the parade in solidarity with Puerto Ricans dealing with the islands's financial crisis as well as LGBTQ people of color who still have to endure violence in the U.S.

“Many of the people that are leaving the island of Puerto Rico because of the debt crisis, and they are going to Orlando,” Betancourt said. “It was also Latino night at that club, so we lost a lot our brothers and sisters. Althought today is when we celebrate, we reflect on how homophobia and transphobia still kill us to this day.”

Despite the backdrop of the violent shootings in Orlando, Betancourt said the LGBT representation in the National Puerto Rican Day Parade is still historic and should be celebrated.

“Our LGBT brothers and sisters are finally being recognized, and we are finally able to march openly in the parade with our gay and trans* flags, showing our pride,” Betancourt said. “We can march with all of our identities together, our LGBT identities and our Puerto Rican identities.”

Brooke Cerda, a Mexican immigrant and transwoman, marched with the parade in solidarity with Puerto Ricans. With her fist clenched hard, Cerda took a stand against violence that LGBTQ people, especially trans people, face in the U.S.

“This is the largest mass shooting in the history of this country, and it happened to queer people,” Cerda said. “This shows exactly how vulnerable we still are. Yes, we have marriage equality, but how many people must be massacred like that, to die on the ground like a dog?”

When Cerda heard in the news that over 50 people were killed in Florida, she thought a hurricane came through and decimated Orlando.

“You don’t need a psychological exam before you get a gun, but in order for people like me to transition, we need a letter from a psychologist,” Cerda said. “In the U.S. you can get a gun, no questions asked. I am enraged.”","“It is with a heavy heart that we march today but we have to do it because this is our struggle,"" said an honoree at the Natl Puerto Rican Day Parade."

Mateen could prove a breaking point for his fellow anti-gun activists. As the debate eventually moves toward the Second Amendment, activists must answer how the most prevalent mass shooter in American history cleared background checks, medical examination, registration and dozens of hours of mandated training.

“We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well,” President Obama noted in a White House press conference today. The Administration’s typical pivot toward promoting background checks, health evaluations and related registration procedures will likely not see as much air time in the days ahead – for good reason.

Florida resident Omar S. Mateen was registered by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services as a private security officer with an additional Class G Firearm License. Compared to a standard civilian concealed carry permit issued by the same Department, Mateen was required to undergo the full battery of common gun control measures floated after mass shootings.

Before acquiring a Class G permit, Mateen completed the requirements for the prerequisite Class D protocol. The Basic Security Officer Training process requires the completion of a 40 hour course over four consecutive days by a school or instructor licensed by the State of Florida. Mateen had to clear a criminal background check to satisfy the requirements and be legally able to work in the United States. He was required to renew his Class D Security license annually. Breitbart Texas’ review of Mateen’s Class D record found that license number D2723758 was set to expire on September 14, 2017.

Mateen’s Class G firearm license was far more detailed. The gunman completed an additional 28 hours of guided instruction focusing on legal statutes governing the permit and responsibilities therein (12 hours); operational safety and firearm mechanics (8 hours); and a firearms qualification exam in a shooting range for eight hours. He passed a 96-round shooting proficiency battery. Thereafter, Mateen’s criminal background was reviewed again pursuant to the application and submitted to a separate medical evaluation that certified he had no conditions that “would preclude [Mateen] from performing duties in an armed capacity.”

Class G licensees must register proofs of identity, citizenship/legal residency and fingerprints with application documents as well. Like Class D holders, Class G requires annual proficiency testing as well. Omar Mateen’s Class G license (G2704169) would have expired on September 13, 2017.

When executing his duties under the Class G license, Mateen could carry up to two semiautomatic pistols or revolvers ranging from .38 to .45 ACP calibers.

The .223 caliber assault rifle and 9mm pistol used in the mass shooting were confirmed to be legally purchased by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in a tweet published Sunday afternoon.

The Wall Street Journal reported that beyond the Florida licensing requirements, both previous FBI probes into Mateen’s conduct and potential terrorist connections could not be verified a threat worthy of further action.

A lone gunman walked into an Orlando, FL nightclub and began shooting, killing at least 50 and wounding over 50 more. The Pulse nightclub is a gay establishment and according to authorities the shooter, identified as Omar Mateen, was well prepared and planned the attack.

Police in Orlando are calling it an act of terror, but as of yet a motive hasn’t been connected to the shooting.

Although the killer’s father told NBC news the killing didn’t involve religion, authorities now believe Mateen has pledged his support to ISIS before carrying the mass murder. They said he made a 911 call pledging his support to the terror group.

Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique, said Mateen had become enraged after seeing two men kissing in Miami.

According to Orlando Police Chief John Mina, Mateen was shot and killed by a SWAT team after taking hostages in the nightclub. He was armed with an assault rifle, a handgun and unspecified “devices.” Once the police arrived on the scene the shooter engaged in an extended gun battle with the police.

A lone gunman walked into an Orlando, FL nightclub and began shooting, killing at least 50 and wounding over 50 more. The Pulse nightclub is a gay establishment and according to authorities the shooter, identified as Omar Mateen, was well prepared and planned the attack.

Police in Orlando are calling it an act of terror, but as of yet a motive hasn’t been connected to the shooting.

Although the killer’s father told NBC news the killing didn’t involve religion, authorities now believe Mateen has pledged his support to ISIS before carrying the mass murder. They said he made a 911 call pledging his support to the terror group.

Mateen’s father, Mir Seddique, said Mateen had become enraged after seeing two men kissing in Miami.

According to Orlando Police Chief John Mina, Mateen was shot and killed by a SWAT team after taking hostages in the nightclub. He was armed with an assault rifle, a handgun and unspecified “devices.” Once the police arrived on the scene the shooter engaged in an extended gun battle with the police.

Mateen was born to Afghan parents in New York City, and the family moved to Port St. Lucie in Florida.
