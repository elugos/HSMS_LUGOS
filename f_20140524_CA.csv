Late Saturday, CBS affiliate KEYT obtained what it said was Elliot Rodger's 141-page manifesto, called ""My Twisted World.""

It says, ""This is the story of my entire life. It is a dark story of sadness, anger and hatred.""

On Saturday, a family attorney said Elliot Rodger's parents long had concerns about their son's mental health.

""He had multiple, and I'm telling you multiple, therapists,"" Alan Shifman said. ""He had a social worker who as recently as last week was concerned and who's the one that actually called the police.""

Speaking in front of Peter Rodger's home, Shifman told reporters that the shooter's family alerted authorities after Elliot Rodger posted a series of disturbing, ranting messages on YouTube.

""They reported this weeks ago,"" Shifman said. ""There was an investigation by the police department.""

Shifman said Elliot Rodger had been diagnosed at a young age with Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, but did not have a history of gun use.

Shifman also said the family was devastated and would cooperate in any way possible with investigators and police.

""This is the tragedy of the most extreme,"" Shifman said. ""They want to send their deepest condolences to all of the victims' families involved.""","A life of ""sadness, anger and hatred,"" according to manifesto said to be the suspected shooter's"

A rant-filled YouTube video posted by the alleged gunman has also come into the spotlight.

Peter Rodger, an assistant director for the blockbuster 'Hunger Games' movie franchise, says his family believes his 22-year-old son, Elliot Rodger, was the gunman who shot dead six people late on Friday.

""On behalf of the Rodgers family, they want to make sure that the victims and the victims' families are aware that this is the tragedy of the most extreme,"" said Rodger's lawyer Alan Shifman.

""They want to send their deepest condolences to all of the victims' families involved.""

Authorities have not confirmed the identity of the shooter, who is deceased.

The lone gunman sprayed bullets from a car in a drive-by shooting in Isla Vista, near the campus of the University of California Santa Barbara. The rampage left six people dead, and seven people hospitalized with gunshot wounds or other major injuries.

The gunman was found dead behind the wheel of his crashed BMW with a gunshot wound to the head. It was unclear whether the shot was self-inflicted or from sheriff's deputies, who twice exchanged fire with the gunman.

A semi-automatic handgun was recovered from the scene.

""The problem with an incident like this is it's obviously the work of a madman,"" Brown said.

""We have obtained and we are currently analyzing both written and videotaped evidence that suggests this atrocity was a premeditated mass murder.""

Witnesses described how a black BMW sped through the streets spraying bullets. One witness, Xavier Mozejewski, told a California-based television station that the incident was like an ""old Western shoot-out.""

Shifman, the Rodger family attorney, said Elliot Rodger had been receiving treatment by ""multiple"" professionals since being diagnosed as a ""highly functional Asperger's Syndrome child.""

Shifman said the family called police several weeks ago, expressing their alarm over YouTube videos apparently posted by Elliot Rodger ""regarding suicide and the killing of people.""

One video, titled ""Retribution,"" shows a man in a car who tells of being rejected by women, and later vows to ""punish you all for it.""

Police said Saturday that 20-year-old Christopher Ross Michael-Martinez was the last of six people killed by suspect Elliot Rodger near the University of California, Santa Barbara before the gunman apparently shot and killed himself.

Michael-Martinez's father Richard Martinez says he talked to his son, a sophomore at UC Santa Barbara, just 45 minutes before he was killed.

The father choked back tears as he talked to reporters before a news conference, saying ""When will this insanity stop?""

Martinez then shouted ""we should say to ourselves 'not one more!' "" before dissolving into tears.

He blamed politicians and the National Rifle Association for allowing guns to be so accessible.

All the guns used in the attack reportedly purchased legally in the Santa Barbara area.

Elliot Rodger, 22, described as the British-born son of a film director, died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound in the black BMW car from which he had fired as he drove around an Isla Vista campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara. Police said that three of those killed had been stabbed to death while three were shot.

On Saturday afternoon the father of one of the people shot dead delivered to camera a furious statement in which he blamed “craven, irresponsible politicians and the National Rifle Association”.



Five more people were injured on Friday night. Police said four of them were struck by the suspect’s car.

On Saturday evening Dr Stephen Kaminski of the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital said four injured people had been treated and released and seven had been transferred to a trauma centre. Of those individuals two were in good condition, three in fair condition and two in serious condition.

Santa Barbara County sheriff Bill Brown said three men had been killed in Rodger’s apartment prior to the beginning of the shooting spree. They were stabbed “repeatedly with a sharp object” in “a horrific crime scene”. The identities of the three had not been not released pending identification and notification of kin.



The three shot dead were named as Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19, UCSB students who were shot outside a sorority house, and Christopher Ross Michael-Martinez, 20, another UCSB student who was shot at a delicatessen.

Earlier, disclosing Rodger’s identity, Alan Shifman, an attorney for the Hollywood director Peter Rodger, Elliot Rodger’s father, said: “The Rodger family offers their deepest compassion and sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy. We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain and our hearts go out to everybody involved.”

Peter Rodger was described in reports as having been educated in Maidstone, Kent, in the UK and worked as an assistant director on the blockbuster Hunger Games series.

Brown, the sheriff, detailed criminal activity that he said had taken place at 10 crime scenes. He said three semi-automatic handguns – two Sig Sauer P226s and a Glock 34 Long Slide – had been retrieved from the car, along with more than 400 rounds of ammunition.



Addressing a press conference, Brown said all the guns had been legally purchased from federally licensed dealers and registered to Rodger.



Brown also detailed three previous contacts between Rodger and law enforcement authorities. The first, in July 2013, involved an alleged assault on Rodger in which it was suspected he may have been the aggressor and the case was suspended. The second, in January 2014, saw Rodger make a citizen’s arrest of a roommate he alleged had stolen three candles worth $22.

On 30 April, Brown said, deputies made contact with Rodger to check on his welfare after a request from a family member. Brown said it had been “determined that he did not meet the criteria for an involuntary mental health hold”.

Rodger’s identity was first confirmed by his family earlier on Saturday after a series of YouTube videos, including one posted on Friday and entitled Elliot Rodger's Retribution, became subject to intense public attention and speculation.

The video showed a young man who said he was a 22-year-old virgin, complaining that women had rejected him.



""I will have my revenge against humanity,"" he said, vowing to kill students and Isla Vista residents. ""I will punish all of you for it.""

The account that posted the video contained 20 clips, including the titles “Why do girls hate me so much?”,“Life is so unfair because girls don't want me” and “My reaction to seeing a young couple at the beach, Envy”.

The videos, which a family lawyer said had been reported to police and investigated, were taken down on Saturday afternoon.

Brown later confirmed that Rodger had also written a “141-page, rambling … combination of an autobiography and a diary” which the sheriff said made it “very clear how disturbed Mr Rodger was”.



Brown added: “The fact that he had been and was continuing to be seen by a number of healthcare professionals makes it very, very apparent that he was very mentally disturbed when he made that document.



“The video tapes were chilling,” Brown said. “The one he posted just prior to the attack was a particularly chilling one, in which he basically looks at the camera and talks about what he is about to do.”



In his statement about the death of his son, Richard Martinez said: “Our family has a message for every parent out there. You don’t think it will happen to your child until it does.

“Chris was a really great kid. Ask anyone who knew him. His death has left our family lost and broken.



“Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.



“They talk about gun rights. What about Chris’s right to live? When will this insanity stop? When will enough people say, ‘Stop this madness, we don’t have to live like this.’ Too many have died.



His voice rising, Martinez concluded: “We should say to ourselves: Not one more.”","Six people and the suspect dead after Isla Vista spree in which three victims were shot and three stabbed, police say"

Here are five things to know about the attack:

Gunfire began pouring out of a black BMW around 9:30 p.m. Friday in the tiny community of Isla Vista, next to the university. By the end of the night, seven people were killed in all, including the gunman. Witnesses reported hearing a barrage of gunfire, and one told a TV station that the gunman flashed his weapon at her moments before she felt bullets whizzing by her head. The shooter was involved in two gunbattles with police before he crashed his car. He was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head. It’s unclear if he committed suicide or was killed by police.

WHO WAS THE SHOOTER?

The family of Elliot Rodger, 22, believes he was the man who went on the shooting rampage, Alan Shifman, an attorney for Rodger’s father, Peter, said Saturday. “The Rodger family offers their deepest compassion and sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy. We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain, and our hearts go out to everybody involved,” Shifman said. Peter Rodger was an assistant director on “The Hunger Games.”

Law-enforcement officers have not identified Rodger as the suspect, however.

WHAT ABOUT THE YOUTUBE VIDEO?

There remain many unanswered questions about a seven-minute-long YouTube video in which a man outlines his plans for violent revenge because of repeated rejection from women. Police are analyzing the video as part of their investigation, but the identity of the person who made it couldn’t be independently confirmed. In it, the man sits in the driver’s seat of a car and threatens to kill sorority girls and people on the streets of Isla Vista. He said college has been a “torturous” experience for him and said at the age of 22 he had never kissed a girl and was a virgin. Shifman said the family called police several weeks ago after they were alarmed by YouTube videos about suicide and murders. It’s unclear whether the videos are related.

WHO WAS KILLED AND INJURED?

Authorities have not identified those who were killed. In a statement, the University of California, Santa Barbara said it’s “shocked and saddened” by the shootings. The university said several students were shot and taken to the hospital.

The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office is leading the investigation. “It’s obviously the work of a madman,” Sheriff Bill Brown said.",5 things to know about shooting near UC Santa Barbara

""This incident appears to be a mass murder situation,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told a televised news conference. ""We currently have seven people confirmed dead, that includes the suspect and six victims.""

The sheriff also said deputies twice exchanged fire with the gunman before his vehicle crashed and he was found dead inside from a gunshot wound to the head.

""We have obtained and are currently analyzing both written and videotaped evidence that suggests this atrocity was a premeditated mass murder,"" Brown said, describing the shooting as ""obviously the work of a madman.""

Witnesses described seeing a black BMW car speeding through the streets spraying bullets at people and other targets in the college town.

One witness, Xavier Mozejewski, told a California-based television station that the incident was like an ""old Western shoot-out.""

College student Brad Martin also told a student newspaper that his girlfriend was ""absolutely hysterical"" after being approached by the gunman, who was holding a weapon she wasn't sure was real at first.

""She said the next second he raised it up to her face... and she turned around and started running. That's when she heard ""bang, bang, bang"" right behind her as she was running,"" he told the Daily Nexus.

Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said the dead in the rampage in the Isla Vista neighbourhood included the suspected attacker, who was driving a black BMW.

Earlier, he said the suspect exchanged gunfire with deputies before crashing into a parked car. He did not know if the suspect was shot by deputies, or if his wound was self-inflicted.

Mr Brown said the shootings took place at several sites in the town, resulting in nine crime scenes, and the circumstances are under investigation.

Isla Vista is known for parties, including an annual spring bash which turned into a violent blowout last month as young people clashed with police and threw rocks and bottles. A university police officer and four deputies were injured and 130 people were arrested.","Seven people have been killed and seven others injured in drive-by shootings in a student enclave next to the University of California in Santa Barbara, authorities said today.

Elliot Rodger, the son of a Hollywood director, stabbed three people to death in his apartment on Friday night before gunning down three more victims in the town of Isla Vista near the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara.

A killing spree, in which Rodger opened fire on bystanders as he terrorized Isla Vista in his car and on foot, ended when he took his life after a shootout with sheriff's deputies, police said. Authorities found three guns that Rodger had legally purchased and more than 400 rounds of unspent ammunition in his car.

In a threatening YouTube video, a young man presumed by police to be Rodger bitterly complains of loneliness and rejection by women and lays out plans to kill those he believes spurned him.

""It's obviously the work of a madman,"" Sheriff Bill Brown told a news conference about the rampage, adding it was ""very, very apparent he was severely mentally disturbed.""

Witnesses reported seeing someone driving a black BMW through the streets and shooting at people in the beachside community where many college students live. At least 13 people were wounded, including eight who were shot.

Brown said his department had three times been in contact with Rodger prior to the killings, including once after a family member asked them to check on his welfare last month. Deputies interviewed Rodger but found him to be polite and courteous and took no further action, Brown said.

Rodger had previously gone to authorities earlier in the year to report a roommate had stolen some candles, and last year reported he was the victim of an assault. Authorities said they later suspected he may have been the aggressor.

""We offer our deepest, compassionate sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy,"" lawyer Alan Shifman told reporters outside the family home in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, reading from a prepared statement on behalf of the family.

""We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain and our hearts go out to everyone involved,"" he added. Rodger is the son of Peter Rodger, an assistant director on the 2012 film ""The Hunger Games.""

The YouTube video police were studying shows a young man who identified himself as Elliot Rodger pouring out his hatred of women who have rejected him and ""popular kids,"" and threatening to kill people out of loneliness and sexual frustration.

""You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me. But I will punish you all for it. It's an injustice, a crime,"" he said in the video, his speech punctuated by bursts of laughter.

The video appeared to have been uploaded to YouTube on Friday night, shortly before the shooting. ""It would appear that is connected,"" Brown said.

YouTube has since removed the clip, saying videos threatening violence are against its guidelines and are removed when flagged.

Among the dead in the rampage were at least three college students, including two women gunned down as they stood outside a sorority and a man shot and killed in a delicatessen, Brown said. Three more men were stabbed to death in Rodger's apartment, but their identities were not released.

Richard Martinez told reporters that his 20-year-old son Christopher, an English major who wanted to go to law school, was the victim killed at the deli.

""Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA,"" an emotional Martinez told reporters outside the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. ""They talk about gun rights. What about Chris' right to live? When will this insanity stop?""

Robert Johnson, a 21-year-old UCSB student, said he first noticed trouble after a car drove past him at a busy Isla Vista intersection and he then heard ""popping noises"" that he originally mistook for firecrackers or the car backfiring.

""Then the sound came again, and by that point it had pulled up in front of a convenience store deli, and someone in the car was firing into a crowd of about eight, 10 people that were gathered in front of the store,"" he said.

""Everyone that was being fired upon, they all jumped and scrambled to run inside the store,"" he said.

The car had darkly tinted windows and the occupant was not visible, Johnson said.

College student Brad Martin told a UCSB student newspaper that his girlfriend was ""absolutely hysterical"" after being approached by the gunman with a weapon she initially was not sure was real.

""She said the next second he raised it up to her face ... and she turned around and started running,"" Martin told the Daily Nexus. ""That's when she heard 'bang, bang, bang' right behind her as she was running.""

University of California President Janet Napolitano, formerly U.S. secretary of Homeland Security, said she was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the shooting near the campus.

""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of this tragedy, their families and the entire Santa Barbara community,"" she said in a statement.

The incident was the latest mass shooting in the United States, where schools, shopping malls and military bases have been scenes of such crimes.

Last month, a gunman killed three people and himself at the Fort Hood U.S. Army base in Texas, where another gunman killed 13 people in 2009.

In December 2012, 20 children and six adults were killed in a mass shooting at an elementary school in Connecticut, six months after a gunman killed 14 people in a Colorado movie theater.

The deadliest U.S. mass shooting in modern times was in 2007, when a student at Virginia Tech killed 32 people in a shooting spree.

Some 23,000 people live in Isla Vista. Many are students at UCSB, which has an enrollment of about 22,000, or at Santa Barbara City College.",

Britain's Foreign Office said it has decided to recall a Royal Air Force plane which had been due to search for the Cheeki Rafiki's four missing crew for one more day, after the U.S. Coast Guard also called off its search.

A helicopter spotted the overturned hull of the 39-foot (12-meter) yacht roughly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) off the coast of Massachusetts on Friday, days after the crew reported trouble and disappeared on May 16.

Underwater images captured by a Navy swimmer showed the raft was still stowed in its storage space, indicating that there is almost no chance of finding the four missing sailors alive.

""We are obviously shocked and deeply saddened by the news,"" the family of skipper Andrew Bridge, 22, said in a statement. ""Andrew will be dearly missed by everyone who knew him.""

The families of the other three crew members — James Male, 23, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56 — have requested privacy.

The Cheeki Rafiki had been returning to England from a regatta in Antigua. Coast Guard officials said extreme sea conditions at the time of the distress call put the crew's estimated survival time at 20 hours.

A Navy swimmer found the boat's cabin completely flooded and its windows shattered. Simpson said the swimmer also knocked on the hull and reached below the waterline but got no response.

The search covered more than 20,000 square miles (51,800 square kilometers) and involved American, British and Canadian vessels and aircraft.

The British Foreign Office said it had informed the missing sailors' families of the hull's discovery. The Foreign Office said earlier Friday that the families were ""saddened to hear that the US Coast Guard will be suspending the search. But they were prepared for the fact that this would have to happen.""

(Chicago Tribune, May 24, 2014)- The gunman in the Isla Vista, California, shootings has been identified as Elliot Rodger, a 22-year-old student at a city college who had three previous contacts with local law enforcement, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters on Saturday in a second press conference.

“This incident appears to be a mass murder situation,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told a televised news conference Saturday morning. “We currently have seven people confirmed dead. That includes the suspect and six victims.” Thirteen more were injured — four injured by the suspect’s car and eight sustained gun shot wounds.

“It is very, very apparent the the suspect was severely mentally disturbed,” Brown said.

According to officials, the shooting spree began at the suspect’s residence when three males were murdered. The victims at the home were repeatedly stabbed.

Authorities said Rodger, the alleged suspect, would go to 10 separate locations before the mass shooting came to an end. Following the stabbings, the suspect drove to a sorority, where he shot three female UCSB students walking on a sidewalk opposite the structure. Two of those victims died — one 22-years-old, the other was identified as Veronika Weiss, 19. The third female suffered multiple gun shot wounds.

The suspect, a student at Santa Barbara City College, then moved on to a nearby deli, where he left his vehicle to shoot 20-year-old Christopher Martinez — another UCSB student. Sheriff deputies saw the shooting suspect flee the scene in his car when they went to investigate shots fired. The suspect continued to drive around shooting at pedestrians. Before the shooting ended, two bicyclists were struck with his vehicle.

Brown said deputies twice exchanged fire with the suspected gunman before his vehicle crashed. During one of the exchanges, the suspect was shot in the hip area. The spree came to an end when Rodger crashed his car into parked vehicles. At that time, officials said the suspect was pulled from the vehicle with a gun shot to the head.

“It would appear he took his own life at this point,” Brown said.

(AP) — Two sex offenders charged with raping and killing four California women while wearing GPS monitors had escaped parole supervision and left the state together more than once in the four years before their most recent arrest, The Associated Press learned Friday.

Steven Dean Gordon, 45, and Franc Cano, 27, were arrested together out-of-state in 2010 and 2012 after escaping parole supervision, according to public records and officials. They were again together when they were arrested in April and charged with working in tandem to sexually assault and murder four California women, raising questions about the effectiveness of their parole supervision.

Earlier this month, Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, asked the inspector general of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to review the monitoring of both men, as well as to review the overall monitoring of sex offender parolees and, in particular, homeless parolees. Both Cano and Gordon were homeless.

“It’s awful. It makes me furious,” said Jodi Pier-Estepp, the mother of victim Jarrae Nykkole Estepp said Friday when told of the earlier arrest. “If California was doing their job, my daughter would still be alive and so would those other girls.”

In 2010, Cano cut off his GPS device and fled to Alabama, where he was arrested with Gordon, said Luis Patino, spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Parole records obtained by the AP under a state Public Records Act request show he and Gordon were sent back to prison for five months.

The two repeated the feat again two years later, when both clipped off their electronic ankle bracelets and took a bus to Las Vegas using assumed names. They stayed at the Circus Circus Hotel & Casino for two weeks before they were arrested, according to court documents.

Both men pleaded not guilty this week in Orange County to raping and killing Estepp and three other women.

Defense lawyers representing Gordon and Cano now and the lawyers who represented them at the parole board hearing in 2010 did not immediately return phone messages or emails seeking comment Friday evening.

The GPS devices are not intended to prevent crime among those wearing them and parole agents would have no way of knowing the two were together, said Patino, the corrections spokesman. The system worked as it should because they returned to jail after being discovered and arrested, Patino said.

“There is a certain myth about what GPS monitoring can do,” Patino said. “It gives us a track of where that person was at any particular time, but there is no alarm that goes off if one GPS monitor comes within a proximity of the other,” he said.

A spokesman for Steinberg, the state lawmaker, said the latest details on the duo’s supervision underscored his earlier concerns about the use of GPS.

“The expensive GPS monitoring program was sold to California voters as a way to prevent crimes among formerly-incarcerated sex offenders. Senator Steinberg has sought a statewide review of the policy because of his long held concerns about the program’s ability to deliver on that promise,” spokesman Rhys Williams said in an emailed statement.

Parole documents show Cano was charged at his parole board hearing on Nov. 24, 2010, with absconding from supervision for a month, traveling over 50 miles and being arrested with another sex offender. He was arrested in Alabama. Gordon was charged the same day with absconding from parole supervision and failure to report his address.

Authorities say data from the GPS monitors helped link the pair to the slaying of Estepp, whose body was found at an Anaheim trash-sorting plant in March and the disappearance of three women in Orange County last year. Police are also investigating the men in the possible death of a fifth woman.

While Cano was still being tracked by state parole agents, Gordon was discharged from state parole in November and was being tracked for life by federal probation agents, officials said.",Two sex offenders charged with raping and killing four women had fled the the state.

A rant-filled YouTube video posted by the alleged gunman has also come into the spotlight.

Peter Rodger, an assistant director for the blockbuster 'Hunger Games' movie franchise, says his family believes his 22-year-old son, Elliot Rodger, was the gunman who shot dead six people late on Friday.

""On behalf of the Rodgers family, they want to make sure that the victims and the victims' families are aware that this is the tragedy of the most extreme,"" said Rodger's lawyer Alan Shifman.

""They want to send their deepest condolences to all of the victims' families involved.""

Authorities have not confirmed the identity of the shooter, who is deceased.

The lone gunman sprayed bullets from a car in a drive-by shooting in Isla Vista, near the campus of the University of California Santa Barbara. The rampage left six people dead, and seven people hospitalized with gunshot wounds or other major injuries.

The gunman was found dead behind the wheel of his crashed BMW with a gunshot wound to the head. It was unclear whether the shot was self-inflicted or from sheriff's deputies, who twice exchanged fire with the gunman.

A semi-automatic handgun was recovered from the scene.

""The problem with an incident like this is it's obviously the work of a madman,"" Brown said.

""We have obtained and we are currently analyzing both written and videotaped evidence that suggests this atrocity was a premeditated mass murder.""

Witnesses described how a black BMW sped through the streets spraying bullets. One witness, Xavier Mozejewski, told a California-based television station that the incident was like an ""old Western shoot-out.""

Shifman, the Rodger family attorney, said Elliot Rodger had been receiving treatment by ""multiple"" professionals since being diagnosed as a ""highly functional Asperger's Syndrome child.""

Shifman said the family called police several weeks ago, expressing their alarm over YouTube videos apparently posted by Elliot Rodger ""regarding suicide and the killing of people.""

One video, titled ""Retribution,"" shows a man in a car who tells of being rejected by women, and later vows to ""punish you all for it.""

Here's Why,"The entire state of California is in a severe drought. Farmers and farmworkers are hurting.

You might expect this to cause food shortages and higher prices across the country. After all, California grows 95 percent of America's broccoli, 81 percent of its carrots and 99 percent of the country's artichokes, almonds and walnuts, among other foods.

Yet there's been no sign of a big price shock. What gives?

Here are three explanations.

Drive southwest from Fresno, and you can easily see the drought's impact. In this area, farmers rely on the Westlands Water District for irrigation.

In a normal year, Westlands delivers water to each farm through a network of underground pipes. That water is drawn from artificial rivers that link this area to dams and reservoirs hundreds of miles away, mostly in the northern part of the state.

This year, because of the drought, Westlands cannot deliver any of that water. And the result is bare dirt where vegetables normally would grow.

Sarah Woolf takes me on a tour of her family's farm, and points toward one dry field. ""It had onions in it last year, and we're not farming it at all, because we don't have enough water supply,"" she says. (Woolf is also on the board of the Westlands Water District.)

But that's not the whole story in this region. I still see plenty of green: fields of alfalfa and garlic and leafy almond orchards.

They exist because many farmers here have a backup supply of water. They're pumping it out of underground aquifers.

This is happening all across the state. According to a new report from the University of California, Davis, the extra water that farmers will pump from their wells this year will make up for about 75 percent of the cutbacks in water from dams and reservoirs.

But this can't go on forever: That groundwater is limited. Woolf tells me that just this morning, she heard about problems at one of their wells. ""We have to actually drill down and drop the well deeper, which is a very bad sign,"" she says. It means that the water table is dropping; the aquifer is drying up.

2. Some parts of California are less dry than others.

Agriculture in California is spread around different parts of the state. One key region is the Salinas Valley, sometimes called America's salad bowl.

""In June, 90 percent of the lettuce in the United States is grown in the Salinas Valley,"" says Daniel Sumner, an economist at UC Davis. Yet there's ""no effect of the drought yet in the Salinas Valley.""

Those farms don't get water from California's dams and reservoirs, even in a normal year. They've always been able to rely on wells, and nothing's changed this year.

So fear not; there's plenty of baby spinach and mesclun mix.

In the winter, meanwhile, salad greens mostly come from areas far to the south, near the Mexican border. Those areas get their water from the Colorado River, which is also in relatively good shape this year thanks to snowfall far upstream.

3. The limited water is going to crops that consumers are most likely to notice.



Allen Peterson farms land near the town of Turlock, on the east side of the Central Valley. He grows mostly almonds, but also some corn and alfalfa, which he sells to dairy farmers nearby.

An irrigation canal runs right past his orchards. It's a concrete channel 18 feet wide and 6 feet deep, full of water.

That water supply is relatively secure; it comes straight from Lake Don Pedro, created by a dam that the Turlock Irrigation District helped to build. So Peterson is still getting about half of his normal allotment of water. It's enough to grow a crop, but not on every acre.

""I've kept water on our almond crop, which is a higher-value crop. I've left fallow some corn ground, to make sure I have enough water for my almonds,"" Peterson says.

That means he won't have corn to sell to his neighbors, the dairy farmers. Those dairy farmers are suffering from the drought. They're bringing in feed from far away, and it's expensive. Farmers in California are also growing less rice.

In other words, water is flowing toward food that consumers eat directly, because that's where the money is. Those also tend to be crops that California dominates. Less water is going toward production of crops like alfalfa or rice, which are available from other places or that consumers don't eat directly.

As a consequence, consumers are shielded from the drought's effects.

Sumner, the agricultural economist, says this is economics in action. ""People move the water to its highest-value use. People pay attention to markets. If you can't get something from California, you get it from somewhere else. That's what markets do. They're good at it,"" he says.

Of course, the drought is having an effect, just not a big one so far. A few farms have bulldozed almond and citrus trees because of water shortages. It's possible that citrus prices will rise next winter, because of shortfalls in production.

If the drought continues into next year, meanwhile, some of the current coping strategies may not work so well. The unrestricted use of groundwater is increasingly controversial. Some water experts are calling for limits on the amounts of water that farmers can draw from underground aquifers.

As it did in its first California action against Samsung in 2012, Apple is looking to leverage a jury's recent decision to net a permanent injunction of Samsung devices found in infringement of three patents. The company is also requesting a complete retrial of the damages case that ended in a $119.6 million award, much less than the $2.2 billion Apple was seeking.

On the issue of a permanent injunction, Apple is asserting that the continued sales of Samsung's infringing products would cause the company irreparable harm that cannot be remedied with monetary damages.

As noted by FOSS Patents' Florian Mueller, even if Apple wins an injunction, Samsung will likely be able to apply quick workarounds to skirt infringed patent claims.

Further, Apple v Samsung presiding Judge Lucy Koh already denied an injunction in the first California case, saying Apple's evidence did not sufficiently prove irreparable harm. Considering the current injunction is based on a similar piece of evidence, namely a conjoint consumer survey conducted by MIT professor John Hauser, the granting of an injunction from Koh would be surprising.

As for Apple's bid for a retrial, the company entered a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) seeking an order that additional Samsung products infringe certain patents, treble damages of the largest damages decision awarded by the jury or, in lieu of the previous, a complete retrial.

Described below in the 54-page filing, the request for a retrial applies to proposed motions for Samsung product injunctions and higher damages payouts relating to found infringed patents. These include the '647 data detectors, the '721 patent for ""slide-to-unlock"" functionality and the '172 patent for text prediction.

In addition, the filing states that ""Samsung's improper and prejudicial statements to the jury warrant a new trial on infringement for the '414 and '959 patents (in the event that the Court does not grant JMOL of infringement), a new trial on willfulness for all patents other than the '721 patent (and also other than the '647 patent if the Court grants JMOL of willfulness for that patent), and a new trial on damages for all five of Apple's asserted patents.""

While unlikely to be granted, Apple's last request seems to illustrate the company's displeasure of the jury's $119.6 million decision. The action contrasts a decidedly positive statement Apple issued after the verdict was handed down earlier this month.

Finally, Samsung also filed its own JMOL on Friday and, while the documents are sealed, Mueller believes the company is looking to reverse some or all of the jury's findings.","In two separate court filings on Friday, Apple lodged a motion for a permanent U.S. injunction on Samsung products found in infringement of certain utility patents by a jury earlier in May, while requesting a retrial of the same case."

Witnesses reported seeing a black BMW speeding through the town and spraying bullets at people and other targets. Police said there were nine crime scenes as a result of the shooting.

Isla Vista is a pleasant beachside community which is home to many college students and has a reputation for its lively parties.

Brown said investigators know the suspect's name but will not release it before all relatives are notified,

He said police were familiar with a YouTube video entitled Elliot Rodger's Retribution, in which a man says he is aged 22 and vows revenge on women, with whom he says he has never had an intimate experience.

Peter Rodger, assistant director of the film The Hunger Games, believes his son - who was born in Britain - was the attacker, his lawyer said.

Witness Xavier Mozejewski said the incident was like an ""old western shoot-out.""

College student Brad Martin told a University of California student newspaper that his girlfriend was ""absolutely hysterical"" after being approached by the gunman.

Seven more people were wounded in the Friday attack in the town of Isla Vista near the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara.

Witnesses reported seeing a black BMW speeding through the streets and spraying bullets at people and other targets in a beachside community where many college students live.

""This incident appears to be a mass murder situation,"" Sheriff Bill Brown told a televised news conference.

""We currently have seven people confirmed dead, that includes the suspect and six victims.""

A lawyer for Peter Rodger, who worked on the hit film The Hunger Games, says Mr Rodger believes his son Elliot was responsible for the shootings.

The lawyer said Mr Rodger's family called police weeks ago after Elliot posted alarming YouTube videos about murder and suicide.

""This child was being treated by multiple professionals. The child was diagnosed at an earlier age of being a highly functional Asperger's syndrome child,"" the lawyer said.

Sheriff Brown did not identify the suspect but said authorities were investigating a possible link with a threatening video apparently made by the gunman, who identifies himself as Elliot Rodger.

In the video, which features a black BMW, he says he is a 22-year-old virgin and repeatedly complains of loneliness and rejection by women, and threatens a mass slaughter of college students and Isla Vista residents.

""This is my last video, it all has to come to this,"" the man in the video says.

""Tomorrow is the day of retribution. The day on which I will have my revenge against humanity.

""I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It's an injustice, a crime.

""I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you, you will finally see that I am the truthful superior one. The true alpha male.""

YouTube has since removed the video, posting in its place a notice saying the video violated its terms of service.

Sheriff Brown said the video ""would appear to be connected"" to the shooting.

""We have obtained and are currently analysing both written and videotaped evidence that suggests this atrocity was a premeditated mass murder,"" Sheriff Brown said.

""We have identified nine separate crime scenes,"" he said, describing the situation in the streets of the college town as ""chaotic"".

The sheriff said deputies twice exchanged fire with the suspected gunman before his vehicle crashed.

He said the man died of a gunshot wound to the head, but could not immediately say if he was killed by deputies in the exchange of fire or died of a self-inflicted wound.

The names of the victims have not yet been released.

Richard Martinez said his son Christopher was one of those killed in the shooting and called for stricter controls on guns.

""Our son Christopher and six others are dead,"" he said.

""Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.

""They talk about gun rights; what about Chris's right to live? When will this insanity stop?""

At least seven people were injured and the suspect also died during the drive-by shooting on Friday in Isla Vista, near the campus of the University of California Santa Barbara. It was unclear whether the fatal shot was self-inflicted or delivered by police.

ABC News also identified the shooter as Elliot Rodger.



- Site of 2001 shooting -



Ambulances and police cars swarmed the streets after the shooting -- just the latest in a string of gun massacres that have rocked the United States in recent years.



Andrew Jun, a third year economics and accounting student, told AFP the situation was ""pretty surreal.""



""It's unbelievable that this kind of thing can happen,"" he said.



Other witnesses said they initially mistook the gunshots for fireworks or firecrackers.



Sienna Schwartz, her voice breaking, recalled how she came face-to-face with the gunman.



At first, she mistook the attacker's ""little black pistol"" for an airsoft gun.



""I turned around, and I started walking the other way. He shot, and I felt like -- I just felt, like, the wind pass right by my face,"" Schwartz told CNN as she choked back tears.



By grisly coincidence, in 2001, the son of ""Ally McBeal"" and ""The Wire"" television series director Daniel Attias ran down four pedestrians with his car on a crowded street just a block away from the scene of Friday's assault.



Witnesses said that part-time college student David Attias got out of the car after his deed and shouted ""I am the angel of death.""



He was ruled insane and locked up in a state hospital after being initially convicted of second-degree murder.



- Video could shed clues -



Authorities, who say Friday's shooter acted alone but have not released details on a possible motive, also are investigating the YouTube video.



In it, the man believed to be Rodger speaks of a ""day of retribution"" for his life of ""loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires.""



""I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up blonde slut I see inside there. All those girls that I've desired so much, they have all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man,"" he says.



The shooter twice exchanged gunfire with police from his car before crashing into a parked vehicle.



When officers approached him, the suspect ""was dead of an apparent gunshot wound to the head,"" according to the county sheriff Brown.



Police said they recovered a handgun from the car.



The shooting came just weeks before the end of the academic year, with some students preparing for graduation ceremonies while others were about to take final exams.



Located about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, the University of California Santa Barbara is home to over 20,000 undergraduate students, according to the institution's website.

A lawyer for Peter Rodger, who worked on the hit film The Hunger Games, says Mr Rodger believes his son Elliot was responsible for the shootings.

The lawyer said Mr Rodger's family called police weeks ago after Elliot posted alarming YouTube videos about murder and suicide.

""This child was being treated by multiple professionals. The child was diagnosed at an earlier age of being a highly functional Asperger's syndrome child,"" the lawyer said.

Sheriff Brown did not identify the suspect but said authorities were investigating a possible link with a threatening video apparently made by the gunman, who identifies himself as Elliot Rodger.

In the video, which features a black BMW, he says he is a 22-year-old virgin and repeatedly complains of loneliness and rejection by women, and threatens a mass slaughter of college students and Isla Vista residents.

""This is my last video, it all has to come to this,"" the man in the video says.

""Tomorrow is the day of retribution. The day on which I will have my revenge against humanity.

""I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. It's an injustice, a crime.

""I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you, you will finally see that I am the truthful superior one. The true alpha male.""

YouTube has since removed the video, posting in its place a notice saying the video violated its terms of service.

Sheriff Brown said the video ""would appear to be connected"" to the shooting.

""We have obtained and are currently analysing both written and videotaped evidence that suggests this atrocity was a premeditated mass murder,"" Sheriff Brown said.

""We have identified nine separate crime scenes,"" he said, describing the situation in the streets of the college town as ""chaotic"".

The sheriff said deputies twice exchanged fire with the suspected gunman before his vehicle crashed.

He said the man died of a gunshot wound to the head, but could not immediately say if he was killed by deputies in the exchange of fire or died of a self-inflicted wound.

The names of the victims have not yet been released.

Richard Martinez said his son Christopher was one of those killed in the shooting and called for stricter controls on guns.

""Our son Christopher and six others are dead,"" he said.

""Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.

""They talk about gun rights; what about Chris's right to live? When will this insanity stop?""

Witness Xavier Mozejewski told KEYT-TV the incident was like an ""old western shoot-out"".

College student Brad Martin told a university student newspaper that his girlfriend was ""absolutely hysterical"" after being approached by the gunman with a weapon she initially was not sure was real.

""She said the next second he raised it up to her face ... and she turned around and started running,"" she told the Daily Nexus.

""That's when she heard 'bang, bang, bang' right behind her as she was running.""","A drive-by shooter who killed six people in a US university town after venting about his sexual frustration online is thought to be a Hollywood director's son.

Here are five things to know about the attack:

Gunfire began pouring out of a black BMW around 9:30 p.m. Friday in the tiny community of Isla Vista, next to the university. By the time it stopped, seven people were dead, seven more injured and police were left with nine crime scenes to sift through. Witnesses reported hearing a barrage of gunfire, and one told a TV station that the gunman flashed his weapon at her moments before she felt bullets whizzing by her head. The shooter was involved in two gunbattles with police before he crashed his car. He was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head. It’s unclear if he committed suicide or was killed by police.

WHO WAS THE SHOOTER?

The family of Elliot Rodger, 22, believes he was the man who went on the shooting rampage, Alan Shifman, an attorney for Rodger’s father, Peter, said Saturday. “The Rodger family offers their deepest compassion and sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy. We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain, and our hearts go out to everybody involved,” Shifman said. Peter Rodger was an assistant director on “The Hunger Games.”

Law-enforcement officers have not identified Rodger as the suspect, however.

WHAT ABOUT THE YOUTUBE VIDEO?

There remain many unanswered questions about a seven-minute-long YouTube video in which a man outlines his plans for violent revenge because of repeated rejection from women. Police are analyzing the video as part of their investigation, but the identity of the person who made it couldn’t be independently confirmed. In it, the man sits in the driver’s seat of a car and threatens to kill sorority girls and people on the streets of Isla Vista. He said college has been a “torturous” experience for him and said at the age of 22 he had never kissed a girl and was a virgin. Shifman said the family called police several weeks ago after they were alarmed by YouTube videos about suicide and murders. It’s unclear whether the videos are related.

WHO WAS KILLED AND INJURED?

Authorities have not identified those who were killed. In a statement, the University of California, Santa Barbara said it’s “shocked and saddened” by the shootings. The university said several students were shot and taken to the hospital.

The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office is leading the investigation. “It’s obviously the work of a madman,” Sheriff Bill Brown said.",Here are five things to know about the attack

The gunman also died after exchanging fire with police, authorities said. It was not clear whether the fatal gunshot was self-inflicted or delivered by police. Driving a black BMW, the suspect opened fire on pedestrians from his vehicle at several locations in the town of Isla Vista in Santa Barbara on a busy Friday night.

Police are ‘analyzing both written and videotaped evidence that suggest this atrocity was a premeditated mass murder,’ Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told a press conference. ‘We have identified nine separate crime scenes,’ Brown said, describing the situation in the streets of the college town as ‘chaotic’. TV footage showed ambulances and police cars swarming the campus. Authorities believe the shooter acted alone and are investigating a threatening video posted by the alleged gunman on YouTube.

Police are looking into a possible link with a Youtube video in which a young man complains of repeated rejection by women and threatens to take revenge. Seven other people are in hospital, and being treated for bullet wounds. The shootings occurred at several sites in the town of Isla Vista, and there were nine crime scenes, police said.

Witnesses described seeing a black BMW speeding through the streets, with shots being fired at people. Student Michael Vitek told local TV station KEYT he had seen one woman being fatally struck and another critically injured. ‘I heard shots, scream, pain,’ he said.

They have not yet released the suspect’s name. The shooter twice exchanged gunfire with police from his car before crashing into a parked vehicle. When police approached him, the suspect ‘was dead of an apparent gunshot wound to the head,’ Brown said. Police said they recovered a handgun from the suspect’s vehicle. The shooting hit as the academic year was winding down, with some students preparing for graduation ceremonies, while others were about to take final exams.

School shootings have become a tragic periodic occurrence in the United States in recent years, from the December 2012 massacre at Newtown, Connecticut that left 20 small children dead to the Virginia Tech college shooting in April 2007 in which 33 people, including the lone gunman, lost their lives.

Police say they were alerted to the shootings around 21:30 on Friday (04:30 GMT on Saturday). Six minutes later, the suspect and responding officers exchanged gunfire. The suspect fled. But after a second exchange of fire with police, he eventually crashed into a parked vehicle.

He was found dead in his car with a bullet wound to the head. A semi-automatic handgun was recovered from the vehicle. Investigators know the suspect’s name but would not release it before all relatives were notified, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters.","Los Angeles  - Seven people were killed in a drive-by shooting at a university campus in southern California overnight Friday, in what police called"

Here's Why,"The entire state of California is in a severe drought. Farmers and farmworkers are hurting.

You might expect this to cause food shortages and higher prices across the country. After all, California grows 95 percent of America's broccoli, 81 percent of its carrots and 99 percent of the country's artichokes, almonds and walnuts, among other foods.

Yet there's been no sign of a big price shock. What gives?

Here are three explanations.

Drive southwest from Fresno, and you can easily see the drought's impact. In this area, farmers rely on the Westlands Water District for irrigation.

In a normal year, Westlands delivers water to each farm through a network of underground pipes. That water is drawn from artificial rivers that link this area to dams and reservoirs hundreds of miles away, mostly in the northern part of the state.

This year, because of the drought, Westlands cannot deliver any of that water. And the result is bare dirt where vegetables normally would grow.

Sarah Woolf takes me on a tour of her family's farm, and points toward one dry field. ""It had onions in it last year, and we're not farming it at all, because we don't have enough water supply,"" she says. (Woolf is also on the board of the Westlands Water District.)

But that's not the whole story in this region. I still see plenty of green: fields of alfalfa and garlic and leafy almond orchards.

They exist because many farmers here have a backup supply of water. They're pumping it out of underground aquifers.

This is happening all across the state. According to a new report from the University of California, Davis, the extra water that farmers will pump from their wells this year will make up for about 75 percent of the cutbacks in water from dams and reservoirs.

But this can't go on forever: That groundwater is limited. Woolf tells me that just this morning, she heard about problems at one of their wells. ""We have to actually drill down and drop the well deeper, which is a very bad sign,"" she says. It means that the water table is dropping; the aquifer is drying up.

2. Some parts of California are less dry than others.

Agriculture in California is spread around different parts of the state. One key region is the Salinas Valley, sometimes called America's salad bowl.

""In June, 90 percent of the lettuce in the United States is grown in the Salinas Valley,"" says Daniel Sumner, an economist at UC Davis. Yet there's ""no effect of the drought yet in the Salinas Valley.""

Those farms don't get water from California's dams and reservoirs, even in a normal year. They've always been able to rely on wells, and nothing's changed this year.

So fear not; there's plenty of baby spinach and mesclun mix.

In the winter, meanwhile, salad greens mostly come from areas far to the south, near the Mexican border. Those areas get their water from the Colorado River, which is also in relatively good shape this year thanks to snowfall far upstream.

3. The limited water is going to crops that consumers are most likely to notice.



Allen Peterson farms land near the town of Turlock, on the east side of the Central Valley. He grows mostly almonds, but also some corn and alfalfa, which he sells to dairy farmers nearby.

An irrigation canal runs right past his orchards. It's a concrete channel 18 feet wide and 6 feet deep, full of water.

That water supply is relatively secure; it comes straight from Lake Don Pedro, created by a dam that the Turlock Irrigation District helped to build. So Peterson is still getting about half of his normal allotment of water. It's enough to grow a crop, but not on every acre.

""I've kept water on our almond crop, which is a higher-value crop. I've left fallow some corn ground, to make sure I have enough water for my almonds,"" Peterson says.

That means he won't have corn to sell to his neighbors, the dairy farmers. Those dairy farmers are suffering from the drought. They're bringing in feed from far away, and it's expensive. Farmers in California are also growing less rice.

In other words, water is flowing toward food that consumers eat directly, because that's where the money is. Those also tend to be crops that California dominates. Less water is going toward production of crops like alfalfa or rice, which are available from other places or that consumers don't eat directly.

As a consequence, consumers are shielded from the drought's effects.

Sumner, the agricultural economist, says this is economics in action. ""People move the water to its highest-value use. People pay attention to markets. If you can't get something from California, you get it from somewhere else. That's what markets do. They're good at it,"" he says.

Of course, the drought is having an effect, just not a big one so far. A few farms have bulldozed almond and citrus trees because of water shortages. It's possible that citrus prices will rise next winter, because of shortfalls in production.

If the drought continues into next year, meanwhile, some of the current coping strategies may not work so well. The unrestricted use of groundwater is increasingly controversial. Some water experts are calling for limits on the amounts of water that farmers can draw from underground aquifers.

As it did in its first California action against Samsung in 2012, Apple is looking to leverage a jury's recent decision to net a permanent injunction of Samsung devices found in infringement of three patents. The company is also requesting a complete retrial of the damages case that ended in a $119.6 million award, much less than the $2.2 billion Apple was seeking.

On the issue of a permanent injunction, Apple is asserting that the continued sales of Samsung's infringing products would cause the company irreparable harm that cannot be remedied with monetary damages.

As noted by FOSS Patents' Florian Mueller, even if Apple wins an injunction, Samsung will likely be able to apply quick workarounds to skirt infringed patent claims.

Further, Apple v Samsung presiding Judge Lucy Koh already denied an injunction in the first California case, saying Apple's evidence did not sufficiently prove irreparable harm. Considering the current injunction is based on a similar piece of evidence, namely a conjoint consumer survey conducted by MIT professor John Hauser, the granting of an injunction from Koh would be surprising.

As for Apple's bid for a retrial, the company entered a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) seeking an order that additional Samsung products infringe certain patents, treble damages of the largest damages decision awarded by the jury or, in lieu of the previous, a complete retrial.

Described below in the 54-page filing, the request for a retrial applies to proposed motions for Samsung product injunctions and higher damages payouts relating to found infringed patents. These include the '647 data detectors, the '721 patent for ""slide-to-unlock"" functionality and the '172 patent for text prediction.

In addition, the filing states that ""Samsung's improper and prejudicial statements to the jury warrant a new trial on infringement for the '414 and '959 patents (in the event that the Court does not grant JMOL of infringement), a new trial on willfulness for all patents other than the '721 patent (and also other than the '647 patent if the Court grants JMOL of willfulness for that patent), and a new trial on damages for all five of Apple's asserted patents.""

While unlikely to be granted, Apple's last request seems to illustrate the company's displeasure of the jury's $119.6 million decision. The action contrasts a decidedly positive statement Apple issued after the verdict was handed down earlier this month.

Finally, Samsung also filed its own JMOL on Friday and, while the documents are sealed, Mueller believes the company is looking to reverse some or all of the jury's findings.","In two separate court filings on Friday, Apple lodged a motion for a permanent U.S. injunction on Samsung products found in infringement of certain utility patents by a jury earlier in May, while requesting a retrial of the same case."

A man who stabbed three people to death in his apartment before gunning down another three in a drive-by attack in California has been identified by police as the son of a Hollywood director.

Elliot Rodger, the son of Peter Rodger, an assistant director on The Hunger Games film, had earlier posted an internet video about his plan to kill women.

The 22-year-old man launched his attack on Saturday in Isla Vista, Santa Barbara, after revealing his plan in a Youtube video, saying he wanted revenge for being rejected.

He was later found dead after an exchange of fire with police.

Another seven people remained hospitalised with serious injuries.

The attack happened near the campus of the University of Santa Barbara. Witnesses reported seeing the attacker firing indiscriminately from a black BMW.

The video posted on Youtube shows the man, who says he is a 22-year-old virgin who has been rejected by women.

“I will have my revenge against humanity,” he says, adding he will retaliate with a mass slaughter of college students and Isla Vista residents. “I will punish all of you for it.”

Describing the attack as “mass murder”, Bill Brown, a county sheriff, said that police exchanged fire at least twice with the attacker before his car crashed.

The attacker was found dead in the car with a gunshot wound to the head, and authorities recovered a semi-automatic handgun, Brown said.

A lawyer for Peter Rodger, Alan Shifman, had made a statement after the shootings, saying that his client believed the attacker was his son.

The Rodger family had contacted police after the video was posted a few weeks ago, Shifman said.

The lawyer said the family was alarmed by the video “regarding suicide and the killing of people” that Elliot had been posting.

Police interviewed Elliot and did not find a history of guns, but the officers left after determining he didn’t need to be locked up for mental health reasons, Shifman said.

He was being treated by several mental health professionals, according to media reports.",Police identify man who kills six people in California stabbings and drive-by shootings before dying of gunshot wound.

Also, it's been reported that Rodger wrote a 140-page memoir-manifesto at some point prior to his shooting spree that killed six. The memoir-manifesto can be read here.

Update 7:30 p.m. EDT: University of California President Janet Napolitano says a mass shooting in the community around UC Santa Barbara is ""almost the kind of event that's impossible to prevent and impossible to predict,"" according to the Associated Press.

The former secretary of Homeland Security, who took over as head of the UC system in September, made her remarks following a commencement speech in Oakland on Saturday, a day after the rampage that authorities say left seven people including the gunman dead and seven others injured.

UC Santa Barbara says students were among the victims, the AP reported. Napolitano issued a statement saying she's ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the shooting and sending thoughts and prayers ""to the victims of this tragedy, their families and the entire Santa Barbara community."" She says she's working with UCSB to help students and families, the AP added.

Update 2:18 p.m. EDT: YouTube has taken down the Elliot Rodger's video but the video has been reposted on LiveLeak and can be viewed below.

The Santa Barbara County sheriff's office reports seven individuals, including the suspect, were killed in an apparent mass murder near the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) early Saturday morning. Seven additional individuals were treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries at local hospitals. The sheriff has yet to identify the alleged suspect but it is believed a YouTube video, entitled ""Elliot Rodger's Retribution,"" may be linked to the mass murder. The shooting occured at 9:27 p.m. PDT (12:27 a.m. EDT).

According to the Santa Barbara County sheriff's office's statement on the shooting, ""Seven people are dead, including a suspect, and seven people are wounded following a series of shootings in Isla Vista. The identities of those who were killed are not being released until next of kin notifications are made. Of the seven people in the hospital, all are being treated for gunshot wounds or traumatic injuries and at least one of the victims has undergone surgery.""

The suspect's identity has yet to be publicly revealed, but the sheriff's office states they have made an initial identification and are currently looking at several pieces of evidence that may be linked to the UCSB shooting. Per the statement, ""the deceased subject has been preliminarily identified but his name is not being released until a positive identification is made. It appears the suspect acted alone.

(AP) — A Hollywood director believes his son was the lone gunman who went on a shooting rampage near the University of California, Santa Barbara that killed six people — weeks after the family had called police about disturbing YouTube videos he had posted, his lawyer said Saturday.

Deputies found the gunman dead behind the wheel of his crashed BMW with a gunshot wound to his head Friday night in the beach neighborhood of Isla Vista, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. The rampage also left seven others hospitalized with gunshot wounds or other major injuries, including one who underwent a life-saving surgery.

Alan Shifman — a lawyer who represents Peter Rodger, one of the assistant directors on “The Hunger Games” — issued a statement on behalf of the family saying they believe Rodger’s son, Elliot Rodger, was the shooter.

“The Rodger family offers their deepest compassion and sympathy to the families involved in this terrible tragedy. We are experiencing the most inconceivable pain, and our hearts go out to everybody involved,” Shifman said.

Authorities have not confirmed the identity of the shooter.

The shootings started around 9:30 p.m. in Isla Vista, a roughly half-square mile community next to UC Santa Barbara’s campus and picturesque beachside cliffs.

Alexander Mattera, 23, said his friend Chris Johnson was walking out of an improv comedy show when he was shot in front of a popular pizza place. He stumbled into a nearby house.

“He walked into these random guys’ house bleeding,” he said.

Mattera was sitting at a bonfire with friends when at least one gunshot whizzed overhead. The friends ran for cover when they heard the barrage of gunfire.

“We heard so many gunshots. It was unbelievable. I thought they were firecrackers. There had to have been at least like two guns. There were a lot of shots,” he said.

The gunman got into two gun battles before crashing his black BMW into a parked car. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he was killed by gunfire or if he committed suicide.

A semi-automatic handgun was recovered from the scene near the university.

A visibly shaken student told KEYT-TV that she was approached by the driver of a black BMW who flashed a handgun and asked “Hey, what’s up?” The student, who didn’t provide her full name, said she thought he was carrying an airsoft gun and kept walking. She said seconds later, she felt something buzz by her head and quickly realized they were bullets.

Kathrin Schirazi Rad got a call from her 21-year-old son, Adrian Timothy Petersson, who told her in a shaky voice that he had been knocked off his skateboard by a BMW being chased by police about 9 p.m. Friday. He hurt his shoulder, but he went home after being checked by first responders to the scene.

“He was in shock,” said Rad, who lives in Sweden. “He saw some plastic bags and said somebody must have died.”

The victims’ identities were not immediately released.

In a statement, the university said it’s “shocked and saddened” by the shootings. The university said several students were shot and taken to the hospital.

“This is almost the kind of event that’s impossible to prevent and almost impossible to predict,” UC President Janet Napolitano told reporters after giving the commencement speech at Laney College in Oakland, California.

Describing the shootings as “premeditated mass murder,” Brown said authorities were analyzing a disturbing YouTube video posted that shows a young man describing plans to shoot women that appears to be connected to the attack.

“It’s obviously the work of a madman,” Brown said.

In the YouTube video, posted Friday, the man sits in a car and looks at the camera, laughing often, and says he is going to take his revenge against humanity. He describes loneliness and frustration because “girls have never been attracted to me,” and says, at age 22, he is still a virgin. The video, which is almost seven minutes long, appears scripted. The identity of the person in the video could not be independently confirmed.

Shifman said the family called police several weeks ago after being alarmed by YouTube videos “regarding suicide and the killing of people.”

Police interviewed Elliot Rodger and found him to be a “perfectly polite, kind and wonderful human,” he added. Police did not find a history of guns, but did say Rodger “didn’t have a lot of friends,” had trouble making friends and didn’t have any girlfriends.

The family is not ready to speak publicly yet, the lawyer said, but wants to cooperate fully with police, public agencies and “any other person who feels that they need to help prevent these situations from ever occurring again,” Shifman said.

“My client’s mission in life will be to try to prevent any such tragedies from ever happening again,” he said. “This country, this world, needs to address mental illness and the ramifications from not recognizing these illnesses.”

Shifman said the family is “staunchly against guns” and supports gun-control laws. “They are extremely, extremely upset that anybody was hurt under these circumstances,” he said.

Isla Vista has a reputation for excessive partying. Last month, an annual spring bash spiraled into violence as young people clashed with police and tossed rocks and bottles. A university police officer and four deputies were injured and 130 people were arrested.

The community has experienced other tragedies in the past.

In 2001, the son of “Ally McBeal” TV director Daniel Attias ran down four pedestrians with his car on a crowded Isla Vista street. Witnesses testified that part-time college student David Attias got of the car and shouted: “I am the angel of death.”

David Attias was ruled insane after he was convicted of second-degree murder and is locked up in a state mental hospital.

Dillon reported from Goleta, California, and Watson reported from San Diego. Associated Press writer Gillian Flaccus contributed from Los Angeles.

Police have not identified the shooter, but Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said that a YouTube video titled “Elliot Rodger’s Retribution” is linked to the shooting, ABC News reported.

In the ominous video, a man, who identifies himself as 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, sits in a parked car and says he has felt lonely and rejected for eight years.

He blames his unhappiness on women who have rejected him. He also says he wants to kill men “just for the crime of living a better life” than him.

“If I can’t have you, girls, I will destroy you,” he says. “You deserve to be annihilated, and I will give that to you.”

Roger is stoic as he details his plans to “slay every single person” he sees on the street.

“I’ll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am in truth the superior one, the true alpha male,” he says.

“I will be a god compared to you. You will all be animals. You are animals, and I will slaughter you like animals,” he continues. “I hate all of you. Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species.”

Friday night’s rampage broke out around 9:30 p.m. in a UC Santa Barbara student enclave reputed for parties.

Brown said the shootings occurred at several sites, resulting in nine crime scenes.

The attacks ended when the gunman exchanged gunfire with deputies in the beachside community of Isla Vista, Brown said.

He crashed his black BMW into a parked car, and deputies found him dead with a gunshot wound to the head, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether he was killed by gunfire or if he committed suicide, he said.

A semiautomatic handgun was recovered from the scene near the school.

Investigators know the gunman’s name, but Brown said he couldn’t release it pending notification of relatives.

“We’re analyzing both written and videotaped evidence that this atrocity was a premeditated mass murder,” Brown said.

A student told KEYT-TV he saw shots fired from a BMW, fatally striking one woman and critically injuring another woman.

“I heard shots, scream, pain,” Michael Vitak said. “All emotions. I hope she is going to be fine.”

A visibly shaken student told the station she was approached by the driver of a black BMW who flashed a handgun and asked “Hey, what’s up?” The student, who didn’t provide her full name, said she thought he was carrying an airsoft gun and kept walking. She said seconds later, she felt something buzz by her head and quickly realized they were bullets.

The victims’ identities were not immediately released. Brown said the injured were being treated for gunshot wounds and traumatic injuries, including at least one person who underwent surgery for life-threatening injuries.

This post is in partnership with 24/7Wall Street. The article below was originally published on 247wallst.com.

The United States is currently engulfed in one of the worst droughts in recent memory. More than 30% of the country experienced at least moderate drought as of last week’s data.

In seven states drought conditions were so severe that each had more than half of its land area in severe drought. Severe drought is characterized by crop loss, frequent water shortages, and mandatory water use restrictions. Based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the states with the highest levels of severe drought.

In an interview, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) meteorologist Brad Rippey, told 24/7 Wall St. that drought has been a long-running issue in parts of the country. “This drought has dragged on for three and a half years in some areas, particularly [in] North Texas,” Rippey said.

While large portions of the seven states suffer from severe drought, in some parts of these states drought conditions are even worse. In six of the seven states with the highest levels of drought, more than 30% of each state was in extreme drought as of last week, a more severe level of drought characterized by major crop and pasture losses, as well as widespread water shortages. Additionally, in California and Oklahoma, 25% and 30% of the states, respectively, suffered from exceptional drought, the highest severity classification. Under exceptional drought, crop and pasture loss is widespread, and shortages of well and reservoir water can lead to water emergencies.

Drought has had a major impact on important crops such as winter wheat. “So much of the winter wheat is grown across the southern half of the Great Plains,” Rippey said, an area that includes Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, three of the hardest-hit states. Texas alone had nearly a quarter of a million farms in 2012, the most out of any state, while neighboring Oklahoma had more than 80,000 farms, trailing only three other states.

In the Southwest, concerns are less-focused on agriculture and more on reservoir levels, explained Rippey. In Arizona, reservoir levels were just two-thirds of their usual average. Worse still, in New Mexico, reservoir stores were only slightly more than half of their normal levels. “And Nevada is the worst of all. We see storage there at about a third of what you would expect,” Rippey said.

The situation in California may well be the most problematic of any state. The entire state was suffering from severe drought as of last week, and 75% of all land area was under extreme drought. “Reservoirs which are generally fed by the Sierra Nevadas and the southern Cascades [are] where we see the real problems,” Rippey said. Restrictions on agricultural water use has forced many California farmers to leave fields fallow, he added. “At [the current] usage rate, California has less than two years of water remaining.”

The U.S. Drought Monitor is produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the seven states with the highest proportions of total area classified in at least a state of severe drought as of May 13, 2014. We also reviewed figures recently published by the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service as part of its 2012 Census of Agriculture.

These are the seven states running out of water.

California had the nation’s worst drought problem with more than 76% of the state experiencing extreme drought as of last week. Drought in California has worsened considerably in recent years. Severe drought conditions covered the entire state, as of last week. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency earlier this year as the drought worsened. California had 465,422 hired farm workers in 2012, more than any other state. Farm workers would likely suffer further if conditions persist. The shortage of potable water has been so severe that California is now investing in long-term solutions, such as desalination plants. A facility that is expected to be the largest in the Western hemisphere is currently under construction in Southern California, and another desalination facility is under consideration in Orange County.

Nearly 40% of Nevada was covered in extreme drought last week, among the highest rates in the country. The drought in the state has worsened since the week of April 15, when 33.5% of the state was covered in extreme drought. According to the Las Vegas Valley Water District (LVVWD), the main cause of the drought this year has been below average snowfall in the Rocky Mountains. Melting snow from the Rocky Mountains eventually flows into Lake Mead, which provides most of the Las Vegas Valley with water. John Entsminger, head of both the LVVWD and the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said that the effects of the drought on the state has been “every bit as serious as a Hurricane Katrina or a Superstorm Sandy.”

More than 86% of New Mexico was covered in severe drought as of last week, more than any state except for Nevada and California. Additionally, one-third of the state was in extreme drought, worse than just a month earlier, when only one-quarter of the state was covered in extreme drought. However, conditions were better than they were one year ago, when virtually the entire state was in at least severe drought, with more than 80% in extreme drought conditions. NOAA forecasts conditions may improve in much of the state this summer.
